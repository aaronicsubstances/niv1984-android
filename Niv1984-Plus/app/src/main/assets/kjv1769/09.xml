            <content> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>And he had two wives; the name of the one </content>
            <content kind="EM">was</content>
            <content> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, </content>
            <content kind="EM">were</content>
            <content> there.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>And </content>
            <content kind="EM">as</content>
            <content> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? </content>
            <content kind="EM">am</content>
            <content> not I better to thee than ten sons?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>And she </content>
            <content kind="EM">was</content>
            <content> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I </content>
            <content kind="EM">am</content>
            <content> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</content>

            <content>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant </content>

            <content>And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more </content>

            <content>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, </content>

            <content>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, </content>

        <verse num="23">
            <content>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</content>
