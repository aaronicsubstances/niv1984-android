            <content>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</content>

            <content>And it was so, when the days of </content>

            <content kind="EM">according</content>
            <content> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </content>

        <verse num="9">
            <content>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</content>

            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath </content>

            <content> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</content>

            <content>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</content>

            <content>And the Sabeans fell </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</content>

            <content>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</content>

    <chapter num="2">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </content>

            <content> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</content>

        <verse num="6">
            <content>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he </content>

            <content> in thine hand; but save his life.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that </content>

            <content> grief was very great.</content>

    <chapter num="3">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</content>

            <content>And Job spake, and said,</content>
