            <content>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which </content>
            <content kind="EM">are</content>
            <content> of your sort? then shall ye make </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</content>

        <verse num="19">
            <content>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</content>

            <content>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</content>

        <verse num="6">
