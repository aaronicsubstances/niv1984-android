            <content>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that </content>
            <content kind="EM">were</content>
            <content> in the ship into the sea, to lighten </content>
            <content kind="EM">it</content>
            <content> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> upon us; What </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> thy country? and of what people </content>
            <content kind="EM">art</content>
            <content> thou?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>And he said unto them, I </content>
            <content kind="EM">am</content>
            <content> an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry </content>

            <content>.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> upon you.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring </content>
            <content kind="EM">it</content>
            <content> to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</content>
        </verse>
    </chapter>
    <chapter num="2">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, </content>
            <content kind="EM">and</content>
            <content> thou heardest my voice.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>The waters compassed me about, </content>
            <content kind="EM">even</content>
            <content> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars </content>
            <content kind="EM">was</content>
            <content> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay </content>
            <content kind="EM">that</content>
            <content> that I have vowed. Salvation </content>
            <content kind="EM">is</content>
            <content> of the LORD.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry </content>

    <chapter num="3">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered </content>

            <content> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</content>
        </verse>

        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did </content>

            <content>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, </content>
            <content kind="EM">was</content>
            <content> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou </content>

            <content> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made </content>

            <content> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, </content>

            <content>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and </content>
