        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</content>

            <content>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</content>
