            <note_ref>1</note_ref>
            <content> formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. </content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</content>

            <content>And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>God made two great lights--the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.</content>

            <content>God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,</content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</content>

        <verse num="22">
            <content>God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."</content>

        <verse num="25">
            <content>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</content>

            <content>When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted--thin and scorched by the east wind.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.</content>

        <verse num="11">
            <content>Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. </content>

            <content>So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."</content>

        <verse num="16">
            <content>"I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."</content>

            <content>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,</content>

            <content>After them, seven other cows came up--scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.</content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.</content>

            <content>"In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.</content>

            <content>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."</content>

            <content>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</content>

            <content>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.</content>

            <content>The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.</content>

        <verse num="28">
            <content>"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.</content>

            <content>The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.</content>

        <verse num="32">
            <content>The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="33">
            <content>"And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.</content>

        <verse num="34">
            <content>Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="35">
            <content>They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.</content>

            <content>So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God </content>

            <content>Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.</content>
