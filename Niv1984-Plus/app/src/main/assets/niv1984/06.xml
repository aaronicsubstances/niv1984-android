        <verse num="3">
            <content>I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.</content>

            <content>So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them.

            <content>Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</content>
