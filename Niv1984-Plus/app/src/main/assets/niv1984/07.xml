        <verse num="18">
            <content>Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</content>

        <verse num="19">
            <content>But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.</content>

        <verse num="1">
            <content>Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>announce now to the people, `Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>But the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, `This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, `This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>The LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</content>

            <content>and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.</content>

        <verse num="13">
            <content>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands."</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.</content>

            <content>"Watch me," he told them. "Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.</content>

            <content>Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.</content>

        <verse num="20">
            <content>The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.</content>

        <verse num="22">
            <content>When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.</content>

    </chapter>
    <chapter num="8">
        <verse num="1">
            <content>Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?</content>

        <verse num="2">
            <content>The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.</content>

            <content>Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.</content>

            <content>The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels</content>

            <content>Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs</content>

            <content>With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.</content>

            <content>So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>"O LORD, the God of Israel," they cried, "why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?"</content>

        <verse num="4">
            <content>Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>Then the Israelites asked, "Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD?" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>"How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>"This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin."</content>

        <verse num="12">
            <content>They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.</content>

            <content>Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.</content>

        <verse num="14">
            <content>So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.</content>

        <verse num="15">
            <content>The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: `Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'</content>

        <verse num="19">
            <content>But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, `Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.</content>

        <verse num="24">
            <content>At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.</content>
