            <content>The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah--the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</content>

        <verse num="2">
            <content>Hear, O peoples, all of you, listen, O earth and all who are in it, that the Sovereign LORD may witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem? </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.</content>

        <verse num="7">
            <content>All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used." </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</content>
