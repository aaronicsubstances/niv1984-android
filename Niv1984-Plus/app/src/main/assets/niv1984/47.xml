            <content>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: </content>

            <content>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."</content>

            <content>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,</content>

            <content>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</content>

            <content>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.</content>

            <content>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</content>

            <content>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.</content>

            <content>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</content>

            <content>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</content>

        <verse num="4">
            <content>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.</content>

            <content>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</content>

        <verse num="8">
            <content>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</content>

            <content>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.</content>

            <content>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</content>

            <content>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.</content>

            <content>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</content>

            <content>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.</content>

            <content>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.</content>

        <verse num="10">
            <content>That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</content>

            <content>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</content>
