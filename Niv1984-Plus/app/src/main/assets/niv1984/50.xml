        <verse num="7">
            <content>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.</content>

            <content>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.</content>

            <content>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</content>

        <verse num="19">
            <content>for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. </content>

        <verse num="21">
            <content>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</content>

            <content>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel</content>

        <verse num="28">
            <content>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.</content>
