            <content>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="18">
            <content>He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="22">
            <content>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="23">
            <content>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="24">
            <content>and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="25">
            <content>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="26">
            <content>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="27">
            <content>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</content>

            <content>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</content>

        <verse num="3">
            <content>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</content>

        <verse num="5">
            <content>Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</content>

            <content>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</content>

            <content>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," </content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!</content>

        <verse num="14">
            <content>What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</content>

        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</content>

        <verse num="18">
            <content>But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</content>
