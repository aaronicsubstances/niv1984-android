            <content>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="14">
            <content>because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." </content>

            <content>We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="19">
            <content>And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="20">
            <content>Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="21">
            <content>For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</content>

            <content>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.</content>

            <content>In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</content>

            <content>Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
            <content>I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
            <content>First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="4">
            <content>They will say, "Where is this `coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="5">
            <content>But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="6">
            <content>By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="7">
            <content>By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="8">
            <content>But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="9">
            <content>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
            <content>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. </content>

            <content> </content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="11">
            <content>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="12">
            <content>as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. </content>

            <content> That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="13">
            <content>But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.</content>

        <verse num="14">
            <content>So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="15">
            <content>Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="16">
            <content>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</content>
        </verse>
        <verse num="17">
            <content>Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.</content>

        <verse num="18">
            <content>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen. </content>
