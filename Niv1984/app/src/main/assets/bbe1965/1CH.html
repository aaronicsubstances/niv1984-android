<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-971-29-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now as far as I am able, I have made ready what is needed for the house of my God; the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the silver things, and the brass for the brass things, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; beryls and jewels to be framed, and stones of different colours for ornament; all sorts of stones of great price, and polished building-stone, as much as is needed and more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-972-29-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And because this house of God is dear to me, I give my private store of gold and silver to the house of my God, in addition to all I have got ready for the holy house;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-975-29-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the heads of families and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the controllers of the king's business, freely gave themselves;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-976-29-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they gave for the use of the house of the Lord, five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-977-29-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And those who had stones of great price gave them to the store of the house of the Lord, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-991-29-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And with great joy they made a feast before the Lord that day.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-992-29-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So Solomon was put on the seat of the Lord as king in place of his father David, and everything went well for him; and all Israel was under his authority.</span></div>
