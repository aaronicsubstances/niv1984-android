<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We give praise to God at all times for you, keeping you in memory in our prayers;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Being conscious, my brothers, dear to God, that you have been marked out by God's purpose;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And you took us and the Lord as your example, after the word had come to you in much trouble, with joy in the Holy Spirit;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God is made clear; so that we have no need to say anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For they themselves give the news of how we came among you; and how you were turned from images to God, to the worship of a true and living God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Waiting for his Son from heaven, who came back from the dead, even Jesus, our Saviour from the wrath to come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For you yourselves, brothers, are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw, at Philippi, by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear, though everything was against us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God, so we give it out; not as pleasing men, but God by whom our hearts are tested.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth-sounding false words, and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Or looking for glory from men, from you or from others, when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But we were gentle among you, like a woman caring for her little ones:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Even so, being full of loving desire for you, we took delight in giving you not only God's good news, but even our lives, because you were dear to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you have the memory, my brothers, of our trouble and care; how, working night and day, so that we might not be a trouble to any of you, we gave you the good news of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, with God, how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Even as you saw how, like a father with his children, we were teaching and comforting you all, and giving witness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So that your lives might be pleasing to God, who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And for this cause we still give praise to God, that, when the word came to your ears through us, you took it, not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, which has living power in you who have faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, my brothers, took as your examples the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus; because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the Jews;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Who put to death the Lord Jesus and the prophets, violently driving us out; who are unpleasing to God and against all men;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Who, to make the measure of their sins complete, kept us from giving the word of salvation to the Gentiles: but the wrath of God is about to come on them in the fullest degree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But we, my brothers, being away from you for a short time, in body but not in heart, had all the more desire to see your face;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For which reason we made attempts to come to you, even I, Paul, once and again; but Satan kept us from coming.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus, at his coming?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For you are our glory and our joy.</span></div>

<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-3'>1 Thessalonians</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>At last our desire to have news of you was so strong that, while we ourselves were waiting at Athens,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to give you strength and comfort in your faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So that no man might be moved by these troubles; because you see that these things are part of God's purpose for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when we were with you, we said to you that trouble was before us; and so it came about, as you see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this reason, when I was no longer able to keep quiet, I sent to get news of your faith, fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you have happy memories of us, desiring greatly to see us, even as we do to see you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For this cause, brothers, in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For how great is the praise which we give to God for you, and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men, even as our love to you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</span></div>

<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-4'>1 Thessalonians</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And last of all, the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus, is this: that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to God, as in fact you are doing now, so you will go on in these ways, but more and more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For the purpose of God for you is this: that you may be holy, and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not in the passion of evil desires, like the Gentiles, who have no knowledge of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business: for the Lord is the judge in all these things, as we said to you before and gave witness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-57-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because it is God's purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Whoever, then, goes against this word, goes against not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But about loving the brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter: for you have the teaching of God that love for one another is right and necessary;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And, truly, you are lovers of all the brothers in Macedonia; but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business, working with your hands as we gave you orders;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That you may be respected by those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But it is our desire, brothers, that you may be certain about those who are sleeping; so that you may have no need for sorrow, as others have who are without hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-64-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again, even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by God's power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-65-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are still living at the coming of the Lord, will not go before those who are sleeping.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-66-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority, with the voice of the chief angel, with the sound of a horn: and the dead in Christ will come to life first;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-67-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the Lord in the air: and so will we be for ever with the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-4-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So then, give comfort to one another with these words.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-72-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-74-5-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-79-5-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-81-5-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-82-5-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-83-5-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</span></div>
