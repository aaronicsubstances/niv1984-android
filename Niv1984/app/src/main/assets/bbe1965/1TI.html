<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the order of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>It was my desire, when I went on into Macedonia, that you might make a stop at Ephesus, to give orders to certain men not to put forward a different teaching,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations, from which come questionings and doubts, in place of God's ordered way of life which is in faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart, and a knowledge of what is right, and true faith:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>From which some have been turned away, giving themselves to foolish talking;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Desiring to be teachers of the law, though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We are conscious that the law is good, if a man makes a right use of it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>With the knowledge that the law is made, not for the upright man, but for those who have no respect for law and order, for evil men and sinners, for the unholy and those who have no religion, for those who put their fathers or mothers to death, for takers of life,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For those who go after loose women, for those with unnatural desires, for those who take men prisoners, who make false statements and false oaths, and those who do any other things against the right teaching,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great God, which was given into my care.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I give praise to him who gave me power, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he took me to be true, making me his servant,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Though I had said violent words against God, and done cruel acts, causing great trouble: but I was given mercy, because I did it without knowledge, not having faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the grace of our Lord was very great, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>It is a true saying, in which all may put their faith, that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners, of whom I am the chief:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But for this reason I was given mercy, so that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might make clear all his mercy, as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now to the King eternal, ever-living, unseen, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. So be it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This order I give to you, Timothy my son, in harmony with the words of the prophets about you, so that by them you may be strong, fighting the good fight,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Keeping faith, and being conscious of well-doing; for some, by not doing these things, have gone wrong in relation to the faith:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given up to Satan, so that they may say no more evil words against God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve;</span></div>
