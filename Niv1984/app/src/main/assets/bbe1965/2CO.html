<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And our hope for you is certain; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles, so you will take part in the comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons, praise may go up to God for us from all of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For in our letters we say no other things to you, but those which you are reading, and to which you give agreement, and, it is my hope, will go on doing so to the end:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia, and from there to come back again to you, so that you might send me on my way to Judaea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But it was my decision for myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and there was an open door for me in the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there: so I went away from them, and came into Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To the one it is a perfume of death to death; to the other a perfume of life to life. And who is enough for such things?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right? or have we need, as some have, of letters of approval to you or from you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>You yourselves are our letter, whose writing is in our heart, open for every man's reading and knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For you are clearly a letter of Christ, the fruit of our work, recorded not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in stone, but in hearts of flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And this is the certain faith which we have in God through Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit; but our power comes from God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter gives death, but the Spirit gives life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For if the operation of the law, giving death, recorded in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory, a glory which was only for a time:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Will not the operation of the Spirit have a much greater glory?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For if the operation of the law, producing punishment, had its glory, how much greater will be the operation of the Spirit causing righteousness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory, because of the greater glory of that which comes after.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-57-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For if the order which was for a time had its glory, much more will the eternal order have its glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Having then such a hope, we keep nothing back,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face, so that the children of Israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But their minds were made hard: for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted; though it is taken away in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But to this day, at the reading of the law of Moses, a veil is over their heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when it is turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there the heart is free.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And we have given up the secret things of shame, not walking in false ways, and not making use of the word of God with deceit; but by the revelation of what is true, as before God, we have the approval of every man's sense of right and wrong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-69-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But if our good news is veiled, it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-76-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-77-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For, while living, we are still being given up to death because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our flesh, though it is under the power of death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-78-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So then, death is working in us, but life in you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-131-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Let your hearts be open to us: we have done no man wrong, no man has been damaged by us, we have made no profit out of any man,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-133-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>My words to you are without fear, I am full of pride on account of you: I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-134-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-135-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-141-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-142-7-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all.</span></div>
