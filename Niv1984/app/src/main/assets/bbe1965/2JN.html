<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love.</span></div>
