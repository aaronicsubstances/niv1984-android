<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Ahab, Moab made itself free from the authority of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now Ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in Samaria, and was ill. And he sent men, and said to them, Put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, about the outcome of my disease, to see if I will get well or not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Go now, and, meeting the men sent by the king of Samaria, say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you are going to get directions from Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Give ear then to the words of the Lord: You will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you. Then Elijah went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the men he had sent came back to the king; and he said to them, Why have you come back?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And they said to him, On our way we had a meeting with a man who said, Go back to the king who sent you and say to him, The Lord says, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? For this reason, you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said to them, What sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they said in answer, He was a man clothed in a coat of hair, with a leather band about his body. Then he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill, and said to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. Then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men; and he said to Elijah, O man of God, the king says, Come down quickly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Elijah in answer said, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men, and put an end to you. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and put an end to him and his fifty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men; and the third captain of fifty went up, and falling on his knees before Elijah, requesting mercy of him, said, O man of God, let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; but now let my life be of value in your eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the angel of the Lord said to Elijah, Go down with him; have no fear of him. So he got up and went down with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said to him, This is the word of the Lord: Because you sent men to put a question to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up, but death will certainly come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So death came to him, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah. And Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; because he had no son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a great wind, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Elijah said to Elisha, Come no farther for the Lord has sent me to Beth-el. But Elisha said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went down to Beth-el.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And at Beth-el the sons of the prophets came out to Elisha and said, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today?

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on to Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And at Jericho the sons of the prophets came up to Elisha and said to him, Has it been made clear to you that the Lord is going to take away your master from over you today? And he said in answer, Yes, I have knowledge of it: say no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, Come no farther, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. But he said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not be parted from you. So they went on together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off, while the two of them were by the edge of Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Elijah took off his robe, and, rolling it up, gave the water a blow with it, and the waters were parted, flowing back this way and that, so that they went over on dry land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had come to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, Say what you would have me do for you before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, Be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he said, You have made a hard request: still, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will get your desire; but if not, it will not be so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And while they went on their way, going on talking together, suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and Elijah went up to heaven in a great wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when Elisha saw it he gave a cry, My father, my father, the carriages of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no longer; and he was full of grief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then he took up Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and went back till he came to the edge of Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he took Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and giving the water a blow with it, said, Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that; and Elisha went over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they came out to him, and went down on the earth before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they said, Your servants have with us here fifty strong men; be pleased to let them go in search of Elijah; for it may be that the spirit of the Lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley. But he said, Do not send them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But when they kept on requesting him, he was shamed and said, Send, then. So they sent fifty men; but after searching for three days, they came back without having seen him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And they came back to him, while he was still at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now the men of the town said to Elisha, You see that the position of this town is good; but the water is bad, causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So he said, Get me a new vessel, and put salt in it; and they took it to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he went out to the spring from which the water came, and put salt in it, and said, The Lord says, Now I have made this water sweet; no longer will it be death-giving or unfertile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the water was made sweet again to this day, as Elisha said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then from there he went up to Beth-el; and on his way, some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him, crying, Go up, old no-hair! go up, old no-hair!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And turning back, he saw them, and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the wood and put forty-two of the children to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>From there he went to Mount Carmel, and came back from there to Samaria.</span></div>

<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-3'>2 Kings</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And Jehoram, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and he was king for twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He did evil in the eyes of the Lord; but not like his father and his mother, for he put away the stone pillar of Baal which his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But still he did the same sins which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do; he went on in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mesha, king of Moab, was a sheep-farmer; and he gave regularly to the king of Israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab got free from the authority of the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>At that time, King Jehoram went out from Samaria and got all Israel together in fighting order.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he sent to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has got free from my authority: will you go with me to make war on Moab? And he said, I will go with you: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom by a roundabout way for seven days: and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said, Here is trouble: for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may get directions from the Lord? And one of the king of Israel's men said in answer, Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who was servant to Elijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father and your mother. And the king of Israel said, No; for the Lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now, get me a player of music, and it will come about that while the man is playing, the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord: and they got a player of music, and while the man was playing, the hand of the Lord was on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-64-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said, The Lord says, I will make this valley full of water-holes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-65-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the Lord says, Though you see no wind or rain, the valley will be full of water, and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-66-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this will be only a small thing to the Lord: in addition he will give the Moabites into your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-67-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And you are to put every walled town to destruction, cutting down every good tree, and stopping up every water-spring, and making all the good land rough with stones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now in the morning, about the time when the offering was made, they saw water flowing from the direction of Edom till the country was full of water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-69-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now all Moab, hearing that the kings had come to make war against them, got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-70-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And early in the morning they got up, when the sun was shining on the water, and they saw the water facing them as red as blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-71-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-72-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-3-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Pulling down the towns, covering every good field with stones, stopping up all the water-springs, and cutting down all the good trees; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites; and the fighting-men went round the town raining stones on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-74-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-75-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall.
