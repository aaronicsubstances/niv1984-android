<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I have given an earlier account, O Theophilus, of all the things which Jesus did, and of his teaching from the first,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders, through the Holy Spirit, to the Apostles of whom he had made selection:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living, after his death; for he was seen by them for forty days, and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they were all together, with him, he gave them orders not to go away from Jerusalem, but to keep there, waiting till the word of the Father was put into effect, of which, he said, I have given you knowledge:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For the baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit, after a little time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So, when they were together, they said to him, Lord, will you at this time give back the kingdom to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said to them, It is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the Father has kept in his control.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you will have power, when the Holy Spirit has come on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when he had said these things, while they were looking, he was taken up, and went from their view into a cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And while they were looking up to heaven with great attention, two men came to them, in white clothing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And said, O men of Galilee, why are you looking up into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come again, in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And in those days Peter got up among the brothers (there were about one hundred and twenty of them), and said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>My brothers, the word of God had to be put into effect, which the Holy Spirit had said before, by the mouth of David, about Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For he was numbered among us, and had his part in our work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem, so that the field was named in their language, Akel-dama, or, The field of blood.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For this reason, of the men who have been with us all the time, while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us, one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they made selection of two, Joseph, named Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they made prayers and said, Lord, having knowledge of the hearts of all men, make clear which of these two has been marked out by you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>To take that position as a servant and Apostle, from which Judas by his sin was shut out, so that he might go to his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they put it to the decision of chance, and the decision was given for Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-57-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-64-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Till I put all those who are against you under your feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-65-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-66-2-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-67-2-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-2-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-69-2-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-70-2-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-71-2-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-72-2-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-2-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-74-2-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-75-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-76-2-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-863-23-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he had said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and a division in the meeting.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-934-25-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Festus, having had a discussion with the Jews, made answer, You have said, Let my cause come before Caesar; to Caesar you will go.</span></div>
