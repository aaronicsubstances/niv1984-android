<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons: and Joseph had come to Egypt before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Joseph came to his end, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the children of Israel were fertile, increasing very greatly in numbers and in power; and the land was full of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now a new king came to power in Egypt, who had no knowledge of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to his people, See, the people of Israel are greater in number and in power than we are:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater, and if there is a war, they may be joined with those who are against us, and make an attack on us, and go up out of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So they put overseers of forced work over them, in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work. And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more cruel they were to them, the more their number increased, till all the land was full of them. And the children of Israel were hated by the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And they gave the children of Israel even harder work to do:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And made their lives bitter with hard work, making building-material and bricks, and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth (the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah),</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the king of Egypt sent for the women, and said to them, Why have you done this, and let the male children go on living?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are strong, and the birth takes place before we come to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the blessing of God was on these women: and the people were increased in number and became very strong.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when she was no longer able to keep him secret, she made him a basket out of the stems of water-plants, pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out; and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the Nile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And opening it, she saw the child, and he was crying. And she had pity on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, May I go and get you one of the Hebrew women to give him the breast?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and got the child's mother.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now when Moses had become a man, one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was; and he saw an Egyptian giving blows to a Hebrew, one of his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And turning this way and that, and seeing no one, he put the Egyptian to death, covering his body with sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he went out the day after and saw two of the Hebrews fighting: and he said to him who was in the wrong, Why are you fighting your brother?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? are you going to put me to death as you did the Egyptian? And Moses was in fear, and said, It is clear that the thing has come to light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now when Pharaoh had news of this, he would have put Moses to death. But Moses went in flight from Pharaoh into the land of Midian: and he took his seat by a water-spring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came to get water for their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away; but Moses got up and came to their help, watering their flock for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you have come back so quickly today?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Moses was happy to go on living with the man; and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And she gave birth to a son, to whom he gave the name Gershom: for he said, I have been living in a strange land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now after a long time the king of Egypt came to his end: and the children of Israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work, and their cry for help came to the ears of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And at the sound of their weeping the agreement which God had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob came to his mind.</span></div>
