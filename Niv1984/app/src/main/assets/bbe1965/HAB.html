<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>How long, O Lord, will your ears be shut to my voice? I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do not send salvation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by evil-doers; because of which right is twisted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>See among the nations, and take note, and be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief, even if news of it is given to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They are greatly to be feared: their right comes from themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They are coming all of them with force; the direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Are you not eternal, O Lord my God, my Holy One? for you there is no death. O Lord, he has been ordered by you for our punishment; and by you, O Rock, he has been marked out to put us right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He has made men like the fishes of the sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He takes them all up with his hook, he takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for which cause he is glad and full of joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For this reason he makes an offering to his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord gave me an answer, and said, Put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones, so that the reader may go quickly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For the vision is still for the fixed time, and it is moving quickly to the end, and it will not be false: even if it is slow in coming, go on waiting for it; because it will certainly come, it will not be kept back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>As for the man of pride, my soul has no pleasure in him; but the upright man will have life through his good faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>A curse on the cruel and false one! the man full of pride, who never has enough; who makes his desires wide as the underworld! he is like death; he is never full, but he makes all nations come to him, getting all peoples together to himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him, and say, A curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you, and your troublers get up from their sleep, and you will be to them like goods taken in war?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because you have taken their goods from great nations, all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from you; because of men's blood and violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>A curse on him who gets evil profits for his family, so that he may put his resting-place on high and be safe from the hand of the wrongdoer!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You have been a cause of shame to your house by cutting off a number of peoples, and sinning against your soul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the stone will give a cry out of the wall, and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>A curse on him who is building a place with blood, and basing a town on evil-doing!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>See, is it not the pleasure of the Lord of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves up for nothing?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>A curse on him who gives his neighbour the wine of his wrath, making him overcome with strong drink from the cup of his passion, so that you may be a witness of their shame!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>You are full of shame in place of glory: take your part in the drinking, and let your shame be uncovered: the cup of the Lord's right hand will come round to you and your glory will be covered with shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the violent acts against Lebanon will come on you, and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear to you, because of men's blood and the violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>What profit is the pictured image to its maker? and as for the metal image, the false teacher, why does its maker put his faith in it, making false gods without a voice?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>A curse on him who says to the wood, Awake! to the unbreathing stone, Up! let it be a teacher! See, it is plated with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all inside it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let all the earth be quiet before him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>O Lord, word of you has come to my ears; I have seen your work, O Lord; when the years come near make it clear; in wrath keep mercy in mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear.</span></div>
