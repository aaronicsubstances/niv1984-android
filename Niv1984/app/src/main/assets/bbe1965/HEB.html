<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In times past the word of God came to our fathers through the prophets, in different parts and in different ways;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But now, at the end of these days, it has come to us through his Son, to whom he has given all things for a heritage, and through whom he made the order of the generations;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who, being the outshining of his glory, the true image of his substance, supporting all things by the word of his power, having given himself as an offering making clean from sins, took his seat at the right hand of God in heaven;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Having become by so much better than the angels, as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To which of the angels did God say at any time, You are my Son, this day I have given you being? or, I will be his Father, and he will be my Son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again, when he is sending his only Son into the world, he says, Let all the angels of God give him worship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But of the Son he says, Your seat of power, O God, is for ever and ever; and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil; and so God, your God, has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You, Lord, at the first did put the earth on its base, and the heavens are the works of your hands:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They will come to their end; but you are for ever; they will become old as a robe;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They will be rolled up like a cloth, even like a robe, and they will be changed: but you are the same and your years will have no end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But of which of the angels has he said at any time, Take your seat at my right hand till I put all those who are against you under your feet?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Are they not all helping spirits, who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?</span></div>

<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-2'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears, for fear that by chance we might be slipping away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Because if the word which came through the angels was fixed, and in the past every evil act against God's orders was given its full punishment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>What will come on us, if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation? a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord, and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And God was a witness with them, by signs and wonders, and by more than natural powers, and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come, of which I am writing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But a certain writer has given his witness, saying, What is man, that you keep him in mind? what is the son of man, that you take him into account?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You made him a little lower than the angels; you gave him a crown of glory and honour, and made him ruler over all the works of your hands:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>You put all things under his feet. For in making man the ruler over all things, God did not put anything outside his authority; though we do not see everything under him now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because it was right for him, for whom and through whom all things have being, in guiding his sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Saying, I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers, I will make a song of praise to you before the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And again he says, I will put my faith in him. And again, See, I am here, and the children which God has given to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And because the children are flesh and blood, he took a body himself and became like them; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death, that is to say, the Evil One;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death, go free.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For, truly, he does not take on the life of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this reason, holy brothers, marked out to have a part in heaven, give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses, even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Let us then, though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-64-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-65-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-66-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-67-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-69-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-70-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-71-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-72-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-74-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-115-7-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, a priest of the Most High God, who gave Abraham his blessing, meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-116-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had, being first named King of righteousness, and then in addition, King of Salem, that is to say, King of peace;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-117-7-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Being without father or mother, or family, having no birth or end to his life, being made like the Son of God, is a priest for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-118-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now see how great this man was, to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-119-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And it is true that by the law, those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods; that is to say, they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-120-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But this man, who was not of their family, took the tenth from Abraham, and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-121-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-122-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now at the present time, men over whom death has power take the tenth; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-123-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And we may say that in Abraham, even Levi, who has a right to take the tenth part, gave it;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-124-7-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-125-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi (for the law was given to the people in connection with them), what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-126-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Because if the priests are changed, it is necessary to make a change in the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-127-7-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe, of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-128-7-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-129-7-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-130-7-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>That is to say, not made by a law based on the flesh, but by the power of a life without end:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-131-7-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For it has been witnessed of him, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-132-7-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So the law which went before is put on one side, because it was feeble and without profit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-133-7-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>(Because the law made nothing complete), and in its place there is a better hope, through which we come near to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-134-7-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And as this is not without the taking of an oath</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-135-7-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>(For those were made priests without an oath, but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him, The Lord gave his oath, which he will not take back, that you are a priest for ever);</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-136-7-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-137-7-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests, because death does not let them go on for ever;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-138-7-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But this priest, because his life goes on for ever, is unchanging.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-139-7-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him, because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-140-7-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>It was right for us to have such a high priest, one who is holy and without evil, doing no wrong, having no part with sinners, and made higher than the heavens:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-141-7-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day, like those high priests, first for himself, and then for the people; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-142-7-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The law makes high priests of men who are feeble; but the word of the oath, which was made after the law, gives that position to a Son, in whom all good is for ever complete.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-145-8-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-146-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-147-8-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-148-8-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-149-8-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-150-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-151-8-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-152-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-153-8-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-154-8-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-155-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-156-8-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-157-8-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-160-9-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-161-9-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-162-9-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-163-9-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-164-9-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-165-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-166-9-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-167-9-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-168-9-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-169-9-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-170-9-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-171-9-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-172-9-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-173-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-174-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-175-9-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-177-9-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So that even the first agreement was not made without blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-178-9-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-179-9-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-180-9-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-181-9-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-182-9-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-183-9-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-184-9-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-185-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-186-9-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And because by God's law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-187-9-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation.</span></div>
