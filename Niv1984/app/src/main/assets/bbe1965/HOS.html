<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word of the Lord which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The start of the word of the Lord by Hosea: And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take for yourself a wife of loose ways, and children of the same, for the land has been untrue to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So he took as his wife Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she gave birth to a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Lord said to him, Give him the name of Jezreel, for after a little time I will send punishment for the blood of Jezreel on the line of Jehu, and put an end to the kingdom of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And in that day I will let the bow of Israel be broken in the valley of Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And after that she gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said, Give her the name Lo-ruhamah; for I will not again have mercy on Israel, to give them forgiveness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But I will have mercy on Judah and will give them salvation by the Lord their God, but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now when Lo-ruhamah had been taken from the breast, the woman gave birth to a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the Lord said, Give him the name Lo-ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But still the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which may not be measured or numbered; and in place of its being said to them, You are not my people, it will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together and take for themselves one head, and will go up from the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-216-14-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>O Israel, come back to the Lord your God; for your evil-doing has been the cause of your fall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-217-14-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Take with you words, and come back to the Lord; say to him, Let there be forgiveness for all wrongdoing, so that we may take what is good, and give in payment the fruit of our lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-218-14-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Assyria will not be our salvation; we will not go on horses; we will not again say to the work of our hands, You are our gods; for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-219-14-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I will put right their errors; freely will my love be given to them, for my wrath is turned away from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-220-14-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I will be as the dew to Israel; he will put out flowers like a lily, and send out his roots like Lebanon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-221-14-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>His branches will be stretched out, he will be beautiful as the olive-tree and sweet-smelling as Lebanon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-222-14-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They will come back and have rest in his shade; their life will be made new like the grain, and they will put out flowers like the vine; his name will be like the wine of Lebanon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-223-14-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As for Ephraim, what has he to do with false gods any longer? I have given an answer and I will keep watch over him; I am like a branching fir-tree, from me comes your fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-224-14-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He who is wise will see these things; he who has good sense will have knowledge of them. For the ways of the Lord are straight, and the upright will go in them, but sinners will be falling in them.</span></div>
