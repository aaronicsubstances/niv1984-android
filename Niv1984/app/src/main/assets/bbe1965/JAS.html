<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Let it be all joy to you, my brothers, when you undergo tests of every sort;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But let this power have its full effect, so that you may be made complete, needing nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if any man among you is without wisdom, let him make his request to God, who gives freely to all without an unkind word, and it will be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For there is a division in his mind, and he is uncertain in all his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the man of wealth, that he is made low; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For when the sun comes up with its burning heat, the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing; because, if he has God's approval, he will be given the crown of life, which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Let no man say when he is tested, I am tested by God; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil, and he himself puts no man to such a test:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then when its time comes, desire gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is of full growth, gives birth to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Do not be turned from the right way, dear brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven, coming from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Of his purpose he gave us being, by his true word, so that we might be, in a sense, the first-fruits of all the things which he had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You have knowledge of this, dear brothers. But let every man be quick in hearing, slow in words, slow to get angry;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For this reason, putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil, take into your souls without pride the word which, being planted there, is able to give you salvation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers of it, blinding yourselves with false ideas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For after looking at himself he goes away, and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free, being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect, this man will have a blessing on his acts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false, this man's religion is of no value.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this: to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble, and to keep oneself untouched by the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have put the poor man to shame. Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You have the belief that God is one, and you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way?</span></div>
