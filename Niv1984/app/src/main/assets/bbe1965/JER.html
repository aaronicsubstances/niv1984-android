<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his rule.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And it came again in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, up to the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah; till Jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Before you were formed in the body of your mother I had knowledge of you, and before your birth I made you holy; I have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then said I, O Lord God! see, I have no power of words, for I am a child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But the Lord said to me, Do not say, I am a child: for wherever I send you, you are to go, and whatever I give you orders to say, you are to say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Have no fear because of them: for I am with you, to keep you safe, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then the Lord put out his hand, touching my mouth; and the Lord said to me, See, I have put my words in your mouth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>See, this day I have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms, for uprooting and smashing down, for destruction and overturning, for building up and planting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a branch of an almond-tree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the Lord said to me, You have seen well: for I keep watch over my word to give effect to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the north.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the Lord said to me, Out of the north evil will come, bursting out on all the people of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For see, I will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord; and they will come, everyone placing his high seat at the way into Jerusalem, and against its walls on every side, and against all the towns of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I will give my decision against them on account of all their evil-doing; because they have given me up, burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So make yourself ready, and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say: do not be overcome by fear of them, or I will send fear on you before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For see, this day have I made you a walled town, and an iron pillar, and walls of brass, against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its captains, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you, says the Lord, to give you salvation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Israel was holy to the Lord, the first-fruits of his increase: all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers, evil came on them, says the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And they never said, Where is the Lord, who took us up out of the land of Egypt; who was our guide through the waste of sand, through an unplanted land full of deep holes, through a dry land of deep shade, which no one went through and where no man was living?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And I took you into a fertile land, where you were living on its fruit and its wealth; but when you came in, you made my land unclean, and made my heritage a disgusting thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The priests did not say, Where is the Lord? and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me: and the rulers did evil against me, and the prophets became prophets of the Baal, going after things without value.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For this reason, I will again put forward my cause against you, says the Lord, even against you and against your children's children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For go over to the sea-lands of Kittim and see; send to Kedar and give deep thought to it; and see if there has ever been such a thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Has any nation ever made a change in their gods, though they are no gods? but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For my people have done two evils; they have given up me, the fountain of living waters, and have made for themselves water-holes, cut out from the rock, broken water-holes, of no use for storing water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Is Israel a servant? has he been a house-servant from birth? why has he been made waste?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The young lions have made an outcry against him with a loud voice: they have made his land waste; his towns are burned up, with no one living in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Even the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have put shame on you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Has not this come on you because you have given up the Lord your God, who was your guide by the way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And now, what have you to do on the way to Egypt, to get your drink from the waters of the Nile? or what have you to do on the way to Assyria, to get your drink from the waters of the River?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For in the past, your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted; and you said, I will not be your servant; for on every high hill and under every branching tree, your behaviour was like that of a loose woman</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But when you were planted by me, you were a noble vine, in every way a true seed: how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For even if you are washed with soda and take much soap, still your evil-doing is marked before me, says the Lord God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>How are you able to say, I am not unclean, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, be clear about what you have done: you are a quick-footed camel twisting her way in and out;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>An untrained ass, used to the waste land, breathing up the wind in her desire; at her time, who is able to send her away? all those who are looking for her will have no need to make themselves tired; in her month they will get her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Do not let your foot be without shoes, or your throat dry from need of water: but you said, There is no hope: no, for I have been a lover of strange gods, and after them I will go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>As the thief is shamed when he is taken, so is Israel shamed; they, their kings and their rulers, their priests and their prophets;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Who say to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You have given me life: for their backs have been turned to me, not their faces: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Up! and be our saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But where are the gods you have made for yourselves? let them come, if they are able to give you salvation in the time of your trouble: for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns, O Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Why will you put forward your cause against me? You have all done evil against me, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>I gave your children blows to no purpose; they got no good from training: your sword has been the destruction of your prophets, like a death-giving lion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-53-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>O generation, see the word of the Lord. Have I been a waste land to Israel? or a land of dark night? why do my people say, We have got loose, we will not come to you again?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-54-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments, or a bride her robes? but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Why do you go about so much for the purpose of changing your way? you will be shamed on account of Egypt, as you were shamed on account of Assyria.</span></div>
