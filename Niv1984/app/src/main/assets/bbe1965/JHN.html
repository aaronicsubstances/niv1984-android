<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>All things came into existence through him, and without him nothing was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>What came into existence in him was life, and the life was the light of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the light goes on shining in the dark; it is not overcome by the dark.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He came for witness, to give witness about the light, so that all men might have faith through him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He himself was not the light: he was sent to give witness about the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The true light, which gives light to every man, was then coming into the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He was in the world, the world which came into being through him, but the world had no knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>To all those who did so take him, however, he gave the right of becoming children of God--that is, to those who had faith in his name:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Whose birth was from God and not from blood, or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time; and we saw his glory--such glory as is given to an only son by his father--saw it to be true and full of grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>John gave witness about him, crying, This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the law was given through Moses; grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>No man has seen God at any time; the only Son, who is on the breast of the Father, he has made clear what God is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question, Who are you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He said quite openly and straightforwardly, I am not the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they said to him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And his answer was, I am not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the waste land, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they put this question to him, saying, Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ, or Elijah, or the prophet?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>John's answer was: I give baptism with water; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>It is he who is coming after me; I am not good enough to undo his shoes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was giving baptism.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The day after, John sees Jesus coming to him and says, See, here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>This is he of whom I said, One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>I myself had no knowledge of him, but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And John gave this witness, saying, I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>I had no knowledge who he was, but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting, it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The day after, John was there again with two of his disciples;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said, See, there is the Lamb of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Hearing what he said, the two disciples went after Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Jesus, turning round, saw them coming after him and said to them, What are you looking for? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, Master), where are you living?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He said to them, Come and see. They went with him then and saw where he was living; and they were with him all that day: it was then about the tenth hour of the day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two men who, hearing what John said, went after Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him, We have made discovery! It is the Messiah! (which is to say, the Christ).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he took him to Jesus. Looking at him fixedly Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; your name will be Cephas (which is to say, Peter).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>The day after this, Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee. He came across Philip and said to him, Come and be my disciple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Now Philip's town was Beth-saida, where Andrew and Peter came from.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Philip came across Nathanael and said to him, We have made a discovery! It is he of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets were writing, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Nazareth! said Nathanael, Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, See, here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-49-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Nathanael said to him, Where did you get knowledge of me? In answer Jesus said, Before Philip was talking with you, while you were still under the fig-tree, I saw you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-50-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Nathanael said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>In answer Jesus said to him, You have faith because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree. You will see greater things than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-52-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And he said to him, Truly I say to you all, You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-55-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-56-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Jesus with his disciples came as guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-57-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When they had not enough wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-59-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-60-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now six pots of stone, every one taking two or three firkins of water, were placed there for the purpose of washing, as is the way of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-61-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus said to the servants, Make the pots full of water. And they made them full to the top.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-62-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then he said to them, Now take some, and give it to the master of the feast. So they took it to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-63-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>After tasting the water which had now become wine, the master of the feast (having no idea where it came from, though it was clear to the servants who took the water out) sent for the newly-married man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-64-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And said to him, Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-65-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly; and his disciples put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-66-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-67-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-68-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-69-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple, with the sheep and the oxen, sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-70-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And to those who were trading in doves he said, Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a market.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-71-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say, I am on fire with passion for your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-72-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the Jews put this question to him: What sign of authority have you to give us, seeing that you do these things?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Jesus said to them, Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-74-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The Jews said, The building of this Temple took forty-six years; and you will put it up in three days!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-75-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But his words were about that holy building which was his body.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-77-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-78-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But Jesus did not have faith in them, because he had knowledge of them all.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-120-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-121-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>(Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-122-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-123-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-124-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-125-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-139-4-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-140-4-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-141-4-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-142-4-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-143-4-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-144-4-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-145-4-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-146-4-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-147-4-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-148-4-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-149-4-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So they went out of the town and came to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-150-4-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-151-4-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-152-4-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-153-4-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-154-4-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-155-4-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-156-4-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-157-4-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-158-4-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-159-4-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-160-4-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-161-4-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-162-4-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-163-4-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-164-4-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-165-4-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-166-4-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-167-4-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-168-4-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-169-4-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-170-4-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-171-4-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-172-4-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-173-4-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-182-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-183-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-193-5-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death, because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father, so making himself equal with God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-560-12-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-561-12-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So they made him a meal there, and he was waited on by Martha, and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-562-12-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Mary, taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value, put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair: and the house became full of the smell of the perfume.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-563-12-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-564-12-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence, and the money given to the poor?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-565-12-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>(He said this, not because he had any love for the poor; but because he was a thief, and, having the money-bag, took for himself what was put into it.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-566-12-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Jesus said, Let her be. Let her keep what she has for the day of my death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-568-12-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there: and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-569-12-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-570-12-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-571-12-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-572-12-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-573-12-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it; as the Writings say,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-574-12-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Have no fear, daughter of Zion: see your King is coming, seated on a young ass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-575-12-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>(These things were not clear to his disciples at first: but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory, then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-576-12-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead, and gave him life again, had been talking about it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-577-12-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And that was the reason the people went out to him, because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-578-12-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the Pharisees said one to another, You see, you are unable to do anything: the world has gone after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-579-12-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-580-12-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They came to Philip, who was of Beth-saida in Galilee, and made a request, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-581-12-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-582-12-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Jesus said to them in answer, The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-583-12-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Truly I say to you, If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end, it is still a seed and no more; but through its death it gives much fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-584-12-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He who is in love with life will have it taken from him; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-585-12-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If any man is my servant, let him come after me; and where I am, there will my servant be. If any man becomes my servant, my Father will give him honour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-586-12-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Now is my soul troubled; and what am I to say? Father, keep me from this hour. No: for this purpose have I come to this hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-587-12-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Father, give glory to your name. Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-588-12-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-589-12-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus said in answer, This voice came not for me but for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-590-12-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now is this world to be judged: now will the ruler of this world be sent out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-591-12-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will make all men come to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-592-12-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>(This he said, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-593-12-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then the people in answer said to him, The law says that the Christ will have life without end: how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-594-12-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, For a little time longer the light will be among you; while you have the light go on walking in it, so that the dark may not overtake you: one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-595-12-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-596-12-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But though he had done such a number of signs before them, they still had no belief in him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-597-12-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true, when he said, Lord, who has any belief in our preaching? and the arm of the Lord, to whom has it been unveiled?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-598-12-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>For this reason they were unable to have belief, because Isaiah said again,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-599-12-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>He has made their eyes blind, and their hearts hard; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts, and be changed, and I might make them well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-600-12-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>(Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory. His words were about him.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-601-12-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>However, a number even of the rulers had belief in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-602-12-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-603-12-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Then Jesus said with a loud voice, He who has faith in me, has faith not in me, but in him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-604-12-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And he who sees me, sees him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-605-12-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-606-12-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them, I am not his judge: I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-607-12-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart, is not without a judge: the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-608-12-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-609-12-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-612-13-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now before the feast of the Passover, it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-613-13-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So while a meal was going on, the Evil One having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to be false to him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-617-13-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So he came to Simon Peter. Peter said, Lord, are my feet to be washed by you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-618-13-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Jesus, answering, said to him, What I do is not clear to you now, but it will be clear to you in time to come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-638-13-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him. Then Jesus said to him, Do quickly what you have to do.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-777-18-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden, into which he went with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-778-18-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Judas, who was false to him, had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-779-18-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Judas, getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees, went there with lights and with arms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-780-18-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Jesus, having knowledge of everything which was coming on him, went forward and said to them, Who are you looking for?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-781-18-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Their answer was, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said, I am he. And Judas, who was false to him, was there at their side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-782-18-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when he said to them, I am he, they went back, falling to the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-783-18-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So again he put the question to them, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-784-18-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jesus made answer, I have said that I am he; if you are looking for me, let these men go away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-785-18-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>(He said this so that his words might come true, I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-786-18-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, took it out and gave the high priest's servant a blow, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-787-18-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to Peter, Put back your sword: am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-788-18-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-789-18-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-790-18-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-791-18-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple. Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-792-18-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But Peter was kept outside at the door. Then this other disciple, who was a friend of the high priest, came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door, and took Peter in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-793-18-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter, Are you not one of this man's disciples? In answer he said, I am not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-794-18-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them, warming himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-795-18-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-796-18-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Jesus made answer, I said things openly to the world at all times; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come; and I have said nothing secretly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-797-18-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-798-18-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When he said this, one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand, saying, Do you give such an answer to the high priest?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-799-18-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jesus said in answer, If I have said anything evil, give witness to the evil: but if I said what is true, why do you give me blows?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-800-18-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas, the high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-801-18-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire. They said to him, Are you not one of his disciples? He said, No, I am not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-802-18-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>One of the servants of the high priest, a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter, said, Did I not see you with him in the garden?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-803-18-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then again Peter said, No. And straight away a cock gave its cry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-804-18-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not go into the Praetorium, so that they might not become unclean, but might take the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-805-18-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So Pilate came out to them and put the question: What have you to say against this man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-806-18-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They said to him in answer, If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-807-18-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-808-18-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>(That the word of Jesus might come true, pointing to the sort of death he would have.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-809-18-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-810-18-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus made answer, Do you say this of yourself, or did others say it about me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-811-18-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-812-18-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Jesus said in answer, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom was of this world, my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews: but my kingdom is not here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-813-18-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then Pilate said to him, Are you then a king? Jesus made answer, You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I given birth, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might give witness to what is true. Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-814-18-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Pilate said to him, True? what is true? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, I see no wrong in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-815-18-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover. Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-816-18-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then again they gave a loud cry, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was an outlaw.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-819-19-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-820-19-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-821-19-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they kept coming and saying, Long life to the King of the Jews! And they gave him blows with their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-822-19-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-823-19-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Here is the man!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-824-19-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry, To the cross! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and put him on the cross: I see no crime in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-825-19-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-826-19-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-827-19-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-828-19-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Pilate said to him, You say nothing to me? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-829-19-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-830-19-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-831-19-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-832-19-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>(It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-833-19-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then they gave a loud cry, Away with him! away with him! to the cross! Pilate said to them, Am I to put your King to death on the cross? The chief priests said in answer, We have no king but Caesar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-834-19-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-835-19-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-836-19-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Where they put him on the cross with two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus in the middle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-837-19-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing. The writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-838-19-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-839-19-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-840-19-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-841-19-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-842-19-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they put to the decision of chance.) This was what the men of the army did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-843-19-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-844-19-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-845-19-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-846-19-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-847-19-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-848-19-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-849-19-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-850-19-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-851-19-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-852-19-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-853-19-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-854-19-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-855-19-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-856-19-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-857-19-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-858-19-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-859-19-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-860-19-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-896-21-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and it came about in this way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-897-21-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Simon Peter, Thomas named Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were all together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-898-21-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, And we will come with you. They went out and got into the boat; but that night they took no fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-899-21-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea (though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-900-21-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Jesus said to them, Children, have you taken any fish? They made answer, No.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-901-21-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he said to them, Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some. So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-902-21-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter, It is the Lord! Hearing that it was the Lord, Peter put his coat round him (because he was not clothed) and went into the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-903-21-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-904-21-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When they got to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish cooking on it, and bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-905-21-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-906-21-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there was such a number the net was not broken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-907-21-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, Come and take some food. And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question, Who are you? being conscious that it was the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-908-21-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish in the same way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-909-21-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-910-21-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-911-21-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Again, a second time, he said to him, Simon, son of John, have you any love for me? Yes, Lord, he said, you are certain of my love for you. Then take care of my sheep, said Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-912-21-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He said to him a third time, Simon, son of John, am I dear to you? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time, Am I dear to you? And he said to him, Lord, you have knowledge of all things; you see that you are dear to me. Jesus said to him, Then give my sheep food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-913-21-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-914-21-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-915-21-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Peter, turning round, saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal, and said, Lord, who is it who will be false to you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-916-21-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, What about this man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-917-21-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Jesus said to him, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you? come yourself after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-918-21-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death: Jesus, however, did not say that he would not undergo death, but, If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back, what is that to you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-919-21-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing: and we have knowledge that his witness is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-920-21-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.</span></div>
