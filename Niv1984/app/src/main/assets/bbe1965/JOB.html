<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he had seven sons and three daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand camels, and a thousand oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great number of servants.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His sons regularly went to one another's houses, and every one on his day gave a feast: and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And at the end of their days of feasting, Job sent and made them clean, getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all. For, Job said, It may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of God in their hearts. And Job did this whenever the feasts came round.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the Lord, and the Satan came with them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the Lord said to the Satan, Have you taken note of my servant Job, for there is no one like him on the earth, a man without sin and upright, fearing God and keeping himself far from evil?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the Satan said in answer to the Lord, Is it for nothing that Job is a god-fearing man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side, blessing the work of his hands, and increasing his cattle in the land?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The fire of God came down from heaven, burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, The Chaldaeans made themselves into three bands, and came down on the camels and took them away, putting the young men to the sword, and I was the only one who got away safe to give you the news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this one was still talking when another came, and said, Your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brother's house,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Job got up, and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair, he went down on his face to the earth, and gave worship, and said,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he took a broken bit of a pot, and, seated in the dust, was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Job's three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And lifting up their eyes when they were still far off, it did not seem that the man they saw was Job because of the change in him.
