<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the word of the Lord came to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' helper, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Moses my servant is dead; so now get up! Go over Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Every place on which you put your foot I have given to you, as I said to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>From the waste land and this mountain Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea, in the west, will be your country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>While you are living, all will give way before you: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not take away my help from you or give you up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Take heart and be strong; for you will give to this people for their heritage the land which I gave by an oath to their fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Only take heart and be very strong; take care to do all the law which Moses my servant gave you, not turning from it to the right hand or to the left, so that you may do well in all your undertakings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Let this book of the law be ever on your lips and in your thoughts day and night, so that you may keep with care everything in it; then a blessing will be on all your way, and you will do well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Have I not given you your orders? Take heart and be strong; have no fear and do not be troubled; for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Joshua gave their orders to those who were in authority over the people, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Go through the tents and give orders to the people, saying, Get ready a store of food; for in three days you are to go over this river Jordan and take for your heritage the land which the Lord your God is giving you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Keep in mind what Moses, the servant of the Lord, said to you, The Lord your God is sending you rest and will give you this land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle will be kept here in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but you, the fighting-men, are to go over before your brothers, armed, to give them help;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Till the Lord has given your brothers rest, as he has given it to you, and they have taken their heritage in the land which the Lord your God is giving them: then you will go back to the land of your heritage which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you on the east side of Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then they said to Joshua in answer, Whatever you say to us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men from Shittim secretly, with the purpose of searching out the land, and Jericho.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And it was said to the king of Jericho, See, some men have come here tonight from the children of Israel with the purpose of searching out the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Send out the men who have come to you and are in your house; for they have come with the purpose of searching out all the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the woman took the two men and put them in a secret place; then she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I had no idea where they came from;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when it was the time for shutting the doors at dark, they went out; I have no idea where the men went: but if you go after them quickly, you will overtake them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But she had taken them up to the roof, covering them with the stems of flax which she had put out in order there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So the men went after them on the road to Jordan as far as the river-crossing: and when they had gone out after them, the door into the town was shut.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And before the men went to rest, she came up to them on the roof,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And said to them, It is clear to me that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has come on us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For we have had news of how the Lord made the Red Sea dry before you when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you gave up to the curse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And because of this news, our hearts became like water, and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you; for the Lord your God is God in heaven on high and here on earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So now, will you give me your oath by the Lord, that, because I have been kind to you, you will be kind to my father's house,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the men said to her, Our life for yours if you keep our business secret; and when the Lord has given us the land, we will keep faith and be kind to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then she let them down from the window by a cord, for the house where she was living was on the town wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she said to them, Get away into the hill-country, or the men who have gone after you will overtake you; keep yourselves safe there for three days, till the searchers have come back, and then go on your way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the men said to her, We will only be responsible for this oath which you have made us take,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But if you say anything about our business here, then we will be free from the oath you have made us take.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she said, Let it be as you say. Then she sent them away, and they went; and she put the bright red cord in the window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And they went into the hill-country and were there three days, till the men who had gone after them had come back; and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then the two men came down from the hill-country and went over and came back to Joshua, the son of Nun; and they gave him a complete account of what had taken place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they said to Joshua, Truly, the Lord has given all the land into our hands; and all the people of the land have become like water because of us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-58-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>See, the ark of the agreement of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into Jordan.</span></div>
