<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold, perfume, and spices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-51-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-656-19-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came about that after saying these words, Jesus went away from Galilee, and came into the parts of Judaea on the other side of Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-657-19-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And a great number went after him; and he made them well there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-658-19-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And certain Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-662-19-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They say to him, Why then did Moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-663-19-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He says to them, Moses, because of your hard hearts, let you put away your wives: but it has not been so from the first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-664-19-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I say to you, Whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue, and takes another, is a false husband: and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away, is no true husband to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-665-19-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The disciples say to him, If this is the position of a man in relation to his wife, it is better not to be married.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-668-19-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then some people took little children to him, so that he might put his hands on them in blessing: and the disciples said sharp words to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-669-19-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Jesus said, Let the little ones come to me, and do not keep them away: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-682-19-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then Peter said to him, See, we have given up everything and have come after you; what then will we have?</span></div>
