<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The history of Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. Now it came about, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, when I was in Shushan, the king's town,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>That Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah; and in answer to my request for news of the Jews who had been prisoners and had got away, and of Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They said to me, The small band of Jews now living there in the land are in great trouble and shame: the wall of Jerusalem has been broken down, and its doorways burned with fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then, after hearing these words, for some days I gave myself up to weeping and sorrow, seated on the earth; and taking no food I made prayer to the God of heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And said, O Lord, the God of heaven, the great God, greatly to be feared, keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open, so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant, which I make before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel, your servants, while I put before you the sins of the children of Israel, which we have done against you: truly, I and my father's people are sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We have done great wrong against you, and have not kept the orders, the rules, and the decisions, which you gave to your servant Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Keep in mind, O Lord, the order you gave your servant Moses, saying, If you do wrong I will send you wandering among the peoples:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if you come back to me and keep my orders and do them, even if those of you who have been forced out are living in the farthest parts of heaven, I will get them from there, and take them back to the place marked out by me for the resting-place of my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>O Lord, let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant, and of the prayers of your servants, who take delight in worshipping your name: give help, O Lord, to your servant this day, and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man.

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before been sad when the king was present.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, seeing that you are not ill? this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was full of fear;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And said to the king, May the king be living for ever: is it not natural for my face to be sad, when the town, the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, has been made waste and its doorways burned with fire?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king said to me, What is your desire? So I made prayer to the God of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I said to the king, If it is the king's pleasure, and if your servant has your approval, send me to Judah, to the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest, so that I may take in hand the building of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the king said to me (the queen being seated by his side), How long will your journey take, and when will you come back? So the king was pleased to send me, and I gave him a fixed time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Further, I said to the king, If it is the king's pleasure, let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river, so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's park, so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house, and for the wall of the town, and for the house which is to be mine. And the king gave me this, for the hand of my God was on me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then I came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, hearing of it, were greatly troubled because a man had come to the help of the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And in the night I got up, taking with me a small band of men; I said nothing to any man of what God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem: and I had no beast with me but the one on which I was seated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And I went out by night, through the doorway of the valley, and past the dragon's water-spring as far as the place where waste material was put, viewing the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and the doorways which had been burned with fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then I went on to the door of the fountain and to the king's pool: but there was no room for my beast to get through.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then in the night, I went up by the stream, viewing the wall; then turning back, I went in by the door in the valley, and so came back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the chiefs had no knowledge of where I had been or what I was doing; and I had not then said anything to the Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then I said to them, You see what a bad condition we are in; how Jerusalem is a waste, and its doorways burned with fire: come, let us get to work, building up the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be put to shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then I gave them an account of how the hand of my God was on me, helping me; and of the king's words which he had said to me. And they said, Let us get to work on the building. So they made their hands strong for the good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, hearing of it, made sport of us, laughing at us and saying, What are you doing? will you go against the king?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then answering them I said, The God of heaven, he will be our help; so we his servants will go on with our building: but you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-73-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Such is their building that if a fox goes up it, their stone wall will be broken down.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-406-13-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went to the king; and after some days, I got the king to let me go,</span></div>
