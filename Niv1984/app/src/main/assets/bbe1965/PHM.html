<h2 id='bbe1965-bookmark-1-1'>Philemon</h2>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.</span></div>
