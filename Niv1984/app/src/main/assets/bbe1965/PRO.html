<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil.</span></div>
