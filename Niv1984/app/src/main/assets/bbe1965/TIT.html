<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in agreement with the faith of the saints of God and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In the hope of eternal life, which was made certain before eternal time, by the word of God who is ever true;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who, in his time, made clear his word in the good news, of which, by the order of God our Saviour, I became a preacher;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I did not take you with me when I went away from Crete, so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there, placing men in authority over the churches in every town, as I said to you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Men having a good record, husbands of one wife, whose children are of the faith, children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For it is necessary for a Bishop to be a man of virtue, as God's servant; not pushing himself forward, not quickly moved to wrath or blows, not desiring profit for himself;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But opening his house freely to guests; a lover of what is good, serious-minded, upright, holy, self-controlled;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Keeping to the true word of the teaching, so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are men who are not ruled by law; foolish talkers, false teachers, specially those of the circumcision,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>By whom some families have been completely overturned; who take money for teaching things which are not right; these will have to be stopped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>One of their prophets has said, The men of Crete are ever false, evil beasts, lovers of food, hating work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This witness is true. So say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Giving no attention to the fictions of the Jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>To the clean in heart all things are clean: but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean; they become unclean in mind and in thought.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They say that they have knowledge of God, while by their acts they are turning their backs on him; they are hated by all, hard-hearted, and judged to be without value for any good work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>That old women are to be self-respecting in behaviour, not saying evil of others, not given to taking much wine, teachers of that which is good,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To be wise in mind, clean in heart, kind; working in their houses, living under the authority of their husbands; so that no evil may be said of the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>To the young men give orders to be wise and serious-minded:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In all things see that you are an example of good works; holy in your teaching, serious in behaviour,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Saying true and right words, against which no protest may be made, so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame, unable to say any evil of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Servants are to be under the authority of their masters, pleasing them in all things, without argument;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Not taking what is not theirs, but giving clear signs of their good faith, in all things doing credit to the teaching of God our Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the grace of God has come, giving salvation to all men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Training us so that, turning away from evil and the desires of this world, we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of God in this present life;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Looking for the glad hope, the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who gave himself for us, so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing, and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>On all these points give teaching and help, and make clear what is right with all authority. Let all men give you honour.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-37-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities, to do what they are ordered, to be ready for every good work,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-38-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To say no evil of any man, not to be fighters, to give way to others, to be gentle in behaviour to all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-39-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For in the past we were foolish, hard in heart, turned from the true way, servants of evil desires and pleasures, living in bad feeling and envy, hated and hating one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-40-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when the mercy of God our Saviour, and his love to man was seen,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>This is a true saying; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things, so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works. These things are good and of profit to men;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But have nothing to do with foolish questionings, and lists of generations, and fights and arguments about the law; for they are of no profit and foolish.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Clearly he is in error and a sinner, being self-judged.</span></div>
