<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I will take away everything from the face of the earth, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I will take away man and beast; I will take away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea; causing the downfall of the evil-doers, and cutting man off from the face of the earth, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And my hand will be stretched out on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem, cutting off the name of the Baal from this place, and the name of the false priests,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the worshippers of the army of heaven on the house-tops, and the Lord's worshippers who take oaths by Milcom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And those who are turned back from going after the Lord, and those who have not made prayer to the Lord or got directions from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Let there be no sound before the Lord God: for the day of the Lord is near: for the Lord has made ready an offering, he has made his guests holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And it will come about in the day of the Lord's offering, that I will send punishment on the rulers and the king's sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And in that day I will send punishment on all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their master's house full of violent behaviour and deceit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And in that day, says the Lord, there will be the sound of a cry from the fish doorway, and an outcry from the new town, and a great thundering from the hills, and cries of grief from the people of the Hollow;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Because of the downfall of all the people of Canaan: all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And it will come about at that time, that I will go searching through Jerusalem with lights; and I will send punishment on the men who have become like wine stored over-long, who say to themselves, The Lord will not do good and will not do evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And their wealth will be violently taken away, and their houses will be made waste: they will go on building houses and never living in them, and planting vine-gardens but not drinking the wine from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and coming very quickly; the bitter day of the Lord is near, coming on more quickly than a man of war.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and sorrow, a day of wasting and destruction, a day of dark night and deep shade, a day of cloud and thick dark.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>A day of sounding the horn and the war-cry against the walled towns and the high towers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And I will send trouble on men so that they will go about like the blind, because they have done evil against the Lord: and their blood will be drained out like dust, and their strength like waste.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Even their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the Lord's wrath; but all the land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath: for he will put an end, even suddenly, to all who are living in the land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Come together, make everyone come together, O nation without shame;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Before the Lord sends you violently away in flight like the waste from the grain; before the burning wrath of the Lord comes on you, before the day of the Lord's wrath comes on you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Make search for the Lord, all you quiet ones of the earth, who have done what is right in his eyes; make search for righteousness and a quiet heart: it may be that you will be safely covered in the day of the Lord's wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For Gaza will be given up and Ashkelon will become waste: they will send Ashdod out in the middle of the day, and Ekron will be uprooted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Sorrow to the people living by the sea, the nation of the Cherethites!

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the land by the sea will be grass-land, with houses for keepers of sheep and walled places for flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The land by the sea will be for the rest of the children of Judah; by the sea they will give their flocks food: in the houses of Ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening; for the Lord their God will take them in hand and their fate will be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>My ears have been open to the bitter words of Moab and the words of shame of the children of Ammon, which they have said against my people, lifting themselves up against the limit of their land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For this cause, by my life, says the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, truly Moab will become like Sodom and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah, given up to waste plants and salt pools and unpeopled for ever: the rest of my people will take their property, the overflow of my nation will take their heritage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>This will be their fate because of their pride, because they have said evil, lifting themselves up against the people of the Lord of armies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The Lord will let himself be seen by them: for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble; and men will go down before him in worship, everyone from his place, even all the sea-lands of the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And you Ethiopians will be put to death by my sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-34-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And his hand will be stretched out against the north, for the destruction of Assyria; and he will make Nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And herds will take their rest in the middle of her, all the beasts of the valley: the pelican and the porcupine will make their living-places on the tops of its pillars; the owl will be crying in the window; the raven will be seen on the doorstep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>This is the town which was full of joy, living without fear of danger, saying in her heart, I am, and there is no other: how has she been made waste, a place for beasts to take their rest in! everyone who goes by her will make hisses, waving his hand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-42-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Her prophets are good-for-nothing persons, full of deceit: her priests have made the holy place unclean and have gone violently against the law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-44-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I have had the nations cut off, their towers are broken down; I have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them: destruction has overtaken their towns, so that there is no man living in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-45-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I said, Certainly you will go in fear of me, and come under my training, so that whatever I may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes: but they got up early and made all their works evil.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='bbe1965-bookmark-47-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For then I will give the people a clean language, so that they may all make prayer to the Lord and be his servants with one mind.</span></div>
