<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The phrase ‘masculorum concubitoribus’ refers to homosexuality; the word ‘concubitoribus’ is masculine plural, and the word ‘masculorum’ refers to males generally. Since Paul adds ‘whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine’ female homosexuality is also condemned.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Paul is not saying that he is literally the worst sinner of all, but merely that he was among the worst sinners; ‘first’ is used as a superlative in the general sense of ‘very much so,’ and not in the absolute sense of ‘more so than any other.’</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘verecundia’ does not simply mean ‘modesty.’ It often means shame, but in this context, it is more of the meaning of recoiling from anything that would be shameful. Compunction expresses this meaning in English fairly well, referring to an exercise of conscience occasioned by the prospect of wrongdoing. The word ‘sobrietate’ in this context does not refer to restraint in drinking, nor in thinking, but to restraint in the manner of dressing and grooming.</span></div>

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-62-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The expression ‘husband of one wife’ has an idiomatic meaning, that he be a devoted husband; the literal meaning also applies, he should not be a man who has married more than once. In the early Church, many Church leaders had converted during their adult life, so many were already married; thus, it was necessary to permit a married man to be a Bishop. Very soon in the history of the Church, the Holy Spirit wisely guided the faithful to prefer celibate men for the Episcopate.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘modestum’ in Latin has a broader range of meaning than the word ‘modesty’ in English. Often, the word ‘modestum’ does mean modesty, but in the context of this phrase (‘non percussorem, sed modestum’), it has the broader meaning of self-restraint in general.</span></div>
