<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For when the commander himself was in Persia, and with him an immense army, he fell in the temple of Nanea, having been deceived by the counsel of the priests of Nanea.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the priests of Nanea had made the proposal, and he had entered with a few men into the vestibule of the shrine, they closed the temple,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Blessed be God through all things, who has delivered up the impious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore, establishing the purification of the temple on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Kislev, we considered it necessary to signify this to you, so that you, likewise, may keep the day of shelters, and the day of the fire that was given when Nehemiah offered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar had been built.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests, who at that time were worshippers of God, secretly took the fire from the altar, and they kept it hidden in a valley, where there was a deep and dry pit, and they kept it safe in that place, in such a way that the place would be unknown to all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemiah should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests who had hidden it to seek the fire. And, just as they told us, they did not find fire, but only deep water.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-4" id="cpdv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he ordered them to draw it up and to carry it to him. And the priest, Nehemiah, ordered the sacrifices, which had been set out, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood and those things that were placed on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when this was done, and the time came when the sun shined brightly, which before was in a cloud, there was kindled a great fire, so much so that all were filled with wonder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But all the priests were reciting prayer, while the sacrifice was being consumed, with Jonathan beginning and the rest answering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the prayer of Nehemiah was held in this way: “O Lord God, Creator of all, terrible and strong, just and merciful, you alone are the good King.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>You alone are excellent, you alone are just, and all-powerful, and eternal, who frees Israel from all evil, who created the chosen fathers and sanctified them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Receive the sacrifice on behalf of all of your people Israel, and preserve and sanctify your portion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Gather together our dispersion, free those who are in servitude to the Gentiles, and respect those who are despised and abhorred, so that the Gentiles may know that you are our God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Afflict those who, in their arrogance, are oppressing us and treating us abusively.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And so the priests sang hymns until the sacrifice had been consumed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But when the sacrifice had been consumed, Nehemiah ordered the remainder of the water to be poured upon the great stones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>When this had been done, a flame was kindled from them, but it was consumed by the light that shined brightly from the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>In truth, when this thing became known, it was reported to the king of Persia that in the place where the fire had been hidden by those priests who had been led away, water appeared, by which Nehemiah, and those who were with him, purified the sacrifices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But the king, considering and examining the matter diligently, made a temple for it, so that he might study what had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when he had studied it, he gave the priests many goods and presents, of one kind or another, and using his own hands, he distributed these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Nehemiah called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted as Purification. But with many it is called Nephi.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For he also drew upon wisdom magnificently, and so, having wisdom, he offered the sacrifice of the dedication and the consummation of the temple.</span></div>

However, it is not true that he will ever be pope or even want to be pope. The Church will be entirely without a Pope during the nearly seven years of the Antichrist’s reign.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-3' href='#cpdv-verse-5-3'>c</a>. <span> God permits the Antichrist to afflict the Church, partly because of the sins of Christians (and partly that they may suffer innocently, as Christ suffered).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-4' href='#cpdv-verse-5-4'>d</a>. <span> Here is an example where word order in Latin is essential to the meaning of the sentence.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-5' href='#cpdv-verse-5-5'>e</a>. <span> A talent is a unit of weight generally associated with silver and gold. One talent is just over 66 pounds in weight. Eighteen hundred talents is a vast amount of precious metals.</span></div>

The Romans and Greeks of that time knew that the world was a sphere. The word ‘terram’ in this context refers to ‘the earth,’ not merely to ‘the land.’ The word ‘pelagus’ refers to the open ocean, not merely to the Mediterranean or the coastal waters. There is no reference here to walking or traveling by foot; the text does not say that he wanted to make the sea passable on foot. It does not say that.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-7' href='#cpdv-verse-5-7'>g</a>. <span> The usual translation of this verse, that he wanted, in effect, to sail on land and walk on water applies to the eschatological meaning of the text: After conquering the king of the South and entering the great Sanctuary of the Faith, the Antichrist will be so elated that he will think to accomplish things beyond mere human ability, such will be the elation of his mind.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-8' href='#cpdv-verse-5-8'>h</a>. <span> On the other hand, in this more literal translation of the text, the historical person Antiochus did not think to sail on land or walk on water. The words ‘foot’ or ‘walk’ are not in the verse. Rather, he thought to circumnavigate the globe. The scholars of that time period did, in fact, know that the earth was a globe, and they could predict the dates of solar and lunar eclipses, and lunar phases.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-9' href='#cpdv-verse-5-9'>i</a>. <span> The phrase ‘omnes perfectæ ætatis’ is here translated similarly to the Jerusalem Bible. This phrase clearly refers to the men only, as the end of the verse indicates, so the use of the word ‘men’ in the translation is justified. Also, the reason for killing all the fit men is that they might become soldiers or join in a rebellion against them. So they killed all the men of military age.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408-10-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Gorgias, when he was the leader of the places, taking to him new arrivals, frequently made war against the Jews.</span></div>
