<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>2 Samuel 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it happened that, after Saul died, David returned from the slaughter of Amalek, and he remained for two days at Ziklag.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then, on the third day, a man appeared, arriving from the camp of Saul, with his garments torn and dust sprinkled on his head. And when he came to David, he fell on his face, and he reverenced.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And David said to him, “Where have you come from?” And he said to him, “I have fled from the camp of Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And David said to him: “What is the word that has happened? Reveal it to me.” And he said: “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people have fallen and died. Moreover, Saul and his son Jonathan have passed away.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David said to the youth who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan have died?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the youth, who was reporting it to him, said: “I arrived by chance on mount Gilboa. And Saul was lying upon his spear. Then the chariots and horsemen drew near to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And turning behind his back and seeing me, he called to me. And when I had responded, “I am here,”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>he said to me, “Who are you?” And I said to him, “I am an Amalekite.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to me: “Stand over me, and kill me. For anguish has taken hold of me, and still my whole life is in me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And standing over him, I killed him. For I knew that he was not able to live after the fall. And I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then David, taking hold of his garments, tore them, with all the men who were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, over Saul and over his son Jonathan, and over the people of the Lord and over the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And David said to the youth who had reported it to him, “Where are you from?” And he responded, “I am the son of a man who is a new arrival from the Amalekites.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to put forth your hand, so that you would kill the Christ of the Lord?”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And calling one of his servants, David said, “Draw near and rush against him” And he struck him, and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And David said to him: “Your blood is upon your own head. For your own mouth has spoken against you, saying: ‘I have killed the Christ of the Lord.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then David mourned a lamentation over Saul and over his son Jonathan, in this way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>(And he instructed that they should teach the sons of Judah the bow, just as it is written in the Book of the Just.)

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The illustrious of Israel have been killed upon your mountains. How could the valiant have fallen?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Do not choose to announce it in Gath, and do not announce it in the crossroads of Ashkelon.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the strong, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Saul and Jonathan, worthy to be loved, and stately in their life: even in death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with scarlet finery, who offered ornaments of gold for your adornment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>How could the valiant have fallen in battle? How could Jonathan have been slain on the heights?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I grieve over you, my brother Jonathan: exceedingly stately, and worthy to be loved above the love of women. As a mother loves her only son, so also did I love you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>How could the robust have fallen, and the weapons of war have perished?”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The term Christ means anointed. However, it is better to translate the Latin Christum as Christ than as anointed, first, because it is closer to the Latin; second, because Saul, and David, and Solomon were each foreshadowings of Jesus the Christ; third, because using the term anointed would obscure the connection between these passages and Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2'>2 Samuel 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so, after these things, David consulted the Lord, saying, “Shall I ascend to one of the cities of Judah?” And the Lord said to him, “Ascend.” And David said, “To where shall I ascend?” And he responded to him, “To Hebron.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, David ascended with his two wives, Ahinoam, the Jezreelite, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And as for the men who were with him, David led forth each man with his household. And they stayed in the towns of Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the men of Judah went and anointed David there, so that he would reign over the house of Judah. And it was reported to David that the men of Jabesh Gilead had buried Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and he said to them: “Blessed are you to the Lord, who has accomplished this mercy with your lord Saul, so that you would bury him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And now, certainly, the Lord will repay to you mercy and truth. But I also will act with favor, because you have accomplished this word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Let your hands be strengthened, and be sons of fortitude. For even though your lord Saul has died, still the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Abner, the son of Ner, the leader of the army of Saul, took Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and he led him around, throughout the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he appointed him as king over Gilead, and over Geshuri, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, was forty years old when he had begun to rule over Israel. And he reigned for two years. For only the house of Judah followed David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the number of the days, during which David was staying and ruling in Hebron over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Abner, the son of Ner, and the youths of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, went out from the camp to Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the youths of David, went out and met them beside the pool of Gibeon. And when they had convened together, they sat down opposite one another: these on one side of the pool, and those on the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Abner said to Joab, “Let the youths rise up and play before us.” And Joab answered, “Let them rise up.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, they rose up and crossed over, twelve in number of Benjamin, from the side of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and twelve of the youths of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And each one, taking hold of his peer by the head, fixed a sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell down together. And the name of that place was called: The Field of the Valiant in Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And a very harsh war rose up on that day. And Abner, with the men of Israel, was put to flight by the youths of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the three sons of Zeruiah were in that place: Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was a very swift runner, like one of the deer that lives in the forest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn aside to the right, nor to the left, to cease in the pursuit of Abner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And so, Abner looked behind his back, and he said, “Are you not Asahel?” And he responded, “I am.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Abner said to him, “Go to the right, or to the left, and apprehend one of the youths, and take his spoils for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to cease from pursuing him closely.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And again, Abner said to Asahel: “Withdraw, and do not choose to follow me. Otherwise, I will be compelled to stab you to the ground, and I will not be able to lift up my face before your brother, Joab.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But he disdained to heed him, and he was not willing to turn aside. Therefore, turning, Abner struck him with his spear in the groin, and he pierced him through, and he died in the same place. And all those who would pass by the place, in which Asahel had fallen and died, would stand still.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now while Joab and Abishai were pursuing Abner as he fled, the sun set. And they went as far as the Hill of the Aqueduct, which is opposite the valley on the way of the desert in Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves to Abner. And being joined in one battle line, they stood at the summit of a hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Abner cried out to Joab, and he said: “Will your sword rage unto utter destruction? Are you ignorant that it is perilous to act in desperation? How long will you not tell the people to cease from the pursuit of their brothers?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Joab said: “As the Lord lives, if you had spoken in the morning, the people would have withdrawn from pursuing their brothers.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Therefore, Joab sounded the trumpet, and the entire army stood still, and they did not pursue after Israel any more, and they did not engage in conflict.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then Abner and his men went away, all that night, through the plains. And they crossed the Jordan, and having roamed throughout all of Beth-horon, they arrived in the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But Joab, returning after he had released Abner, gathered together all the people. And of David’s youths, they were missing nineteen men, aside from Asahel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But of Benjamin and of the men who were with Abner, the servants of David had struck three hundred and sixty, who also died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they took Asahel, and they buried him in the sepulcher of his father at Bethlehem. And Joab, and the men who were with him, walked throughout the night, and they arrived in Hebron at the very break of day.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-65-3'>2 Samuel 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then a long struggle occurred between the house of Saul and the house of David, with David prospering and growing ever stronger, but the house of Saul decreasing daily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And sons were born to David in Hebron. And his firstborn son was Amnon, from Ahinoam the Jezreelite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And after him, there was Chileab, from Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel. Then the third was Absalom, the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. And the fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, the sixth was Ithream, from Eglah, the wife of David. These were born to David at Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then, while there was a battle between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner, the son of Ner, was reigning over the house of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>“Why did you enter to the concubine of my father?” But he, being exceedingly angry at the words of Ishbosheth, said: “Am I the head of a dog against Judah this day? I have shown mercy to the house of Saul, your father, and to his brothers and friends. And I have not delivered you into the hands of David. And yet today you have sought me, so that you might rebuke me over a woman?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>May God do these things to Abner, and may he add these other things, if, in the same way that the Lord swore to David, I do not do so with him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>that the kingdom be transferred from the house of Saul, and that the throne of David be elevated over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he was not able to respond anything to him, because he was in fear of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, Abner sent messengers to David for himself, saying, “Whose is the land?” and so that they would say, “Make a friendship with me, and my hand will be with you, and I will lead back all of Israel to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he said: “It is best. I will make a friendship with you. But one thing I ask of you, saying: You shall not see my face before you bring Michal, the daughter of Saul. And in this way, you shall come, and see me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, saying, “Restore my wife Michal, whom I espoused to myself for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel, the son of Laish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And her husband was following her, weeping, as far as Bahurim. And Abner said to him, “Go and return.” And he returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Likewise, Abner sent word to the elders of Israel, saying: “As much yesterday as the day before, you were seeking David, so that he might reign over you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-83-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore, accomplish it now. For the Lord has spoken to David, saying: ‘By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and of all their enemies.’ ”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he went to David in Hebron with twenty men. And David made a feast for Abner, and for his men who had arrived with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Abner said to David, “I will rise up, so that I may gather all of Israel to you, my lord the king, and so that I may enter into a pact with you, and so that you may reign over all, just as your soul desires.” Then, when David had led Abner away, and he had departed in peace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-87-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>immediately the servants of David and of Joab arrived, after having slain robbers, with exceedingly great spoils.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-88-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Joab, and the entire army that was with him, had arrived afterward. And so, it was reported to Joab, explaining that Abner, the son of Ner, went to the king, and he dismissed him, and he went away in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-89-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Joab entered to the king, and he said: “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him, so that he has gone and departed?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-91-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And so, Joab, going out from David, sent messengers after Abner, and he brought him back from the cistern of Sirah, without David knowing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-92-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him alone to the middle of the gate, so that he might speak to him, but with deceit.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-93-3-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And when David had heard of it, now that the matter was done, he said: “I and my kingdom are clean before the Lord, even forever, of the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-94-3-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And may it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon the entire house of his father.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-97-3-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before the funeral procession of Abner.” Moreover, king David himself was following the casket.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-98-3-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And when they had buried Abner in Hebron, king David lifted up his voice, and he wept over the burial mound of Abner. And all the people also wept.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the Beerothites had fled into Gittaim. And they were strangers there, until that time.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-331-13-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now after these things, it happened that Amnon, the son of David, was in love with the very beautiful sister of Absalom, the son of David, and she was called Tamar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-332-13-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he pined for her exceedingly, so much so that, out of love for her, he became ill. For, since she was a virgin, it seemed a difficulty to him that he would do anything dishonest with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-333-13-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, the brother of David: a very prudent man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-334-13-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Why are you becoming so thin from day to day, O son of the king? Why won’t you tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-335-13-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Jonadab said to him: “Lie down upon your bed, and feign sickness. And when your father will come to visit you, say to him: ‘I ask you to let my sister Tamar come to me, so that she may give me food, and may make a small meal, so that I may eat it from her hand.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-336-13-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And so, Amnon lay down, and he began to act as if he were ill. And when the king had come to visit him, Amnon said to the king, “I beg you to let my sister Tamar come to me, and make in my sight two little portions of food, so that I take it from her hand.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-337-13-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Come to the house of your brother Amnon, and make a small meal for him.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-341-13-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when she had presented the food to him, he took hold of her, and he said, “Come lie with me, my sister.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-346-13-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she answered him, “This evil is greater, which you are now doing against me in driving me away, than what you did before.” But he was not willing to listen to her.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-355-13-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the king said to Absalom: “Do not, my son, do not choose to ask that we may all come and be a burden to you.” Then, after he urged him, and he had refused to go, he blessed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-356-13-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Absalom said, “If you are not willing to come, I beg you, at least let my brother Amnon come with us.” And the king said to him, “It is not necessary that he go with you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-357-13-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Absalom pressed him, and so he sent with him Amnon and all the sons of the king. And Absalom made a feast, like the feast of a king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-358-13-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Absalom commanded his servants, saying: “Observe when Amnon will have become drunk with wine.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-389-14-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And in response, the king said to the woman, “You shall not conceal from me a word of what I ask you.” And the woman said to him, “Speak, my lord the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-390-14-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the king said, “Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?” And the woman answered and said: “By the welfare of your soul, my lord the king, it is neither to the left, nor to the right, in all these things that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab himself instructed me, and he himself placed all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-391-14-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Thus did I turn to this figure of speech, because your servant Joab instructed it.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-392-14-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the king said to Joab: “Behold, your word has succeeded in appeasing me. Therefore, go and call back the boy Absalom.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-393-14-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And falling to the ground upon his face, Joab reverenced, and he blessed the king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-394-14-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Joab rose up, and he went away to Geshur. And he brought Absalom into Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-395-14-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But the king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” And so, Absalom returned to his own house, but he did not see the face of the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-397-14-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when he shaved off his hair, for he shaved it off once a year, because his long hair was burdensome to him, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, by the public weights.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-399-14-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Absalom remained for two years in Jerusalem, and he did not see the face of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-400-14-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And so, he sent to Joab, so that he might send him to the king. But he refused to come to him. And when he had sent a second time, and he had refused to come to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-401-14-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>he said to his servants: “You know that the field of Joab, the one that is near my field, has a harvest of barley.

And the servants of Joab, arriving with their garments torn, said, “The servants of Absalom have set fire to part of the field!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-402-14-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And Joab rose up, and he went to Absalom at his house, and he said, “Why have your servants set fire to my grain field?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-403-14-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And Absalom responded to Joab: “I sent to you, begging that you might come to me, and that I might send you to the king, and that you might say to him: ‘Why was I brought from Geshur?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-404-14-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And so, Joab, entering to the king, reported everything to him. And Absalom was summoned. And he entered to the king, and he reverenced on the face of the earth. And the king kissed Absalom.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-407-15-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, after these things, Absalom obtained for himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men who went before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408-15-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And rising up in the morning, Absalom was standing beside the entrance of the gate.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-409-15-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Absalom would answer him: “Your words seem good and just to me. But there is no one appointed by the king to hear you.” And Absalom would say:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-412-15-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he was doing this to all those of Israel arriving for judgment to be heard by the king. And he solicited the hearts of the men of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-413-15-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then, after forty years, Absalom said to king David: “I should go and pay my vows, which I have vowed to the Lord at Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-414-15-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For your servant made a vow, when he was in Geshur of Syria, saying: If the Lord will lead me back to Jerusalem, I will sacrifice to the Lord.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-421-15-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the servants of the king said to him, “Everything whatsoever that our lord the king will command, we your servants shall carry out willingly.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-427-15-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Ittai responded to the king, by saying, “As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, in whatever place you will be, my lord the king, whether in death or in life, your servant will be there.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-428-15-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And David said to Ittai, “Come, and pass over.” And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all the men who were with him, and the rest of the multitude.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-430-15-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now Zadok the priest also went, and all the Levites went with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-431-15-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the king said to Zadok: “Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he will lead me back. And he will show it to me in his tabernacle.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-447-16-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king said to Ziba, “What do you intend to do with these things?” And Ziba responded: “The donkeys are for the household of the king, so that they may sit.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-448-16-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king said, “Where is the son of your lord?” And Ziba answered the king: “He remained in Jerusalem, saying, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’ ”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-450-16-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then king David went as far as Bahurim.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-451-16-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and throwing stones against David and against all the servants of king David. And all the people and all the warriors were traveling to the right and to the left sides of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-452-16-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, as he was cursing the king, Shimei said: “Go away, go away, you man of blood, and you man of Belial!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-454-16-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king: “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go and cut off his head.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-456-16-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the king said to Abishai and to all his servants: “Behold, my son, who went forth from my loins, is seeking my life.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-484-17-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Absalom, with all the men of Israel, said: “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” So, by an act of the Lord, the useful counsel of Ahithophel was defeated, in order that the Lord might lead evil over Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-485-17-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Hushai said to the priests, Zadok and Abiathar: “Ahithophel gave counsel to Absalom and to the elders of Israel in this and that manner. And I gave counsel in such and such a manner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-486-17-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now therefore, send quickly, and report to David, saying: ‘You shall not stay this night in the plains of the desert.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-487-17-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But Jonathan and Ahimaaz remained beside the Fountain of Rogel. And a handmaid went away and reported it to them. And they set out, so that they might carry the report to king David. For they could not be seen, nor enter into the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-488-17-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But a certain young man saw them, and he revealed it to Absalom. Yet truly, they traveled quickly and entered into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they descended into it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-489-17-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then a woman took and spread a covering over the mouth of the well, as if drying hulled barley. And so the matter was hidden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-490-17-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And when the servants of Absalom had entered into the house, they said to the woman, “Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman responded to them, “They passed through hurriedly, after they had taken a little water.” But those who were seeking them, when they had not found them, returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-491-17-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And when they had gone, they ascended from the well. And traveling, they reported to king David, and they said: “Rise up, and go across the river quickly. For Ahithophel has given a counsel of this kind against you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-492-17-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Therefore, David rose up, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan, until first light. And not even one of them was left behind who had not crossed over the river.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-493-17-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Ahithophel, seeing that his counsel had not been done, saddled his donkey, and he rose up and went away to his own house and to his own city. And putting his house in order, he killed himself by hanging. And he was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-494-17-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then David went to the encampment, and Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-495-17-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Truly, Absalom appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa was the son of a man who was called Ithra of Jezrael, who entered to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, who was the mother of Joab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-496-17-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Israel made camp with Absalom in the land of Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-497-17-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when David had arrived at the encampment, Shobi, the son of Nahash, from Rabbah, of the sons of Ammon, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai, the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-498-17-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>brought to him bedding, and tapestries, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and cooked grain, and beans, and lentils, and fried chick peas,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-499-17-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>and honey, and butter, sheep and fattened calves.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-502-18-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so David, having reviewed his people, appointed over them tribunes and centurions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-503-18-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he placed a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Ittai, who was from Gath. And the king said to the people, “I, too, will go forth with you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-504-18-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the people responded: “You shall not go out. For if we flee, there will not be great concern in them for us. Or if one half part of us will fall, they will not care much. For you are considered as one for ten thousand. Therefore, it is better that you should be in the city to strengthen us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-505-18-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems good to you.” Therefore, the king stood beside the gate. And the people went out by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-506-18-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Preserve for me the boy Absalom.” And all the people heard the king commanding all the leaders on behalf of Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-507-18-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And so, the people departed into the field against Israel. And the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-508-18-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the people of Israel were cut down in that place by the army of David. And a great slaughter occurred on that day: twenty thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-509-18-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the battle in that place was dispersed over the face of all the land. And there were many more of the people whom the forest had consumed, than the sword had devoured, on that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-510-18-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then it happened that Absalom, riding on a mule, met the servants of David. And when the mule had entered under a thick and large oak tree, his head became trapped in the oak. And while he was suspended between heaven and earth, the mule on which he had been sitting continued on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-511-18-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then a certain one saw this and reported it to Joab, saying, “I saw Absalom hanging from an oak.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-512-18-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Joab said to the man who had reported it to him, “If you saw him, why did you not stab him to the ground, and I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-513-18-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he said to Joab: “Even if you weighed out to my hands one thousand silver coins, I would never lay my hands on the son of the king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-514-18-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then too, if I had acted with such audacity, against my own life, this would never have been able to be hidden from the king. And would you then have stood by my side?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-515-18-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Joab said, “It will not be as you wish. Instead, I will be assailing him in your sight.” Then he took three lances in his hand, and he fixed them in the heart of Absalom. And while he was still clinging to life upon the oak,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-516-18-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>ten young men, armor bearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him, they killed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-517-18-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and he held back the people, lest they pursue Israel in their flight, for he was willing to spare the multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-518-18-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they took Absalom, and they threw him into a great pit in the forest. And they piled an exceedingly great heap of stones over him. But all of Israel fled to their own tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-519-18-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now Absalom had raised up for himself, when he was still alive, a monument, which is in the Valley of the King. For he said, “I have no son, and so this shall be the memorial to my name.” And he called the monument by his own name. And it is called the Hand of Absalom, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-520-18-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, “I will run and report to the king that the Lord has accomplished judgment for him, from the hand of his enemies.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-521-18-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Joab said to him: “You shall not be the messenger on this day. Instead, you shall report on another day. I am not willing for you to give the report today, because the son of the king is dead.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-522-18-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Joab said to Hushai, “Go, and report to the king what you have seen.” Hushai reverenced Joab, and he ran.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-523-18-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said to Joab again, “What prevents me from running after Hushai also?” And Joab said to him: “Why do you want to run, my son? You would not be the bearer of good news.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-524-18-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he responded, “But what if I do run?” And he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz, running along a shorter way, passed Hushai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-525-18-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now David was sitting between the two gates. Truly, the watchman, who was at the summit of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-526-18-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And crying out, he told the king. And the king said, “If he is alone, there is good news in his mouth.” But as he was advancing and drawing nearer,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-527-18-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>the watchman saw another man running. And so, crying out from the height, he said: “Another man has appeared, running alone.” And the king said, “This one also is a good messenger.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-528-18-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the watchman said, “The running of the closest one seems like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man, and he arrives bearing good news.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-529-18-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then, Ahimaaz, crying out, said to the king, “Be well, O king.” And reverencing the king prone on the ground before him, he said, “Blessed be the Lord your God, who has enclosed the men who had lifted up their hands against my lord the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-530-18-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And the king said, “Is there peace for the boy Absalom?” And Ahimaaz said: “I saw a great tumult, O king, when your servant Joab sent me, your servant. I know nothing else.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-531-18-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And the king said to him, “Pass, and stand here.” And when he had passed and stood still,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-532-18-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Hushai appeared. And approaching, he said: “I bear good news, my lord the king. For today the Lord has judged for you, from the hand of all who had risen up against you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-533-18-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But the king said to Hushai, “Is there peace for the boy Absalom?” And responding, Hushai said to him, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against him for evil, be as the boy is.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-534-18-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And so the king, being greatly saddened, ascended to the upper room of the gate, and he wept. And as he went, he was speaking in this manner: “My son Absalom! Absalom my son! Who can grant to me that I may die on your behalf? Absalom, my son! My son, Absalom!”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-538-19-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And so the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said on that day, “The king is grieving over his son.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-539-19-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the people declined to enter the city on that day, in the manner that the people were accustomed to decline if they had turned and fled from battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-540-19-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the king covered his head, and he was crying out in a great voice: “My son, Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-541-19-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, Joab, entering to the king in the house, said: “Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who saved your life, and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-542-19-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-543-19-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now then, rise up and go out, and speak so as to make amends to your servants.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-545-19-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And all the people were conflicted, in all the tribes of Israel, saying: “The king has freed us from the hand of our enemies.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-583-20-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it happened that there was, in that place, a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a man of Benjamin. And he sounded the trumpet, and he said: “There is no portion for us in David, nor any inheritance in the son of Jesse. Return to your own tents, O Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-584-20-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And all of Israel separated from David, and they were following Sheba, the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-585-20-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when the king had entered his house at Jerusalem, he took the ten women concubines, whom he had left behind to care for the house, and he put them into custody, allowing them provisions. But he did not enter to them. Instead, they were enclosed, even until the day of their deaths, living as widows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-586-20-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon to me all the men of Judah on the third day, and you shall be present also.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-587-20-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, Amasa went away, so that he might summon Judah. But he delayed beyond the agreed time that the king had appointed to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-588-20-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And David said to Abishai: “Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, will afflict us more so than Absalom did. Therefore, take the servants of your lord, and pursue him, otherwise he may find fortified cities, and escape from us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-589-20-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, the men of Joab departed with him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And all the able-bodied men went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, the son of Bichri.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-590-20-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when they were beside the great stone, which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a close-fitting coat of equal length with his garment. And over these, he was girded with a sword hanging down to his thigh, in a scabbard which was made so that the sword could be removed with the least motion, and then strike.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-591-20-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Joab said to Amasa, “Be well, my brother.” And he held Amasa by the chin with his right hand, as if to kiss him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-592-20-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But Amasa did not notice the sword that Joab had.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-593-20-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Meanwhile, certain men, from the company of Joab, when they had stopped beside the dead body of Amasa, said: “Behold, the one who wished to be in the place of Joab, the companion of David.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-594-20-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now Amasa was covered with blood, and was lying in the middle of the road. A certain man saw this, with all the people standing nearby to look at him, and he removed Amasa from the road into a field. And he covered him with a garment, so that those passing by would not stop because of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-595-20-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then, when he had been removed from the road, all the men continued on, following Joab in the pursuit of Sheba, the son of Bichri.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-596-20-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now he had passed through all the tribes of Israel into Abel and Bethmaacah. And all the elect men had gathered together to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-597-20-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so, they went and besieged him at Abel and Bethmaacah.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-598-20-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And a wise woman exclaimed from the city: “Listen, listen, and say to Joab: Draw near, and I will speak with you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-599-20-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when he had drawn near to her, she said to him, “Are you Joab?” And he responded, “I am.” And she spoke in this way to him, “Listen to the words of your handmaid.” He responded, “I am listening.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-600-20-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And again she spoke: “A word was said in the old proverb, ‘Those who would inquire, let them inquire in Abel.’ And so they would reach a conclusion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-601-20-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Am I not the one who responds with the truth in Israel? And yet you are seeking to overthrow the city, and to overturn a mother in Israel! Why would you cast down the inheritance of the Lord?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-602-20-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And responding, Joab said: “May this be far, may this be far from me! May I not cast down, and may I not demolish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-603-20-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The matter is not as you said. Rather, a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba, the son of Bichri, by name, has lifted up his hand against king David. Deliver him alone, and we will withdraw from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown down to you from the wall.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-604-20-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Therefore, she entered to all the people, and she spoke to them wisely. And they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and they threw it down to Joab. And he sounded the trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, each one to his own tent. But Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-605-20-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Thus Joab was over the entire army of Israel. And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cerethites and Phelethites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-606-20-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Yet truly, Adoram was over the tributes. And Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the keeper of records.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-611-21-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And a famine occurred, during the days of David, for three years continuously.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-612-21-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, the king, calling for the Gibeonites, spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but were the remnant of the Amorites.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-613-21-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, David said to the Gibeonites: “What shall I do for you? And what shall be your satisfaction, so that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-614-21-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Gibeonites said to him: “There is no quarrel for us over silver or gold, but against Saul and against his house. And we do not desire that any man of Israel be put to death.” The king said to them, “Then what do you wish that I should do for you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-615-21-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they said to the king: “The man who unjustly afflicted and oppressed us, we ought to destroy in such manner that not even one of his stock may be left behind in all the parts of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-616-21-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let seven men from his sons be given to us, so that we may crucify them to the Lord in Gibeon of Saul, formerly the chosen place of the Lord.” And the king said, “I will give them.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-618-21-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And so the king took the two sons of Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal, the daughter of Saul, whom she conceived of Adriel, the son of Barzillai, who was from Meholath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-619-21-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites. And they crucified them on a hill in the sight of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-621-21-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And it was reported to David what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-623-21-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he brought the bones of Saul, and the bones of his son Jonathan, from there. And they collected the bones of those who had been crucified.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-625-21-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the Philistines again undertook a battle against Israel. And David descended, and his servants with him, and they fought against the Philistines. But when David grew faint,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-628-21-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Also, a second war occurred in Gob against the Philistines. Then Sibbecai from Hushah struck down Saph, from the stock of Arapha, of the ancestry of the giants.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-690-23-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the last words of David. Now David, the son of Jesse, the man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the preeminent psalmist of Israel said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-691-23-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“The Spirit of the Lord has spoken through me, and his word was spoken through my tongue.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-694-23-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But my house is not so great with God that he should undertake an eternal covenant with me, firm and fortified in all things.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-695-23-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But all prevaricators shall be plucked out like thorns, yet they are not taken away by hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-697-23-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>These are the names of the valiant of David. Sitting in the chair was the wisest leader among the three; he was like a very tender little worm in a tree, who killed eight hundred men in one attack.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-698-23-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>After him, there was Eleazar, the son of his paternal uncle, an Ahohite, who was among the three valiant men who were with David when they chastised the Philistines, and they were gathered together in battle there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-699-23-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when the men of Israel had gone up, he himself stood fast and struck down the Philistines, until his hand grew weak and stiff with the sword. And the Lord wrought a great salvation on that day. And the people who had fled returned to take up the spoils of the slain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-700-23-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And after him, there was Shammah, the son of Agee, from Hara.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-701-23-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>he stood fast in the middle of the field, and it was protected by him. And he struck down the Philistines. And the Lord wrought a great salvation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-702-23-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And moreover, before this, the three who were leaders among the thirty descended and went to David at harvest time, in the cave of Adullam.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-703-23-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David was in a stronghold. Moreover, there was a garrison of the Philistines at that time in Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-704-23-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then David desired, and he said, “If only someone would give me a drink of the water from the cistern, which is in Bethlehem beside the gate!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-705-23-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore, the three valiant men burst into the encampment of the Philistines, and they drew water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which was beside the gate.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-706-23-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>saying: “May the Lord be gracious to me, so that I may not do this.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-707-23-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Also Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was first among the three. It was he who lifted up his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed. And he was renowned among the three,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-709-23-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, a very strong man of great deeds, was from Kabzeel. He slew the two lions of Moab, and he descended and slew a lion in the middle of a den, in the days of snow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-710-23-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He also killed an Egyptian who had a spear in his hand, a man worthy to behold.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-711-23-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, accomplished these things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-732-24-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king said to Joab, the leader of his army, “Travel through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, so that I may know their number.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-734-24-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the words of the king prevailed over the words of Joab and the leaders of the army.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-741-24-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And David rose up in the morning, and the word of the Lord went to Gad, the prophet and seer of David, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-744-24-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then David said to Gad: “I am in great anguish. But it is better that I should fall into the hands of the Lord (for his mercies are many) than into the hands of men.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-745-24-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people, from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-746-24-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And when the Angel of the Lord had extended his hand over Jerusalem, so that he might destroy it, the Lord took pity on the affliction.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-752-24-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Araunah said to David: “May my lord the king offer and accept whatever is pleasing to him. You have oxen for a holocaust, and the cart and the yokes of the oxen to use for wood.”</span></div>
