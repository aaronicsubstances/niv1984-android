<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Certainly, O Theophilus, I composed the first discourse about everything that Jesus began to do and to teach,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>instructing the Apostles, whom he had chosen through the Holy Spirit, even until the day on which he was taken up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He also presented himself alive to them, after his Passion, appearing to them throughout forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God with many elucidations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And dining with them, he instructed them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but that they should wait for the Promise of the Father, “about which you have heard,” he said, “from my own mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For John, indeed, baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days from now.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, those who had assembled together questioned him, saying, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom of Israel?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But he said to them: “It is not yours to know the times or the moments, which the Father has set by his own authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, passing over you, and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when he had said these things, while they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And while they were watching him going up to heaven, behold, two men stood near them in white vestments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And they said: “Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall return in just the same way that you have seen him going up to heaven.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain, which is called Olivet, which is next to Jerusalem, within a Sabbath day’s journey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they had entered into the cenacle, they ascended to the place where Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Jude of James, were staying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>All these were persevering with one accord in prayer with the women, and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In those days, Peter, rising up in the midst of the brothers, said (now the crowd of men altogether was about one hundred and twenty):</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>“Noble brothers, the Scripture must be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit predicted by the mouth of David about Judas, who was the leader of those who apprehended Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this man certainly possessed an estate from the wages of iniquity, and so, having been hanged, he burst open in the middle and all his internal organs poured out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And this became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that this field was called in their language, Akeldama, that is, ‘Field of Blood.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For it has been written in the book of Psalms: ‘Let their dwelling place be desolate and may there be no one who dwells within it,’ and ‘Let another take his episcopate.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore, it is necessary that, out of these men who have been assembling with us throughout the entire time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>beginning from the baptism of John, until the day when he was taken up from us, one of these be made a witness with us of his Resurrection.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they appointed two: Joseph, who was called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And praying, they said: “May you, O Lord, who knows the heart of everyone, reveal which one of these two you have chosen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>to take a place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas prevaricated, so that he might go to his own place.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they cast lots concerning them, and the lot fell upon Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> No one was willing to take down the dead body of someone who had committed suicide, because it was the Feast of Passover, and so his body most probably hung there from Friday, Nisan 14, until at least Saturday, Nisan 22, after sunset. The length of time that he hung there, and the decay of his body, caused his skin to burst open and all his internal organs to pour out.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Barsabbas was clearly the more well-known of the two, since he had two nicknames. He was also held, in the opinion of many to be the holier of the two, for he was called Barsabbas (son of the Sabbath) and Justus (the just one). Yet God chose Matthias over Barsabbas, for God knows the hidden secrets of the soul.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-315-8-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Now the place in Scripture that he was reading was this: “Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter. And like a lamb silent before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-318-8-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Philip, opening his mouth and beginning from this Scripture, evangelized Jesus to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-319-8-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And while they were going along the way, they arrived at a certain water source. And the eunuch said: “There is water. What would prevent me from being baptized?”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-1' href='#cpdv-verse-8-1'>a</a>. <span> It seems from this passage that some early valid Baptisms used only the name of Jesus, and that receiving the Holy Spirit was a separate Sacrament, that of Confirmation.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-328-9-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And as he made the journey, it happened that he was approaching Damascus. And suddenly, a light from heaven shone around him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-344-9-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And immediately, it was as if scales had fallen from his eyes, and he received his sight. And rising up, he was baptized.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-348-9-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Saul was increasing to a greater extent in ability, and so he was confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus, by affirming that he is the Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-352-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when he had arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-353-9-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Barnabas took him aside and led him to the Apostles.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-354-9-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And he was with them, entering and departing Jerusalem, and acting faithfully in the name of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-366-9-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And when they had all been sent outside, Peter, kneeling down, prayed. And turning to the body, he said: “Tabitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes and, upon seeing Peter, sat up again.</span></div>

Also, the verb ‘factus esset’ might seem to mean that they had already made such an assault, but instead the meaning is that they made a plan to carry out the assault.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-756-19-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith making silver shrines for Diana, was providing no small profit to craftsmen.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-760-19-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Upon hearing this, they were filled with anger, and they cried out, saying, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-762-19-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then, when Paul wanted to enter to the people, the disciples would not permit him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-766-19-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But as soon as they realized him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for about two hours, were crying out, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-767-19-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when the scribe had calmed the crowds, he said: “Men of Ephesus, now what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is in the service of the great Diana and of the offspring of Jupiter?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-897-23-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Paul, knowing that one group were Sadducees and the other were Pharisees, exclaimed in the council: “Noble brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees!

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-898-23-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he had said this, a dissension occurred between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And the multitude was divided.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-899-23-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For the Sadducees claim that there is no resurrection, and neither angels, nor spirits. But the Pharisees confess both of these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-900-23-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then there occurred a great clamor. And some of the Pharisees, rising up, were fighting, saying: “We find nothing evil in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-901-23-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And since a great dissension had been made, the tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn apart by them, ordered the soldiers to descend and to seize him from their midst, and to bring him into the fortress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-902-23-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then, on the following night, the Lord stood near him and said: “Be constant. For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so also it is necessary for you to testify at Rome.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-903-23-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when daylight arrived, some of the Jews gathered together and bound themselves with an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-904-23-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now there were more than forty men who had taken this oath together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-905-23-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they approached the leaders of the priests, and the elders, and they said: “We have sworn ourselves by an oath, so that we will taste nothing, until we have killed Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-906-23-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, with the council, you should now give notice to the tribune, so that he may bring him to you, as if you intended to determine something else about him.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-907-23-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when Paul’s sister’s son had heard of this, about their treachery, he went and entered into the fortress, and he reported it to Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-908-23-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Paul, calling to him one of the centurions, said: “Lead this young man to the tribune. For he has something to tell him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-909-23-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And indeed, he took him and led him to the tribune, and he said, “Paul, the prisoner, asked me to lead this young man to you, since he has something to say to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-910-23-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the tribune, taking him by the hand, withdrew with him by themselves, and he asked him: “What is it that you have to tell me?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-911-23-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then he said: “The Jews have met to ask you to bring Paul tomorrow to the council, as if they intended to question him about something else.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-912-23-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But truly, you should not believe them, for they would ambush him with more than forty men from among them, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat, nor to drink, until they have put him to death.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-913-23-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And then the tribune dismissed the young man, instructing him not to tell anyone that he had made known these things to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-922-23-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And I discovered him to be accused about questions of their law. Yet truly, nothing deserving of death or imprisonment was within the accusation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-923-23-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And when I had been given news of ambushes, which they had prepared against him, I sent him to you, notifying his accusers also, so that they may plead their accusations before you. Farewell.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-962-25-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the leaders of the priests, and those first among the Jews, went to him against Paul. And they were petitioning him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-964-25-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Festus responded that Paul was to be kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would soon go there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-967-25-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he had been brought, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, throwing out many serious accusations, none of which they were able to prove.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-968-25-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Paul offered this defense: “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any matter.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-969-25-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Festus, wanting to show greater favor to the Jews, responded to Paul by saying: “Are you willing to ascend to Jerusalem and to be judged there about these things before me?”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-970-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-25-1" id="cpdv-verse-25-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-971-25-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But Paul said: “I stand in Caesar’s tribunal, which is where I ought to be judged. I have done no harm to the Jews, as you well know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-972-25-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For if I have harmed them, or if I have done anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-973-25-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Festus, having spoken with the council, responded: “You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-977-25-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before he who is being accused has been confronted by his accusers and has received the opportunity to defend himself, so as to clear himself of the charges.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-978-25-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, when they had arrived here, without any delay, on the following day, sitting in the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-979-25-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But when the accusers had stood up, they did not present any accusation about him from which I would suspect evil.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-982-25-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But since Paul was appealing to be kept for a decision before Augustus, I ordered him to be kept, until I might send him to Caesar.”</span></div>

This was partly because Claudius, a previous emperor, issued an edict giving the Jewish faith a protected status in the empire.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1001-26-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>This is also how I acted at Jerusalem.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1068-27-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, at the same time loosing the restraints of the rudders.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-27-3' href='#cpdv-verse-27-3'>c</a>. <span> They took the smaller boat used for going ashore into the larger boat and then they used it in strengthening the larger boat. They were afraid that they would hit a sandbar, partly because ships tend to ride low in the water during a storm (because they take on water), and because they had less control over its direction. They took down the sails, so that they would not be driven aground on the island.</span></div>
