<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The way this is phrased in the Latin leaves open the possibility that Amos was not himself so much a shepherd as a shepherd’s helper. He was ‘among’ or ‘with’ the shepherds of Tekoa.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘trituraverint’ means to thresh grain during a harvest. They have threshed or harvested the people of Gilead into iron wagons, i.e. they have harvested them and contained them (implying harshness and some form of captivity or restraint).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘disperdam’ means ‘to destroy’ or ‘to utterly ruin’ or ‘to cause great loss.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> This phrase can be rendered as ‘an excellent captivity,’ or ‘a complete captivity,’ or even ‘a perfect captivity.’ Note that the word ‘sceleribus’ has a strong meaning, perhaps better translated as ‘wicked deeds,’ than as merely ‘crimes.’ It also has the connotation, especially in this context, of sinfulness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> Literally, this last phrase says, ‘and they have not been thinking of the pact of brothers.’ But, from the context, this is not a formal written agreement; it refers to the unspoken alliance or bond among those who are of the same family, or the same nation, or one and the same human race.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> In the Latin, you can see that ‘suum’ refers to Edom, but ‘ejus’ refers to his brother. This would not be apparent in English unless ‘ejus’ is translated loosely as ‘his brother,’ rather than as merely ‘his.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> Literally, ‘tenuerit ultra furorem suum’ is ‘he has kept beyond his anger.’ But in this context it refers to going beyond the limits of one’s anger. Notice how this plays into the next verse, ‘usque in finem.’ He goes beyond the limits of his anger and he holds onto his anger until the limit.</span></div>

But the speaker in this quote (following ‘qui dicitis’) clearly expects the answer to be ‘yes.’ The reason, then, that Numquid is still used is that the one presenting the quote, God, is saying that the true answer is ‘no.’ So, the sinners say, ‘Haven’t we done all this by our own strength?’ They think the answer is ‘yes.’ But God quotes them and their attitude using the word, ‘Numquid’ because the truth is that they have not done these things by their own strength.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-2' href='#cpdv-verse-7-2'>b</a>. <span> The last part of this verse is eloquent and sweeping, until the last word: “and it devoured the manifold abyss and it consumed simultaneously a part.” The word a part does not fit the context. Other possible translations of partem also are equally incongruous to the meaning of the verse. Now ‘partem’ by itself can also mean ‘direction.’ But pair ‘partem’ with ‘simul’ and its meaning takes on a new dimension: “and it devoured the manifold abyss and it consumed simultaneously in every direction.” Now I know that the word ‘every’ in the English translation does not have a counterpart in the Latin, but this phrasing is necessary in order to prevent the loss of meaning of this text. The two words ‘partem’ and ‘simul’ have a greater meaning when used together than when each is alone. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-1' href='#cpdv-verse-9-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘cardinals’ in English is derived from the Latin word for hinges, ‘cardinem.’ So, ‘strike the hinges’ could be translated, or rather interpreted, as ‘strike the Cardinals.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> Here is a typical translator’s dilemma. The verb ‘conteram’ appears three times in one verse, but ‘wipe’ works best as an English translation only in two instances; in the other instance, destroy best expresses the meaning, in context, in English. The word ‘destroy’ is overused in English translations of the Old Testament, and ‘wipe’ is a more eloquent fit, so ‘wipe’ is preferred over ‘destroy’ in the other two instances.</span></div>
