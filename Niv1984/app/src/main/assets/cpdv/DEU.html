<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>Deuteronomy 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the words which Moses spoke to all of Israel, across the Jordan, in the plain of the wilderness opposite the Red Sea, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth, where gold is very plentiful,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>eleven days from Horeb, by way of Mount Seir as far as Kadesh-barnea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses told the sons of Israel all that the Lord had instructed him. And so he spoke to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>after he had struck down Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who resided at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>across the Jordan in the land of Moab. And so, Moses began to explain the law, and to say:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>“The Lord our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying: ‘You have remained long enough on this mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Turn back and go to the mountain of the Amorites, and to the other places which are near it: the plains as well as the mountainous regions, and the low-lying places opposite the south and along the shore of the sea, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>‘Lo,’ he said, ‘I have delivered it to you. Enter and possess that which the Lord swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their offspring after them.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I said to you, at that time:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>‘I alone am not able to sustain you. For the Lord, your God, has multiplied you, and you are today like the stars of heaven, very many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>May the Lord, the God of your fathers, add to this number many thousands more, and may he bless you, just as he has said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Alone, I do not have the strength to endure your arbitrations and judgments and disputes.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Offer, from among you, wise and experienced men, those whose conversation has been proven within your tribes, so that I may appoint them as your rulers.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then you responded to me: ‘What you intend to do is a good thing.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so, I took from your tribes men, wise and noble, and I appointed them as rulers, as tribunes and centurions, and as leaders over fifty and over ten, who would teach you each thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I instructed them, saying: ‘Listen to them, and judge what is just, whether he is one of your citizens or a sojourner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>There shall be no favoritism to any persons. So you shall listen to the little as well as to the great. And you shall not accept anyone’s reputation, for this is the judgment of God. But if anything seems difficult to you, then refer it to me, and I will hear it.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And I instructed you in all that you were obliged to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then, setting out from Horeb, we crossed through a terrible and great wasteland, which you saw along the way of the mountain of the Amorite, just as the Lord our God had instructed us. And when we had arrived at Kadesh-barnea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I said to you: ‘You have arrived at the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God will give to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Gaze upon the land that the Lord your God gives to you. Ascend and possess it, just as the Lord our God has spoken to your fathers. Do not be afraid, and do not become terrified by anything.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And you all approached me and said: ‘Let us send men who may consider the land, and who may report as to the way by which we ought to ascend, and as to which cities we ought to travel.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And since the word was pleasing to me, I sent from among you twelve men, one from each tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>These, when they had set out and had ascended the mountains, arrived as far as the valley of the cluster of grapes. And having considered the land,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>having taken from its fruits in order to show its fertility, they brought these to us, and they said: ‘The land that the Lord our God will give to us is good.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Yet you were not willing to go there. Instead, being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>you murmured in your tents, and you said: ‘The Lord hates us, and therefore he has led us away from the land of Egypt, so that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorite and destroy us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>To where should we ascend? The messengers have terrified our heart by saying: “The multitude is very great, and taller than us. And the cities are great, and the walls extend even to the sky. We have seen the sons of the Anakim there.” ’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And I said to you: ‘Do not be apprehensive, nor should you fear them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The Lord God himself, who is your leader, will fight on your behalf, just as he did in Egypt in the sight of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And in the wilderness (as you yourselves saw), the Lord your God carried you, like a man who is accustomed to carrying his little son, along all the way that you walked, until you arrived at this place.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And yet, despite all of this, you did not believe the Lord your God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>who went before you on the way, and who marked out the place where you should pitch your tents, showing you the way by fire in the night, and by a pillar of cloud in the day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, becoming angry, he swore and said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>‘None of the men of this wicked generation will see the good land, which I have promised by oath to your fathers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>except Caleb the son of Jephuneh. For he himself will see it, and I will give the land on which he has walked to him and to his sons, because he has followed the Lord.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Neither is his indignation with the people a wonder, since the Lord also became angry with me because of you, and so he said: ‘Neither will you enter into that place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But Joshua, the son of Nun, your minister, shall himself enter on your behalf. Exhort and strengthen this man, and he himself shall divide the land by lot to Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Your little ones, about whom you said that they would be led away as captives, and your sons, who to this day are ignorant of the difference between good and evil, they shall enter. And I will give the land to them, and they will possess it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But as for you, turn back and go out to the wilderness, by way of the Red Sea.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And you responded to me: ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will ascend and fight, just as the Lord our God has instructed.’ And having been equipped with weapons, when you were setting out for the mountain,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>the Lord said to me: ‘Say to them: Do not ascend and do not fight. For I am not with you. Otherwise, you may fall in the sight of your enemies.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>I spoke, and you did not listen. But, opposing the order of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you ascended onto the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And so, having gone forth, the Amorite, who was living in the mountains, came against you and pursued you, just as a swarm of bees would do. And he struck you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And when you returned and were weeping in the sight of the Lord, he would not hear you, nor was he willing to agree to your voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Therefore, you camped at Kadesh-barnea for a long time.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>“And setting out from there, we arrived at the wilderness which leads to the Red Sea, just as the Lord had spoken to me. And we encompassed Mount Seir for a long time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord said to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>‘You have encompassed this mountain for long enough. Go forth, toward the north.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And instruct the people, saying: You shall cross through the borders of your brothers, the sons of Esau, who live at Seir, and they will fear you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, take care diligently, lest you be moved against them. For I will not give to you from their land even as much as the step that one foot can tread upon, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You shall buy food from them for money, and you shall eat. You shall draw water for money, and you shall drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Lord your God has blessed you in every work of your hands. The Lord your God, dwelling with you, knows your journey, how you crossed through this great wilderness over forty years, and how you have been lacking in nothing.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when we had passed through our brothers, the sons of Esau, who were living at Seir by the way of the plain from Elath and from Eziongeber, we arrived at the way which leads to the desert of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the Lord said to me: ‘You should not fight against the Moabites, nor should you go to battle against them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The Emim were the first of its inhabitants, a people great and strong, and of such great height, like the race of the Anakim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They were considered to be like giants, and they were like the sons of the Anakim. And, indeed, the Moabites call them: the Emim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The Horites also formerly lived at Seir. When these had been driven out and destroyed, the sons of Esau lived there, just as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then, rising up so as to cross over the torrent Zered, we arrived at the place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then, from the time that we advanced from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the torrent Zered, there were thirty-eight years, until the entire generation of the men who were fit for war had been consumed out of the camp, just as the Lord had sworn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For his hand was against them, so that they would pass away from the midst of the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then, after all the fighting men had fallen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>the Lord spoke to me, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>‘Today, you shall cross the borders of Moab, at the city named Ar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when you have arrived in the vicinity of the sons of Ammon, be careful that you do not fight against them, nor should you be moved to battle.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>It was reputed to be a land of giants. And giants lived there in times past, those whom the Ammonites call the Zamzummim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They are a people, great and numerous, and of lofty stature, like the Anakim, whom the Lord wiped away before their face. And he caused them to live there in place of them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>just as he had done for the sons of Esau, who live at Seir, wiping out the Horites and delivering their land to them, which they possess even to the present time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Likewise the Hevites, who were living in small villages as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappadocians, who went forth from Cappadocia, and they wiped them out and lived in their place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>‘Rise up and cross the torrent Arnon! Behold, I have delivered Sihon, the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, into your hand, and so, begin to possess his land and to engage in battle against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Today I will begin to send the terror and dread of you among the peoples who are living under all of heaven, so that, when they hear your name, they may be afraid, and may tremble in the manner of a woman giving birth, and may be gripped by anguish.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Therefore, I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, with peaceful words, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Sell us food for a price, so that we may eat. Provide us with water for money, and so we will drink. We only ask that you allow us to pass through,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>just as the sons of Esau have done, who live at Seir, and the Moabites, who abide in Ar, until we arrive at the Jordan, and we cross to the land which the Lord our God will give to us.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Sihon, the king of Heshbon, was not willing to grant passage to us.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And the Lord said to me: ‘Behold, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land to you. Begin to possess it.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And Sihon went out to meet us with all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-1' href='#cpdv-verse-14-1'>a</a>. <span> The exact identity of all the animals in this passage is not clear. The ancients did not categorize animals by species, as we do, but by appearance. (The same is true for birds, fish, plants, and gem stones.) The male and female deer are listed separately because they are very different in appearances. Both the domesticated goat and the wild goat are listed so that it is clear that both wild and domesticated forms of any animal are acceptable.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-2' href='#cpdv-verse-14-2'>b</a>. <span> The giraffe is a kosher animal, as are all the animals in the list of this verse. The giraffe is listed as an example of the limits of the range of animals which could be eaten. So the list is a partial list of examples, not an exhaustive list. But in such partial lists, it is helpful to have examples from the full range, i.e. some common examples of kosher animals (sheep) and also much less common examples. At the far end of this set of examples is the giraffe, listed not so as to encourage the Israelites to hunt and eat giraffe, but so as to show how broad the range is of kosher animals.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-3' href='#cpdv-verse-14-3'>c</a>. <span> Bats are categorized with birds because they all fly. This is not an error; it is merely a different, and very practical, way of categorizing animals.</span></div>

Also, this does not refer to slavery, but to indentured servitude. This type of indentured servitude was necessary because there were few jobs and few occupations. If one did not have land or family to depend upon, one would need to attach one’s self to a landowner. A six year term of work was job security, at a time and in a culture with no police, nor hospitals, no government assistance programs for the poor. One could easily die without such an indentured servitude. This is also why the option to stay on permanently was offered, because there may be few other opportunities in that society at that time, and many dangers for those who would be on their own.</span></div>
