<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“Thus says Cyrus, the king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me, and he himself has instructed me that I should build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who among you is from his entire people? May his God be with him.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-10-1' href='#cpdv-verse-10-1'>a</a>. <span> Taking foreign wives was offensive, not because of their ancestry, but because of the absence among them of the Jewish faith. Even in ancient times, the Law permitted persons of non-Hebrew ancestry to join with the Israelites, to accept the Jewish faith, and to be treated as Jews under the Law. So the wives were foreign in the sense that they were non-Jews, not because they were non-Hebrews. For an example of a non-Hebrew wife acceptable to the Jews, see the book of Ruth.</span></div>
