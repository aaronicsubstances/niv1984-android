<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>Galatians 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle, not from men and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and all the brothers who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>who gave himself on behalf of our sins, so that he might deliver us from this present wicked age, according to the will of God our Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To him is glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I wonder that you have been so quickly transferred, from him who called you into the grace of Christ, over to another gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For there is no other, except that there are some persons who disturb you and who want to overturn the Gospel of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But if anyone, even we ourselves or an Angel from Heaven, were to preach to you a gospel other than the one that we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Just as we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone has preached a gospel to you, other than that which you have received, let him be anathema.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For am I now persuading men, or God? Or, am I seeking to please men? If I still were pleasing men, then I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I would have you understand, brothers, that the Gospel which has been preached by me is not according to man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I did not receive it from man, nor did I learn it, except through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For you have heard of my former behavior within Judaism: that, beyond measure, I persecuted the Church of God and fought against Her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my equals among my own kind, having proven to be more abundant in zeal toward the traditions of my fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But, when it pleased him who, from my mother’s womb, had set me apart, and who has called me by his grace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>to reveal his Son within me, so that I might evangelize him among the Gentiles, I did not next seek the consent of flesh and blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Neither did I go to Jerusalem, to those who were Apostles before me. Instead, I went into Arabia, and next I returned to Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter; and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Next, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For they had only heard that: “He, who formerly persecuted us, now evangelizes the faith which he once fought.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they glorified God in me.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> This James is James the Less, who stayed in Jerusalem, while the other Apostles went out to preach the Gospel to the world. He functioned as the spiritual leader of the city where Christ preached and died; he was the Bishop of Jerusalem. He was called the brother of the Lord because he was a cousin of Jesus, and also because he was similar in appearances to Jesus.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2'>Galatians 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Next, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, taking with me Barnabas and Titus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And I went up according to revelation, and I debated with them about the Gospel that I am preaching among the Gentiles, but away from those who were pretending to be something, lest perhaps I might run, or have run, in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Gentile, was not compelled to be circumcised,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>but only because of false brothers, who were brought in unknowingly. They entered secretly to spy on our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might reduce us to servitude.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>We did not yield to them in subjection, even for an hour, in order that the truth of the Gospel would remain with you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and away from those who were pretending to be something. (Whatever they might have been once, it means nothing to me. God does not accept the reputation of a man.) And those who were claiming to be something had nothing to offer me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But it was to the contrary, since they had seen that the Gospel to the uncircumcised was entrusted to me, just as the Gospel to the circumcised was entrusted to Peter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For he who was working the Apostleship to the circumcised in Peter, was also working in me among the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, when they had acknowledged the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed like pillars, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we would go to the Gentiles, while they went to the circumcised,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>asking only that we should be mindful of the poor, which was the very thing that I also was solicitous to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when Cephas had arrived at Antioch, I stood against him to his face, because he was blameworthy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For before certain ones arrived from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they had arrived, he drew apart and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the other Jews consented to his pretense, so that even Barnabas was led by them into that falseness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But when I had seen that they were not walking correctly, by the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas in front of everyone: “If you, while you are a Jew, are living like the Gentiles and not the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to keep the customs of the Jews?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>By nature, we are Jews, and not of the Gentiles, sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And we know that man is not justified by the works of the law, but only by the faith of Jesus Christ. And so we believe in Christ Jesus, in order that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law. For no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are also found to be sinners, would then Christ be the minister of sin? Let it not be so!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if I rebuild the things that I have destroyed, I establish myself as a prevaricator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For through the law, I have become dead to the law, so that I may live for God. I have been nailed to the cross with Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I live; yet now, it is not I, but truly Christ, who lives in me. And though I live now in the flesh, I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and who delivered himself for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I do not reject the grace of God. For if justice is through the law, then Christ died in vain.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-52-3'>Galatians 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>O senseless Galatians, who has so fascinated you that you would not obey the truth, even though Jesus Christ has been presented before your eyes, crucified among you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I wish to know only this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Are you so foolish that, though you began with the Spirit, you would now end with the flesh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Have you been suffering so much without a reason? If so, then it is in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, does he who distributes the Spirit to you, and who works miracles among you, act by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>It is just as it was written: “Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, know that those who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Thus Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, foretold to Abraham: “All nations shall be blessed in you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, those who are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it has been written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things that have been written in the book of the Law, so as to do them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And, since in the law no one is justified with God, this is manifest: “For the just man lives by faith.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the law is not of faith; instead, “he who does these things shall live by them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, since he became a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is anyone who hangs from a tree.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>This was so that the blessing of Abraham might reach the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, in order that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Brothers (I speak according to man), if a man’s testament has been confirmed, no one would reject it or add to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. He did not say, “and to descendants,” as if to many, but instead, as if to one, he said, “and to your offspring,” who is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-3-1" id="cpdv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But I say this: the testament confirmed by God, which, after four hundred and thirty years became the Law, does not nullify, so as to make the promise empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if the inheritance is of the law, then it is no longer of the promise. But God bestowed it to Abraham through the promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Why, then, was there a law? It was established because of transgressions, until the offspring would arrive, to whom he made the promise, ordained by Angels through the hand of a mediator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now a mediator is not of one, yet God is one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So then, was the law contrary to the promises of God? Let it not be so! For if a law had been given, which was able to give life, truly justice would be of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Scripture has enclosed everything under sin, so that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But before the faith arrived, we were preserved by being enclosed under the law, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And so the law was our guardian in Christ, in order that we might be justified by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78-3-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But now that faith has arrived, we are no longer under a guardian.</span></div>
