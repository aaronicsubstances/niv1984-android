<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In many places and in many ways, in past times, God spoke to the fathers through the Prophets;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again, when he brings the only-begotten Son into the world, he says: “And let all the Angels of God adore him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And about the Angels, certainly, he says: “He makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But about the Son: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of equity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>You have loved justice, and you have hated iniquity. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation, above your companions.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And: “In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth. And the heavens are the work of your hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But to which of the Angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?”</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-19-2'>Hebrews 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For this reason, it is necessary for us to observe more thoroughly the things that we have heard, lest we let them slip away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if a word that was spoken through the Angels has been made firm, and every transgression and disobedience has received the recompense of a just retribution,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>in what way might we escape, if we neglect such a great salvation? For though initially it had begun to be described by the Lord, it was confirmed among us by those who heard him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>with God testifying to it by signs and wonders, and by various miracles, and by the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, in accord with his own will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For God did not subject the future world, about which we are speaking, to the Angels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But someone, in a certain place, has testified, saying: “What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the Son of man, that you visit him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You have reduced him to a little less than the Angels. You have crowned him with glory and honor, and you have set him over the works of your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>You have subjected all things under his feet.” For in as much as he has subjected all things to him, he has left nothing not subject to him. But in the present time, we do not yet perceive that all things have been made subject to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Yet we understand that Jesus, who was reduced to a little less than the Angels, was crowned with glory and honor because of his Passion and death, in order that, by the grace of God, he might taste death for all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For it was fitting for him, because of whom and through whom all things exist, who had led many children into glory, to complete the authorship of their salvation through his Passion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, are all from One. For this reason, he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>“I will announce your name to my brothers. In the midst of the Church, I will praise you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And again: “I will be faithful in him.” And again: “Behold, I and my children, whom God has given to me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, because children have a common flesh and blood, he himself also, in like manner, has shared in the same, so that through death, he might destroy him who held the dominion of death, that is, the devil,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and so that he might free those who, through the fear of death, had been condemned to servitude throughout their entire life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For at no time did he take hold of the Angels, but instead he took hold of the offspring of Abraham.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, it is fitting for him to be made similar to his brothers in all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful High Priest before God, in order that he might bring forgiveness to the offenses of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For in as much as he himself has suffered and has been tempted, he also is able to assist those who are tempted.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-40-3'>Hebrews 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He is faithful to the One who made him, just as Moses also was, with his entire house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For this Jesus was considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, so much so that the house which he has built holds a greater honor than the former one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For every house is built by someone, but God is the One who has created all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And certainly Moses was faithful, with his entire house, like any servant, as a testimony to those things that would soon be said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet truly, Christ is like a Son in his own house. We are that house, if we firmly retain the faithfulness and the glory of hope, even unto the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because of this, it is just as the Holy Spirit says: “If today you hear his voice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, the very day of temptation, in the desert,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>where your fathers tested me, even though they had seen and examined my works for forty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For this reason, I was enraged against this generation, and I said: They always wander astray in heart. For they have not known my ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So it is as I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Be cautious, brothers, lest perhaps there may be, in any of you, an evil heart of unbelief, turning aside from the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Instead, exhort one another every day, while it is still called ‘today,’ so that none of you may become hardened through the falseness of sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For we have been made participants in Christ. This is only so, if we firmly retain the beginning of his substance, even unto the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For it has been said: “If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts, in the same manner as in the former provocation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For some of those listening did provoke him. But not all of these had set forth from Egypt through Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So against whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not those who had sinned, whose dead bodies lay prostrate in the desert?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest, except to those who were incredulous?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And so, we perceive that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-61-4'>Hebrews 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, we should be afraid, lest the promise of entering into his rest may be relinquished, and some of you may be judged to be lacking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For this was announced to us in a similar manner as to them. But the mere hearing of the word did not benefit them, since it was not joined together with a faith in those things that they heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we who have believed shall enter into rest, in the same manner as he said: “So it is as I have sworn in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest!” And certainly, this is when the works from the foundation of the world have been finished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For, in a certain place, he spoke about the seventh day in this manner: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And in this place again: “They shall not enter into my rest!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, this is because certain ones remain who are to enter into it, and those to whom it was announced first did not enter into it, because of unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Again, he defines a certain day, after so much time, saying in David, “Today,” just as it was stated above, “If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For if Jesus had offered them rest, he would never have spoken, afterward, about another day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, there remains a Sabbath of rest for the people of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For whoever has entered into his rest, the same has also rested from his works, just as God did from his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, let us hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For the Word of God is living and effective: more piercing than any two-edged sword, reaching to the division even between the soul and the spirit, even between the joints and the marrow, and so it discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-4-1" id="cpdv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, since we have a great High Priest, who has pierced the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold to our confession.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to have compassion on our infirmities, but rather one who was tempted in all things, just as we are, yet without sin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81-5-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For every high priest, having been taken from among men, is appointed on behalf of men toward the things which pertain to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>he is able to commiserate with those who are ignorant and who wander astray, because he himself is also encompassed by infirmity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-83-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And because of this, he also must make such offerings for sins even for himself, in the same manner as for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-84-5-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Neither does anyone take up this honor himself, but rather he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85-5-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Thus, even Christ did not glorify himself, so as to become High Priest, but instead, it was God who said to him: “You are my Son. Today I have begotten you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86-5-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And similarly, he says in another place: “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-87-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>It is Christ who, in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offered prayers and supplications to the One who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence.</span></div>

It is like saying, “If I do not do this thing that I swear to do (or, “Unless I do this thing that I swear to do”), then may that bad thing happen to me.” However, the latter part of stating the bad thing is left off, in this case because God cannot fail to accomplish what He has sworn, and because nothing bad can happen to God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-127-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But this man, whose lineage is not enumerated with them, received tithes from Abraham, and he blessed even the one who held the promises.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For since the priesthood has been transferred, it is necessary that the law also be transferred.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-145-7-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But this man, because he continues forever, has an everlasting priesthood.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-157-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But now he has been granted a better ministry, so much so that he is also the Mediator of a better testament, which has been confirmed by better promises.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-168-9-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For a tabernacle was made at first, in which were the lampstand, and the table, and the bread of the Presence, which is called Holy.</span></div>

So this part does not refer to an unjust persecution, nor to the unending suffering of Hell. For those in Purgatory suffer after death, yet find a better resurrection after their suffering. Literally, the verb refers to being racked (stretched out on a rack as an ancient form of severe punishment). The sufferings of Purgatory are more severe than any tortures of earth, although in Purgatory, the faithful souls there only have souls, not bodies, so their sufferings are spiritual only, not physical.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-328-13-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>We have an altar: those who serve in the tabernacle have no authority to eat from it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-334-13-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But do not be willing to forget good works and fellowship. For God is deserving of such sacrifices.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-336-13-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Pray for us. For we trust that we have a good conscience, being willing to conduct ourselves well in all things.</span></div>
