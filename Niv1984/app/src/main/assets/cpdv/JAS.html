<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>James, servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes of the dispersion, greetings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My brothers, when you have fallen into various trials, consider everything a joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>knowing that the proving of your faith exercises patience,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and patience brings a work to perfection, so that you may be perfect and whole, deficient in nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if anyone among you is in need of wisdom, let him petition God, who gives abundantly to all without reproach, and it shall be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But he should ask with faith, doubting nothing. For he who doubts is like a wave on the ocean, which is moved about by the wind and carried away;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>then a man should not consider that he would receive anything from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For a man who is of two minds is inconstant in all his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now a humble brother should glory in his exaltation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and a rich one, in his humiliation, for he will pass away like the flower of the grass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the sun has risen with a scorching heat, and has dried the grass, and its flower has fallen off, and the appearance of its beauty has perished. So also will the rich one wither away, according to his paths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed is the man who suffers temptation. For when he has been proven, he shall receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>No one should say, when he is tempted, that he was tempted by God. For God does not entice toward evils, and he himself tempts no one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Yet truly, each one is tempted by his own desires, having been enticed and drawn away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Thereafter, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. Yet truly sin, when it has been consummated, produces death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And so, do not choose to go astray, my most beloved brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Every excellent gift and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor any shadow of alteration.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For by his own will he produced us through the Word of truth, so that we might be a kind of beginning among his creatures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You know this, my most beloved brothers. So let every man be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to anger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the anger of man does not accomplish the justice of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Because of this, having cast away all uncleanness and an abundance of malice, receive with meekness the newly-grafted Word, which is able to save your souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So be doers of the Word, and not listeners only, deceiving yourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For if anyone is a listener of the Word, but not also a doer, he is comparable to a man gazing into a mirror upon the face that he was born with;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and after considering himself, he went away and promptly forgot what he had seen.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But he who gazes upon the perfect law of liberty, and who remains in it, is not a forgetful hearer, but instead a doer of the work. He shall be blessed in what he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But if anyone considers himself to be religious, but he does not restrain his tongue, but instead seduces his own heart: such a one’s religion is vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>This is religion, clean and undefiled before God the Father: to visit orphans and widows in their tribulations, and to keep yourself immaculate, apart from this age.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘nativitatis’ refers to one’s birth, so ‘vultum nativitatis’ is the face one was born with, i.e. the natural appearance of a man given to him by God. (Now I know that ‘was born with’ is grammatically incorrect because it has a dangling preposition, but this is the way that people talk, so it sounds more natural to phrase it this way.)</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> By ‘qualis’ is meant the manner of his appearances when he looks in the mirror, in other words, what he sees in the mirror, his God-given appearances.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2'>James 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>My brothers, within the glorious faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, do not choose to show favoritism toward persons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if a man has entered your assembly having a gold ring and splendid apparel, and if a poor man has also entered, in dirty clothing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and if you are then attentive to the one who is clothed in excellent apparel, so that you say to him, “You may sit in this good place,” but you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit below my footstool,”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>are you not judging within yourselves, and have you not become judges with unjust thoughts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>My most beloved brothers, listen. Has not God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that God has promised to those who love him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have dishonored the poor. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you through power? And are not they the ones who drag you to judgment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Are not they the ones who blaspheme the good name which has been invoked over you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So if you perfect the regal law, according to the Scriptures, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” then you do well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if you show favoritism to persons, then you commit a sin, having been convicted again by the law as transgressors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now whoever has observed the whole law, yet who offends in one matter, has become guilty of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not kill.” So if you do not commit adultery, but you kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So speak and act just as you are beginning to be judged, by the law of liberty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For judgment is without mercy toward him who has not shown mercy. But mercy exalts itself above judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>My brothers, what benefit is there if someone claims to have faith, but he does not have works? How would faith be able to save him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So if a brother or sister is naked and daily in need of food,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and if anyone of you were to say to them: “Go in peace, keep warm and nourished,” and yet not give them the things that are necessary for the body, of what benefit is this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Thus even faith, if it does not have works, is dead, in and of itself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now someone may say: “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works! But I will show you my faith by means of works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You believe that there is one God. You do well. But the demons also believe, and they tremble greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So then, are you willing to understand, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was not our father Abraham justified by means of works, by offering his son Isaac upon the altar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Do you see that faith was cooperating with his works, and that by means of works faith was brought to fulfillment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And so the Scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.” And so he was called the friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Do you see that a man is justified by means of works, and not by faith alone?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Similarly also, Rahab, the harlot, was she not justified by works, by receiving the messengers and sending them out through another way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>My brothers, not many of you should choose to become teachers, knowing that you shall receive a stricter judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we all offend in many ways. If anyone does not offend in word, he is a perfect man. And he is then able, as if with a bridle, to lead the whole body around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For so we put bridles into the mouths of horses, in order to submit them to our will, and so we turn their whole body around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Consider also the ships, which, though they are great and may be driven by strong winds, yet they are turned around with a small rudder, to be directed to wherever the strength of the pilot might will.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘modesta’ in this context is closer to meekness, or even self-restraint, than to modesty. The idea of modesty is included in ‘pudica’. Notice the progression that is necessary to obtain and increase in wisdom: first one must be chaste, for the unchaste are never wise, then peaceful, for violence does not lead to wisdom, then meek, then open to accepting truth, then actually consenting to those truths and other good things, which then results in the ability to be merciful and to bear much fruit.</span></div>
