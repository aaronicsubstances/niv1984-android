<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a man in the land of Uz named Job, and he was a simple and honest man, fearing God and withdrawing from evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And there had been born to him seven sons and three daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, along with five hundred pairs of oxen and five hundred she-donkeys, and also a very large family.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sons went and made a feast by houses, each one on his day. And sending, they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when the days of their feasting had been completed, Job sent to them and sanctified them, and, getting up at dawn, he offered holocausts for each one.

<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Lord said to him, “Where do you come from?” Answering, he said, “I have circled the land, and walked around in it.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Answering him, Satan said, “Does Job fear God to no purpose?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Have you not fortified him, as well as his house and every one of his belongings around him, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession has increased in the land?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So, on a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their first-born brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>a messenger came to Job, who said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were grazing beside them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and the Sabeans rushed in and carried away everything, and they struck the servants with the sword; and I alone evaded them to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And while he was still speaking, another arrived, and he said, “The fire of God fell from heaven, and, having struck the sheep and the servants, it consumed them; and I alone escaped to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And while he also was still speaking, another arrived, and he said, “The Chaldeans organized three attacks, and advanced on the camels and took them; and not only that, but they have struck the servants with the sword; and I alone fled to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-3" id="cpdv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>when suddenly a severe wind rushed forth from a region of the desert and shook the four corners of the house, which collapsed and crushed your children, and they are dead; and I alone escaped to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Job got up and tore his garments, and, having shaved his head, he collapsed on the ground, and worshipped,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and he said, “Naked I departed from my mother’s womb, and naked I shall return.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In all this, Job did not sin by his lips, nor did he speak any foolish thing against God.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The Book of Job is about events in the life of a man named Job. It is also about the future sufferings of the Church. Job is the Church. The sufferings of Job are the sufferings of the Church. The Book of Job is not only about the one man Job who suffered greatly, but it is also about the tribulation of the Church during the end times. There are repeated spiritual references to afflictions also mentioned in the Book of Revelation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase ‘benedixerint Deo’ literally means ‘they have blessed God.’ But the expression ‘bless God’ in ancient times was sometimes used to mean the opposite, as in ‘they have cursed God.’ Job is concerned that his sons may have sinned either by cursing God in their hearts (or attitudes), or by not blessing God. For to refrain from praising God is to curse God.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich interprets the phrase ‘while he was still speaking’ in this passage to mean that, while the previous event was still a topic of conversation for people, the next event occurred. It is not literal, but figurative.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2'>Job 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But it happened that, on a certain day, when the sons of God had arrived and they stood before the Lord, Satan likewise arrived among them, and he stood in his sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So the Lord said to Satan, “Where do you come from?” Answering, he said, “I have circled the land, and walked around in it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Satan, “Have you not considered my servant, Job, that there is no one like him in the land, a simple and honest man, fearing God and withdrawing from evil, and still retaining his innocence? Yet you have stirred me against him, so that I would afflict him to no purpose.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Answering him, Satan said, “Skin for skin; and everything that a man has, he will give for his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Yet send your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and then you will see whether or not he blesses you to your face.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but even so, spare his life.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, Satan departed from the face of the Lord and he struck Job with a very serious ulcer from the sole of the foot all the way to the crown of his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So he took a shard of earthenware and scraped the discharge, while sitting on a heap of refuse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But his wife said to him, “Do you still continue in your simplicity? Bless God and die.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He said to her, “You have spoken like one of the foolish wives. If we accepted good things from the hand of God, why should we not accept bad things?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so, three friends of Job, hearing about all the evil that had befallen him, arrived, each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had agreed to come together to visit and console him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when they had raised up their eyes from a distance, they did not recognize him, and, crying out, they wept, and, tearing their garments, they scattered dust over their heads into the sky.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his sorrow was very great.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-43-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> Job’s wife says, ‘Bless God,’ but she means, ‘Curse God.’ The expression ‘Curse God’ is so reprehensible to the devout that they would express this idea by saying ‘Bless God,’ not wanting to even speak the word.</span></div>

The six years of tribulation refers to the six plus years of the Antichrist’s reign. In the seventh year of the Antichrist’s reign, he will be defeated; he will not complete the seventh year of his reign. (Compare this translation to the translation, in the book of Daniel, where the text says seventy groups of seven, but the usual translation is seventy weeks of years.)</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-2' href='#cpdv-verse-18-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase ‘primogenita mors’ means ‘first-born death,’ but it has been translated as ‘ancient death’ because the first-born is the eldest son.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-3' href='#cpdv-verse-18-3'>c</a>. <span> Here tabernacle can mean tent or house, but it is translated more literally so that the additional possible meaning of a religious house or church can be included in the range of possible meanings.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-6' href='#cpdv-verse-18-6'>f</a>. <span> The word ‘iniqui,’ and similar words in the Bible, tend to be translated by scholars with more extreme terms like wicked or evil-doers, because the scholars don’t want to use words that might apply such passages to themselves. But, truly, each of us is, to one extent or another, a sinner or an impious person. Such passages are not referring only to the extreme case of the most wicked, but to all sinners.</span></div>

So, the text has two possible meanings, which affect the translation. It could be translated as: ‘yet there is not staff of God over them.’ In other words, the impious prosper without God’s help. Or, it could be translated as: ‘and there is no rod of God over them,’ meaning that there is no rod of punishment from God hanging over their head.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-24-1' href='#cpdv-verse-24-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘spicas’ is usually translated as ‘ears of corn.’ However, the Middle East had no maize (called ‘corn’ in the United States) at that time in history. The word ‘spicas’ and the word ‘corn’ refer to grain in general, such as wheat, barley, or flax.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-24-2' href='#cpdv-verse-24-2'>b</a>. <span> So, why does this passage complain that the naked as well as the hungry have grain taken away from them? Because clothing was made from flax, a type of grain, which also provided grain for food. This passage complains that they have taken away various types of grain from the poor, including types of grain used for food, and flax which was used for both food and clothing. The word ‘spicas’ is therefore translated as ‘sheaves of grain,’ so as to include the stalks of grain used to make clothing and the various types of grain used for food.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-24-3' href='#cpdv-verse-24-3'>c</a>. <span> The use of the word ‘interficit’ implies that such killings are not the actions of criminals, but of persons with power and authority in society. The word ‘interficit’ is not used for criminal murders, but for executions by authority. This passage calls such persons, who unjustly use authority to cause the deaths of others, ‘homicida’ (killer of men), because this word can refer either to criminal murderers, or to others who kill without breaking the law (such as soldiers in battle). In other words, such persons kill under guise of authority, but are no better than murderers and theives (stealing peoples lives and livelihoods).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-24-4' href='#cpdv-verse-24-4'>d</a>. <span> The first part of this verse is difficult to understand. The passage talks about evil-doers, such as persons with power who abuse the poor, and murderers, and adulterers. Who is nimble on the surface (or face) of water? Christ walked on water, but this passage is about an evil person. It is about the Antichrist, who will be nimble on the surface of water, and a murderer, and an adulterer, and someone who abuses the poor.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-30-1' href='#cpdv-verse-30-1'>a</a>. <span> The first part of this verse does not say that God has changed into cruelty, but rather that God has changed Job ‘into hardness’ or ‘to have a hard heart.’ Notice the play on words (which is almost lost by the Latin using two different words, crudelem and duritia, to refer to hardness). God ‘has been changing’ Job into hardness and God has a ‘hard hand.’ In English, we do not use the perfect passive participle nearly as often as it is used in Latin. Therefore, ‘has been changing’ is better rendered as ‘have changed.’ The translation then becomes: “You have changed me into hardness, and, with the hardness of your hand, you have opposed me.”</span></div>

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-878-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-1' href='#cpdv-verse-31-1'>a</a>. <span> The Latin word ‘et’ is usually translated as ‘and,’ but in this and certain other contexts, it clearly means ‘or.’ Job is not saying: ‘If I have done all three of these things,’ but rather, ‘If I have done any one of these things.’ Therefore, the translation is ‘or’ not ‘and.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-2' href='#cpdv-verse-31-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘utero’ is more general in meaning in Latin than the word ‘uterus’ is in English. The Latin ‘utero’ can refer to a male’s abdomen or to a woman’s womb. So, why does the Latin use two words, utero and vulva, and two questions (or a two-part question) to ask the same thing? Because the masculine singular word utero refers, not to the womb, but to the father’s (not well understood during Job’s day) genitive capability, and the word vulva refers to the mother’s genitive capability.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-3' href='#cpdv-verse-31-3'>c</a>. <span> Job is listing sinful things that he has not done, so this good deed is spoken of in the negative: ‘Si non dixerunt....’ The good deed is that any men who came around his tabernacle (or tent or home) knew that they might obtain food from him if they were hungry. The Latin is here translated loosely, because a strict literal translation would be more difficult to understand. Here ‘carnibus’ does not specifically refer to meat (or flesh), but to food or a meal. Notice that ‘Quis’ is not to be understood as the word ‘Who’ introducing a question, but as a pronoun, better translated as ‘He’ than as ‘Who.’ Latin uses ‘quis’ as a pronoun in a way that English rarely uses the word ‘who.’ The quote here, beginning with ‘Quis’ could be translated as a question, but it is more clearly understood in its proper meaning when translated as a statement. The hungry knew that they could count on Job for food when they were hungry. Notice also that the genitive ‘tabernaculi mei,’ referring to ‘viri’ does not connotate possession (the men of my tabernacle), for the next verse clearly indicates that these men are foreigners or travelers, not the men working or living at Job’s home. The genitive case can occasionally mean ‘among’ or ‘around’ rather than ‘of.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-4' href='#cpdv-verse-31-4'>d</a>. <span> Again, the word ‘quis’ in Latin does not always mean ‘who,’ even when used in a question. In this case, Job is referring to all of the previous ‘if...’ propositions, saying, if all of these faults had been found in Job, would He still grant Job a favorable hearing and a clear vindication? No, He would not. ‘Quis’ is here used as a pronoun referring to God.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-5' href='#cpdv-verse-31-5'>e</a>. <span> This verse does not say: ‘if I have eaten of its fruits without money,’ but rather: ‘if I have used its fruits for nothing except money.’ The first translation does not make any sense. The second translation makes sense and fits with the theme of this part of the Book of Job, wherein Job lists the faults he doesn’t have. The word ‘comedi’ can refer to eating, but it can also refer to other kinds of consuming or the using of something. The word ‘absque’ can be translated as ‘without,’ but it can also mean ‘except for’ or ‘nothing but.’ Job is saying that it would be a sin to use the land as nothing but a source of money for himself.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-32-1' href='#cpdv-verse-32-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘spiritus’ should not be capitalized here, as if it referred to the Spirit of God. The word ‘spiritus’ refers to the breath, or the breath of life, or life, or spirit. It does not refer to the soul, however. The ancient view of the human person was: body, breath of life (spiritus), and soul (anima). Here Eliu is saying that there is only breath or wind in men, and that, if any man has understanding, it is a gift from God.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-32-2' href='#cpdv-verse-32-2'>b</a>. <span> The expression ‘ne forte’ can be translated as ‘lest,’ but it has a negative connotation in Latin. So a better translation would preserve that negation. The quotation here is only two words: “Invenimus sapientiam.” And the last part explains that God chose to defeat Job through a young man (Eliu), so that it could be seen that such wisdom must have come from God, not man.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-32-3' href='#cpdv-verse-32-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘steterunt’ in this context does not refer to standing, but to remaining or persevering, i.e. ‘they stood firm’ in their refusal to respond. Notice that Eliu is now addressing Job, so that he calls the others ‘they.’ The previous verse, 32:15, is not a quote of Eliu speaking, but is used to separate the section where Eliu addresses the three men from the section where Eliu addresses Job.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-1' href='#cpdv-verse-36-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘complebunt’ can mean to fill or to complete. The verse is translated somewhat loosely, such that both meanings are used:  fill up their days and complete their years.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-2' href='#cpdv-verse-36-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘clamabunt’ means to cry out or to call on the name of someone; in this context, it means that they will not cry out to God, even when they are in chains.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-3' href='#cpdv-verse-36-3'>c</a>. <span> There is a play on words here: ‘he will save you from the narrow mouth very widely....’ The mouth of oppression is narrow (hard to escape from), but the salvation from God is very wide (easy to obtain). This play on words is lost if the verse is translated less literally: ‘he will save you from oppression very abundantly....’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-4' href='#cpdv-verse-36-4'>d</a>. <span> The meaning of this verse is obscure. God will save you from an oppression that is hard to escape from. He will do so very widely (perhaps this means geographically, i.e. over all the earth; or perhaps it means that it will be a wide road, i.e. an easy to follow salvation). And God will save without regard to the lack of foundation under ‘it,’ referring to the salvation, i.e. it will seem as if that by which God saves has no dependable foundation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-5' href='#cpdv-verse-36-5'>e</a>. <span> The last part of the verse means that, during the respite that follows, you will have abundance (fatness) at your table. The literal translation would be ‘and the respite of your table will be full of fatness.’ But the meaning is that both the respite and the table are ‘yours.’ So the verse can also be correctly translated as: ‘and your respite at table....’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-6' href='#cpdv-verse-36-6'>f</a>. <span> The last phrase is a play off of the first phrase; it could be reworded this way: ‘lay down your greatness and all of your power, with courage and without distress.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-7' href='#cpdv-verse-36-7'>g</a>. <span> This last phrase is translated strictly as ‘about which men have sung;’ but it can be better translated more loosely as ‘yet men have sung its praises.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-36-8' href='#cpdv-verse-36-8'>h</a>. <span> The word ‘cardines’ here refers back to the previous verse, speaking about the clouds as God’s tent. The phrase means that even the oceans are under God’s Providence, or under the limits of his tent.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-37-1' href='#cpdv-verse-37-1'>a</a>. <span> The phrase ‘perfectas scientias’ is probably an idiomatic expression referring to a particular field of knowledge. Consider the English expression ‘the sweet science,’ which refers to boxing. It does not refer to sweet flavor, nor to a science properly speaking. Similarly, the ‘perfect sciences’ or ‘perfect areas of knowledge’ is most likely a figure of speech referring to a field of study, such as the study of weather, and perhaps also the study of the night sky, i.e. of the sun, moon, planets, and stars.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-37-2' href='#cpdv-verse-37-2'>b</a>. <span> This verse is a clear example of the use of sarcasm in Scripture. Eliu is taunting Job by saying sarcastically that they would all be wrapped in darkness if not for the wisdom of Job. Interestingly, on another level, this sarcastic statement by Eliu is true. Job does present wisdom, not in the error that he makes by blaming God, but by the example of his life and his repentance (later in the text) and by the book of Scripture that we have in his name.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-37-3' href='#cpdv-verse-37-3'>c</a>. <span> Literally: “Gold comes from the north, and to God (comes) fearful praise.” But ‘aurum’ can be used figuratively to refer to riches or wealth. Also, the implication is that fearful praise reaches out to God, when riches come from the North. “When riches arrive from the North, give fearful praise to God,” or “Riches arrive from the north, and fearful praise arrives before God.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-37-4' href='#cpdv-verse-37-4'>d</a>. <span> This verse refers to the time of the Antichrist; when he arrives in the kingdom of the South (the Middle East, including Israel), he brings great wealth with him. This marks the start of a fearful time, for which we must still praise God because it is the time predicted in Scripture, the time before the return of the True Christ.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-38-3' href='#cpdv-verse-38-3'>c</a>. <span> In the phrase ‘ostia tenebrosa,’ the word ‘tenebrosa’ is not genitive in case, so a literal translation would be ‘dark doors’ or ‘gloomy doors.’ But a better translation changes the case of the word ‘tenebrosa’ to genitive: ‘the doors of darkness’ or ‘the doors of the darkness.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-38-4' href='#cpdv-verse-38-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘utero’ in Latin does not simply mean ‘womb.’ It is often used to refer to men as well as to women. It is often translated, for men, as ‘belly’ or ‘abdomen.’ However, it has another possible meaning that is not often recognized. It can refer to the generative capability in either a man or a woman, in other words, to the ability to procreate (to conceive a child). In this verse, the word ‘utero’ is used figuratively to refer to God’s ability to create: ‘From whose ability-to-create did the ice proceed?’ Similarly, the word ‘genuit,’ often translated as ‘begot,’ in this context refers instead to God’s ability to create.</span></div>

The word ‘clamorem’ is translated as ‘bellow’ because that word has a dual meaning; it refers to the loud noise of wild animals, or also to a loud noise made by a human being. The phrase ‘multitudinem civitatis’ literally means ‘the multitude of the city,’ but it is better translated loosely as ‘the crowded city.’</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-2' href='#cpdv-verse-41-2'>b</a>. <span> This last phrase seems, if translated in an overly-literal manner, to say, ‘I am afraid of the circle of his teeth.’ But the context is that of God speaking about his creation. Therefore, the correct translation is that God has ‘placed fear in the circle of his teeth,’ or, ‘given dread to the circle of his teeth,’ or, ‘gave fear to the circle of his teeth.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-3' href='#cpdv-verse-41-3'>c</a>. <span> Or, ‘In his neck strength will dwell, and extreme poverty precedes his face.’ Notice that ‘morabitur’ is future tense but can be translated just as well in the present tense in English.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-4' href='#cpdv-verse-41-4'>d</a>. <span> By the way, this passage about the Behemoth is a poetic and prophetic description of the beast described in the book of Revelation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-5' href='#cpdv-verse-41-5'>e</a>. <span> This first phrase could be translated as, ‘The parts of his body cling together.’ This refers to the different parts of the ‘body’ which is the Antichrist’s kingdom. The other possible translation, ‘The parts of his body work in harmony together,’ is more meaningful, both in the literal and the figurative connotations.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-6' href='#cpdv-verse-41-6'>f</a>. <span> Literally, the phrase is “being terrified,” but English is more likely to phrase it something like “because they are terrified.” This verse could refer to the attempted false ascension by the Antichrist near the end of his reign.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-41-7' href='#cpdv-verse-41-7'>g</a>. <span> Here again Scripture is referring to the Antichrist. The translation of ‘quæ comparetur ei’ should therefore be ‘that is being compared to him,’ rather than ‘can be compared to him.’ For Christ still dwells, even during that future evil time, in the world in the form of the Eucharist (rare though it is on earth at that time). So, the statement that nothing on earth is being compared to the Antichrist is a true statement, but the statement that nothing on earth can be compared to the Antichrist would be a false statement.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-42-1' href='#cpdv-verse-42-1'>a</a>. <span> Job names one of his daughters ‘Daylight.’ Another daughter is named after a rare spice, ‘Cinnamon.’ Cassia refers to the spice, cinnamon, rare in that part of the world at that time, since it originates in China.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-42-2' href='#cpdv-verse-42-2'>b</a>. <span> The name of the third daughter is two Latin words joined together: Cornu-stibii, literally meaning, ‘horn of antimony’ (an ingredient in make-up). In Hebrew, the name is rendered ‘keren-happuch,’ which means ‘horn of cosmetics.’ The name indicates this daughter’s beauty, but also her affinity for displaying her beauty by the use of cosmetics. It is a complement with an edge (or a built-in criticism). Thus, Cornustibii (Horn of Cosmetics) could also be rendered as ‘container of make-up,’ or, much more loosely, ‘make-up girl’ or ‘cosmetics girl.’ But the intention of Job was most likely a complement with an edge, not an insult, so another loose translation would be ‘Horn of Beauty.’</span></div>
