<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it happened that the Lord spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and he said to him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“Moses, my servant, has died. Rise up, and cross this Jordan, you and all the people with you, into the land which I will give to the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I will deliver to you every place that the step of your foot will tread upon, just as I said to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>From the desert and from Lebanon, even to the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, as far as the great sea opposite the setting of the sun, shall be your border.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>No one will be able to resist you during all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so will I be with you. I will not leave you, nor will I forsake you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Be strengthened and be steadfast. For you shall divide by lot, to this people, the land about which I swore to their fathers that I would deliver it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, be strengthened and be very steadfast, so that you may observe and accomplish the entire law, which Moses, my servant, instructed to you. You may not turn aside from it to the right, nor to the left. So may you understand all that you should do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The book of this law shall not depart from your mouth. Instead, you shall meditate upon it, day and night, so that you may observe and do all the things that are written in it. Then you shall direct your way and understand it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Behold, I am instructing you. Be strengthened, and be steadfast. Do not dread, and do not fear. For the Lord your God is with you in all things, wherever you may go.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Joshua instructed the leaders of the people, saying: “Cross through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>‘Prepare your food supplies. For after the third day, you shall cross the Jordan, and you shall enter so as to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give to you.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Likewise, he said to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the one half tribe of Manasseh:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Your wives and sons, as well as the cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses delivered to you beyond the Jordan.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>until the Lord gives rest to your brothers, just as he has given to you, and until they also possess the land, which the Lord your God will give to them. And so shall you be returned to the land of your possession.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they responded to Joshua, and they said: “All that you have instructed to us, we shall do. And wherever you will send us, we shall go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so shall we obey you also. But may the Lord your God be with you, just as he was with Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Whoever will contradict your mouth, and whoever will not obey all of your words, which you will instruct to him, let him die. But may you be strengthened, and may you act manfully.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men from Shittim to explore in secret. And he said to them, “Go and consider the land and the city of Jericho.” And while traveling, they entered into the house of a harlot woman named Rahab, and they rested with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And it was reported to the king of Jericho, and it was said: “Behold, men have entered to this place in the night, from the sons of Israel, so that they might explore the land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: “Bring out the men who came to you, and who entered into your house. For certainly they are spies, and they have arrived to consider the entire land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the woman, taking the men, hid them. And she said: “I admit that they came to me, but I did not know where they were from.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when the gate was closed, they went out together in the darkness. I do not know where they have gone. Pursue them quickly, and you will overtake them.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But she caused the men to ascend to the roof of her house, and she covered them with the stalks of flax that were there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But those who had been sent pursued after them along the way that leads to the ford of the Jordan. And as soon as they went out, the gate was closed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Those who were hiding had not yet fallen asleep, and behold, the woman went up to them, and she said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>“I know that the Lord has given this land to you. For the terror of you has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have languished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea upon your arrival, when you were departing from Egypt, and we heard of the things that you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And upon hearing these things, we were very afraid, and our heart languished. Neither did there remain in us any spirit at your arrival. For the Lord your God is the very God in heaven above and on earth below.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now, therefore, swear to me by the Lord that in the same way that I have acted with mercy toward you, so also shall you act toward the house of my father. And may you give me a true sign</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>that you will save my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that is theirs, and that you may rescue our souls from death.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They responded to her: “May our lives be yours unto death, if only you do not betray us. And when the Lord will have delivered the land to us, we will act toward you with mercy and truth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, she sent them down from a window with a rope. For her house was joined to the wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she said to them: “Climb up to the mountains; otherwise, they may meet you as they are returning. And lay hidden there for three days, until they return. And then you will go on your way.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they said to her: “We shall be innocent of this oath, to which you have sworn us,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Whoever will have exited from the door of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be uninvolved.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But if you will have betrayed us, so that you spread this word in their midst, we will be free from this oath, to which you have sworn us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she responded, “Just as you have spoken, so let it be done.” And sending them to travel on, she hung the scarlet cord at the window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And truly, walking on, they arrived at the mountains, and they stayed there for three days, until those who had been pursuing them returned. For having sought them along the entire way, they did not find them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when they returned and entered the city, the explorers descended from the mountain.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they said, “The Lord has delivered this entire land into our hands, and all its inhabitants have been struck down by fear.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and they began to proclaim: “When you will see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the stock of Levi carrying it, you also shall rise up and follow those who are going before you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Joshua said to the people: “Be sanctified. For tomorrow the Lord will accomplish miracles among you.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Joshua: “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that, just as I was with Moses, so also am I with you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121-6-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Joshua, the son of Nun, called the priests, and he said to them, “Take the ark of the covenant, and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and advance before the ark of the Lord.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-220-9-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>“Perhaps instead, you live in the land which ought to be ours by lot, and we would be unable to form a pact with you.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-227-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And so they accepted this, because of their provisions, and they did not consult the mouth of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-245-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>he was very afraid. For Gibeon was a great city, and was one of the royal cities, and was greater than the town of Ai, and all its warriors were very strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-246-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, the king of Hebron, and to Piram, the king of Jarmuth, and also to Japhia, the king of Lachish, and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-247-10-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>“Ascend to me, and bring troops, so that we may fight against Gibeon. For it has fled over to Joshua and the sons of Israel.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-249-10-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But the inhabitants of the city of Gibeon, when it was besieged, sent to Joshua, who was then staying in the camp at Gilgal.

Some type of miracle occurred, so that the sun and moon appeared to remain in the same place in the sky, but we are not told exactly how this was accomplished.
