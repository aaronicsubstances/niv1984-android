<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Since, indeed, many have attempted to set in order a narrative of the things that have been completed among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>just as they have been handed on to those of us who from the beginning saw the same and were ministers of the word,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>so it seemed good to me also, having diligently followed everything from the beginning, to write to you, in an orderly manner, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>so that you might know the truthfulness of those words by which you have been instructed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>There was, in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the section of Abijah, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now they were both just before God, progressing in all of the commandments and the justifications of the Lord without blame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both had become advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then it happened that, when he was exercising the priesthood before God, in the order of his section,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>according to the custom of the priesthood, the lot fell so that he would offer incense, entering into the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the entire multitude of the people was praying outside, at the hour of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then there appeared to him an Angel of the Lord, standing at the right of the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And upon seeing him, Zechariah was disturbed, and fear fell over him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But the Angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you. And you shall call his name John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And there will be joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice in his nativity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he will convert many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he will go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah, so that he may turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons, and the incredulous to the prudence of the just, so as to prepare for the Lord a completed people.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Zechariah said to the Angel: “How may I know this? For I am elderly, and my wife is advanced in years.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And in response, the Angel said to him: “I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I have been sent to speak to you, and to proclaim these things to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak, until the day on which these things shall be, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the people were waiting for Zechariah. And they wondered why he was being delayed in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then, when he came out, he was unable to speak to them. And they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, but he remained mute.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And it happened that, after the days of his office were completed, he went away to his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then, after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she hid herself for five months, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>“For the Lord did this for me, at the time when he decided to take away my reproach among men.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then, in the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent by God, to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And upon entering, the Angel said to her: “Hail, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And when she had heard this, she was disturbed by his words, and she considered what kind of greeting this might be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And the Angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and you shall bear a son, and you shall call his name: JESUS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>He will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father. And he will reign in the house of Jacob for eternity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And his kingdom shall have no end.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Mary said to the Angel, “How shall this be done, since I do not know man?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And in response, the Angel said to her: “The Holy Spirit will pass over you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. And because of this also, the Holy One who will be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And behold, your cousin Elizabeth has herself also conceived a son, in her old age. And this is the sixth month for her who is called barren.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then Mary said: “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done to me according to your word.” And the Angel departed from her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And in those days, Mary, rising up, traveled quickly into the hill country, to a city of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And she entered into the house of Zechariah, and she greeted Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And it happened that, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And she cried out with a loud voice and said: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And how does this concern me, so that the mother of my Lord would come to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>For behold, as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And blessed are you who believed, for the things that were spoken to you by the Lord shall be accomplished.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Mary said: “My soul magnifies the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>For he has looked with favor on the humility of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations shall call me blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>For he who is great has done great things for me, and holy is his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And his mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He has accomplished powerful deeds with his arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their heart.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-1-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of his mercy,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-1-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Then Mary stayed with her for about three months. And she returned to her own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-1-57'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Now the time for Elizabeth to give birth arrived, and she brought forth a son.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-1-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>Then, at once, his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosened, and he spoke, blessing God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-1-65'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>And fear fell upon all of their neighbors. And all these words were made known throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after the first Sabbath of Passover. The first Sabbath of Passover is used as a starting point for counting the seven weeks (and seven Sabbaths) until the Feast of Weeks. The day after the first Sabbath of Passover is day one in that count. (The ancients did not use the concept of zero in counting, but in our way of thinking, the first Sabbath of Passover is zero.) So the first week of the seven weeks ends with the first Sabbath of the seven Sabbaths on day 7. This is the first Sabbath in the count of seven Sabbaths to the Feast of Weeks (which is held on the day after that 7th Sabbath, i.e. the fiftieth day, or Pentecost). So there are two first Sabbaths: the first Sabbath during Passover (the day used to mark the start of the counting toward the Feast of Weeks, which is also called Pentecost) and the first Sabbath after Passover, which is the second first Sabbath.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> This interpretation is proved correct by the interaction between the Pharisees, the disciples, and Jesus. It was against the Law to eat from the standing ripe grain on the first Sabbath during Passover, because not until the next day were the first fruits of the ripe grain offered to God. But on the second first Sabbath it was lawful to eat from the standing ripe grain, because the first fruits had been offered the previous Sunday. The Pharisees object based on an over-extension of the Law against working on the Sabbath, but Luke points out that they had no ground to stand on under the Law since it was the second first Sabbath.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-331-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they had come to Jesus, they petitioned him anxiously, saying to him: “He is worthy that you should provide this to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-332-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For he loves our nation, and he has built a synagogue for us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-333-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying: “Lord, do not trouble yourself. For I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-334-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Because of this, I also did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-335-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-336-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And upon hearing this, Jesus was amazed. And turning to the multitude following him, he said, “Amen I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-337-7-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And those who had been sent, upon returning to the house, found that the servant, who had been sick, was now healthy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-338-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And it happened afterwards that he went to a city, which is called Nain. And his disciples, and an abundant crowd, went with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-339-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then, when he had drawn near to the gate of the city, behold, a deceased person was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-340-7-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when the Lord had seen her, being moved by mercy over her, he said to her, “Do not weep.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-342-7-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the dead youth sat up and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-343-7-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then fear fell over all of them. And they magnified God, saying: “For a great prophet has risen up among us,” and, “For God has visited his people.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-344-7-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And this word about him went out to all of Judea and to the entire surrounding region.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-345-7-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-346-7-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And John called two of his disciples, and he sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you he who is to come, or should we wait for another?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-347-7-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But when the men had come to him, they said: “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying: ‘Are you he who is to come, or should we wait for another?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-348-7-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases and wounds and evil spirits; and to many of the blind, he gave sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-349-7-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And responding, he said to them: “Go and report to John what you have heard and seen: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor are evangelized.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-350-7-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And blessed is anyone who has not taken offense at me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-351-7-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when the messengers of John had withdrawn, he began to speak about John to the crowds. “What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-352-7-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who are in costly apparel and finery are in the houses of kings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-353-7-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Certainly, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-355-7-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For I say to you, among those born of women, no one is greater than the prophet John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-356-7-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And upon hearing this, all the people and the tax collectors justified God, by being baptized with the baptism of John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-357-7-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law despised the counsel of God concerning themselves, by not being baptized by him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-358-7-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then the Lord said: “Therefore, to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they similar?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-363-7-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then certain Pharisees petitioned him, so that they might eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and he reclined at table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-364-7-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner, found out that he was reclining at table in the house of the Pharisee, so she brought an alabaster container of ointment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-365-7-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And standing behind him, beside his feet, she began to wash his feet with tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed his feet, and she anointed them with ointment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-366-7-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Then the Pharisee, who had invited him, upon seeing this, spoke within himself, saying, “This man, if he were a prophet, would certainly know who and what kind of woman is this, who is touching him: that she is a sinner.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-367-7-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And in response, Jesus said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Speak, Teacher.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-368-7-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>“A certain creditor had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-370-7-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>In response, Simon said, “I suppose that it is he to whom he forgave the most.” And he said to him, “You have judged correctly.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-371-7-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon: “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-372-7-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>You gave no kiss to me. But she, from the time that she entered, has not ceased to kiss my feet.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-380-8-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it happened afterwards that he was making a journey through the cities and towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-381-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>along with certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had departed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-382-8-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who were ministering to him from their resources.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-383-8-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then, when a very numerous crowd was gathering together and hurrying from the cities to him, he spoke using a comparison:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-384-8-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>“The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell beside the way; and it was trampled and the birds of the air devoured it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-385-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And some fell upon rock; and having sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-386-8-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns, rising up with it, suffocated it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-387-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And some fell upon good soil; and having sprung up, it produced fruit one hundredfold.” As he said these things, he cried out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-388-8-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then his disciples questioned him as to what this parable might mean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-389-8-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he said to them: “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-390-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-405-8-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-406-8-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when he had gone out to the land, a certain man met him, who had now had a demon for a long time. And he did not wear clothes, nor did he stay in a house, but among the sepulchers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-407-8-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him. And crying out in a loud voice, he said: “What is there between me and you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408-8-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For he was ordering the unclean spirit to depart from the man.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-409-8-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then Jesus questioned him, saying, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-410-8-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And they petitioned him not to order them to go into the abyss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-411-8-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And in that place, there was a herd of many swine, pasturing on the mountain. And they petitioned him to permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-415-8-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then those who had seen this also reported to them how he had been healed from the legion.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-424-8-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And Jesus said, “Who is it that touched me?” But as everyone was denying it, Peter, and those who were with him, said: “Teacher, the crowd hems you in and presses upon you, and yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-425-8-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Jesus said: “Someone has touched me. For I know that power has gone out from me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-426-8-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Then the woman, upon seeing that she was not hidden, came forward, trembling, and she fell down before his feet.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-15-1' href='#cpdv-verse-15-1'>a</a>. <span> The story of the return of the Prodigal son is a prophecy in Scripture of the return of the Protestant Churches to unity with the Catholic Church. This return begins during a great famine; the famine ends only when the Protestant Churches unite with the Catholic Church. This verse, and the symbol of the ‘first robe’ indicates that the formerly-Protestant branches of the Catholic Church will have one of their members chosen as a true Pope of the Catholic Church. The symbol of the ring indicates that they will have members chosen as Bishops, and the symbol of the shoes indicates that they will have members chosen as priests and missionaries. This Pope, who will not be Roman Catholic, but will be from one of the new branches of the Catholic Church (from one of the formerly Protestant Churches), will be elected about the year 2022.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-15-2' href='#cpdv-verse-15-2'>b</a>. <span> In my speculative eschatology, this interaction between the elder son and the father is a prophecy in Scripture of a future Ecumenical Council, which will decide the questions of whether the Protestant Churches should have been united with the Catholic Church, and of how they should be united. The Council will decide that the unification of the Protestant Churches with the Catholic Church was necessary and just and pleasing to God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-862-18-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now he also told them a parable, that we should continually pray and not cease,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-864-18-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But there was a certain widow in that city, and she went to him, saying, ‘Vindicate me from my adversary.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-865-18-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he refused to do so for a long time. But afterwards, he said within himself: ‘Even though I do not fear God, nor respect man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-866-18-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>yet because this widow is pestering me, I will vindicate her, lest by returning, she may, in the end, wear me out.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-867-18-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the Lord said: “Listen to what the unjust judge said.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-871-18-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now about certain persons who consider themselves to be just, while disdaining others, he told also this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-872-18-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>“Two men ascended to the temple, in order to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-876-18-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I say to you, this one descended to his house justified, but not the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-887-18-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Jesus, seeing him brought to sorrow, said: “How difficult it is for those who have money to enter into the kingdom of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-888-18-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a wealthy man to enter into the kingdom of God.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-894-18-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Jesus took the twelve aside, and he said to them: “Behold, we are ascending to Jerusalem, and everything shall be completed which was written by the prophets about the Son of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-895-18-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles, and he will be mocked and scourged and spit upon.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-1' href='#cpdv-verse-18-1'>a</a>. <span> This last part is not saying that God is patient. It is a common error among translators to interpret an obscure verse as having a meaning that is uninformative and excessively simplified, rather than to clarify the true meaning of the verse, or to leave it obscure. We already know that God is patient. The point of the parable is not that God is patient, but rather that, if you pester God enough for something, He will  give it to you, rather than continue to endure your complaints.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-23-3' href='#cpdv-verse-23-3'>c</a>. <span> We know from the Gospel of Mark that the centurion was not merely saying that Jesus was a good man or a just man, but the Son of God. Some might argue that the centurion lacked true faith, and was merely remarking on Jesus’ innocence, that he was just, but not the Son of God. But the Romans believed in gods and sons of gods, so the centurion had a basic understanding that God can have a Son. And a Roman soldier stationed in Judea would certainly be aware of the controversies among the inhabitants. So he knew that many believed in Jesus as the Son of God, and he also knew that this was the controversy over which he was killed. Then, knowing all this, upon seeing the very act of Christ dying for our salvation, which effects the salvation of all, his comment was not merely that Jesus was innocent. For Christ was only innocent of the charges, if He is the Son of God and the Just One. If Jesus were merely a just man, or a son of God as all men are sons of God, then He would not be innocent. Therefore, the Soldier was saying that this man Jesus was truly the Son of God, the Just One.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1190-24'>Luke 24</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1191-24-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, on the first Sabbath, at very first light, they went to the tomb, carrying the aromatic spices that they had prepared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1192-24-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1193-24-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And upon entering, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1194-24-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And it happened that, while their minds were still confused about this, behold, two men stood beside them, in shining apparel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1195-24-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then, since they were afraid and were turning their faces toward the ground, these two said to them: “Why do you seek the living with the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1196-24-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He is not here, for he has risen. Recall how he spoke to you, when he was still in Galilee,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1197-24-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>saying: ‘For the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1198-24-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they called to mind his words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1199-24-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1200-24-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women who were with them, who told these things to the Apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1201-24-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But these words seemed to them a delusion. And so they did not believe them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1202-24-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But Peter, rising up, ran to the tomb. And stooping down, he saw the linen cloths positioned alone, and he went away wondering to himself about what had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1203-24-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And behold, two of them went out, on the same day, to a town named Emmaus, which was the distance of sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1204-24-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they spoke to one another about all of these things that had occurred.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1205-24-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And it happened that, while they were speculating and questioning within themselves, Jesus himself, drawing near, traveled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1206-24-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But their eyes were restrained, so that they would not recognize him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1207-24-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he said to them, “What are these words, which you are discussing with one another, as you walk and are sad?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1208-24-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, responded by saying to him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1209-24-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And he said to them, “What things?” And they said, “About Jesus of Nazareth, who was a noble prophet, powerful in works and in words, before God and all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1210-24-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death. And they crucified him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1211-24-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But we were hoping that he would be the Redeemer of Israel. And now, on top of all this, today is the third day since these things have happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1212-24-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then, too, certain women from among us terrified us. For before daytime, they were at the tomb,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1213-24-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and, having not found his body, they returned, saying that they had even seen a vision of Angels, who said that he is alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1214-24-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And some of us went out to the tomb. And they found it just as the women had said. But truly, they did not find him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1215-24-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he said to them: “How foolish and reluctant in heart you are, to believe everything that has been spoken by the Prophets!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1216-24-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Was not the Christ required to suffer these things, and so enter into his glory?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1217-24-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And beginning from Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted for them, in all the Scriptures, the things that were about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1218-24-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And they drew near to the town where they were going. And he conducted himself so as to go on further.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1219-24-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>But they were insistent with him, saying, “Remain with us, because it is toward evening and now daylight is declining.” And so he entered with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1220-24-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And it happened that, while he was at table with them, he took bread, and he blessed and broke it, and he extended it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1221-24-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1222-24-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they said to one another, “Was not our heart burning within us, while he was speaking on the way, and when he opened the Scriptures to us?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1223-24-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And rising up at that same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1224-24-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>saying: “In truth, the Lord has risen, and he has appeared to Simon.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1225-24-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And they explained the things that were done on the way, and how they had recognized him at the breaking of the bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1226-24-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then, while they were talking about these things, Jesus stood in their midst, And he said to them: “Peace be with you. It is I. Do not be afraid.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1227-24-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Yet truly, they were very disturbed and terrified, supposing that they saw a spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1228-24-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And he said to them: “Why are you disturbed, and why do these thoughts rise up in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1229-24-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Look and touch. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1230-24-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1231-24-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then, while they were still in disbelief and in wonder out of joy, he said, “Do you have anything here to eat?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1232-24-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And they offered him a piece of roasted fish and a honeycomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1233-24-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And when he had eaten these in their sight, taking up what was left, he gave it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1234-24-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And he said to them: “These are the words that I spoke to you when I was still with you, because all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms about me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1235-24-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Then he opened their mind, so that they might understand the Scriptures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1236-24-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And he said to them: “For so it is written, and so it was necessary, for the Christ to suffer and to rise up from the dead on the third day,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1237-24-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>and, in his name, for repentance and the remission of sins to be preached, among all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1238-24-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And you are witnesses of these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1239-24-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And I am sending the Promise of my Father upon you. But you must stay in the city, until such time as you are clothed with power from on high.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1240-24-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then he led them out as far as Bethania. And lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1241-24-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And it happened that, while he was blessing them, he withdrew from them, and he was carried up into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1242-24-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And worshiping, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1243-24-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span></div>
