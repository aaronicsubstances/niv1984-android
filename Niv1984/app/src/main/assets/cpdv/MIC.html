<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The verb ‘calcabit’ implies not merely walking or traveling over the high places of the earth, but tamping them down.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘excelsa’ has a dual meaning. It can mean height, as in elevation, and it can mean height as in excellence. In this verse, in Latin, it means both. Jerusalem is a city built on a hill. Jerusalem is (and represents) also the excellence of faith in God. The translation uses ‘loftiness’ because this English word also has the same dual meaning.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘meretricis’ does not mean ‘prostitute’ but has more of the meaning of a mistress or a kept woman. This distinction is clear in the book of Baruch, where both words are used: {6:10} “Dant autem et ex ipso prostitutis, et meretrices ornant:”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> These two verses contain a play on words in Latin: Pulveris (dust) and Pulchra (beauty) are compared, making a link between the two terms. This play on words between Dust and Beauty does not continue in the English. However, ‘besprinkle’ and ‘bewildered’ is used in compensation, so as to maintain the  connection between those two verses.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> There is also an implicit play on words (depart and departure) in the meaning of the text, which is clearer in English than it is in Latin: “She did not depart, who dwells at the place of departure.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase ‘rapuerunt domos’ could be translated as ‘they have robbed houses’ or ‘they have stolen houses.’ The first meaning seems more likely, until you consider the context of the first part of this verse, that they have desired land and have taken that land by violence. Houses are located on land; valuable land often has houses on it. They have not merely robbed the contents of houses, they have stolen both land and houses.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘depopulatione’ usually is translated as plundering, pillaging, sacking, marauding, ravaging, or laying waste. To the English reader, it would also seem to mean ‘depopulation,’ and this is a correct meaning of the word because it refers to plundering, pillaging, sacking, etc. that is so severe that the land is depopulated.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> Notice that they sing sweetly about a time of terrible suffering that results in a large decrease in population. They are singing sweetly about this disaster because it is the disaster of the tribulation, which will have ended by the time of that song.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> Or, ‘confusion will not overtake them.’ This refers to the casting of the string (or cord) of fate (or lots), a practice analogous to the modern ‘drawing of straws’ or ‘rock, paper, scissors.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> Since ‘tunica’ is contrasted with ‘pallium,’ one refers to the undergarment and the other to the outer garment. The translation ‘converted into war’ is a phrasing intended to capture both the metaphorical and literal meanings.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-1' href='#cpdv-verse-5-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘egressus’ can refer to a place of departure or the act of going forth, but it can also mean a landing place, or a place of arrival or departure. In this case, the one who goes forth to rule Israel is Christ and His landing place on earth is either Bethlehem, or, from another point of view, the womb of the Virgin Mary. Christ first arrives on earth as the Messiah at His Incarnation within the Virgin Mary. And he later departs from the womb and from her side in order to effect our salvation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-2' href='#cpdv-verse-5-2'>b</a>. <span> In another context, ‘iste’ might merely be translated as ‘this,’ as in: ‘this will be our peace.’ But the previous verse of Micah 5:2 is quoted in Matthew 2:6 as referring to Jesus Christ. So the translation in context is ‘this man will be our peace,’ which also follows the Challoner Douay-Rheims text.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-3' href='#cpdv-verse-5-3'>c</a>. <span> Who is Assur or the Assyrian? It is the Antichrist, who will be from Assyria. Also, the name Assur refers to an ancient false god, which makes for a fitting reference to the Antichrist, who claims to be a god. The Antichrist will ‘come into our land’ and ‘trample our borders.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-4' href='#cpdv-verse-5-4'>d</a>. <span> A ‘quadrigas’ is a chariot with four horses, i.e. a powerful vehicle of ancient times. A modern analogy to this vehicle would be either a car or other motor vehicle (with four wheels instead of four horses). Another analogy could be made to vehicles used in war, since chariots were used in war as well as in peace.</span></div>
