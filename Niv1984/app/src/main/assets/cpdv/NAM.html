<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The Lord takes those who are not clean ‘mundans non,’ and he makes them into those who are innocent. The Lord dwells in a tempest and his way is like a whirlwind. This verse is often mistranslated.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> He not only dries out the sea, he also waters the desert.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘pertransibit’ could also be rendered as ‘he will pass through,’ referring to the individual in verse 1:11 (probably referring to the Antichrist). But the expression ‘Thus says the Lord’ seems to start a new topic, so the translation is ‘it will pass over’ or ‘it will cross through.’ In other words, the affliction sent by God is unavoidable, but it will end.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> Here is an example of the use of ‘interficiam,’ which usually refers to the execution of a criminal by one with the authority to put someone to death, instead to refer to one who is in authority who orders the destruction of inanimate objects, as if these were being put to death like criminals. In this case, God is executing these graven images and molten images, ordering their destruction.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> The evangelizer is Christ and the announcer of peace is the Virgin Mary. This passage indicates that both Christ and Mary will return at the end of the Antichrist’s reign. The name “Belial” refers to the Antichrist.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The ‘agitatores’ (drivers) ‘consopiti sunt’ (have been drugged). The verb ‘sopio’ refers, not merely falling asleep at the end of every day, but to something that causes sleep unnaturally, such as a soporific or a blow to the head. The prefix ‘con’ intensifies the meaning of this verb, so that it is clear that the drivers are not merely sleepy, but they have been drugged.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The expression ‘defectio in cunctis renibus’ literally means that there is a weakness or failure in everyone’s kidneys. The kidneys in ancient texts represent not so much the actual internal organ, but the idea of temperament, composure, patience, or the lack of these things, so the text has a general meaning of loss of composure.</span></div>
