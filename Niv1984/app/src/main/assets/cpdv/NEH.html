<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The words of Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. And it happened that, in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, I was in the capital city of Susa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived, he and some men of Judah. And I questioned them about the Jews who had remained and were left behind from the captivity, and about Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when I had heard this manner of words, I sat down, and I wept and mourned for many days. I fasted and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I said: “I beg you, O Lord, God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keeps covenant and mercy with those who love you and who keep your commandments:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We have been seduced by vanity. And we have not kept your commandments and ceremonies and judgments, which you have instructed to your servant Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Remember the word which you commanded to your servant Moses, saying: ‘When you will have transgressed, I will disperse you among the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if you will return to me, and keep my precepts, and do them, even if you will have been led away to the furthest reaches of the heavens, I will gather you from there, and I will lead you back to the place that I have chosen so that my name would dwell there.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And these same are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great strength and by your powerful hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>I beg you, O Lord, may your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who are willing to fear your name. And so, guide your servant today, and grant to him mercy before this man.” For I was the cupbearer of the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king said to me: “Why is your expression sad, though you do not appear to be sick?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the king said to me: “What would you request?” And I prayed to the God of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I said to the king: “If it seems good to the king, and if your servant is pleasing before your face: that you would send me into Judea, to the city of the sepulcher of my father.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the king said to me, with the queen who was sitting beside him: “Until what time will your journey be, and when will you return?” And it was pleasing before the countenance of the king, and so he sent me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And I said to the king: “If it seems good to the king, may he give me letters to the governors of the region beyond the river, so that they may lead me through, until I arrive in Judea,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I went to the governors of the region beyond the river, and I gave them the letters of the king. Now the king had sent with me military leaders and horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Sanballat, a Horonite, and the servant Tobiah, an Ammonite, heard this.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And I arrived at Jerusalem, and I was there for three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I got up in the night, I and a few men with me.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And I departed in the night through the gate of the valley, and before the fountain of the dragon, and toward the dung gate.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And I continued on to the gate of the fountain, and to the aqueduct of the king. And there was no room for the beast on which I was sitting to pass through.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so I climbed up in the night along the torrent, and I considered the wall. And turning back, I went by the gate of the valley, and I returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the magistrates did not know where I had gone, or what I had done.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so I said to them: “You know the affliction in which we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and its gates have been consumed by fire.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And I revealed to them how the hand of my God was with me for good, and the words of the king, which he had spoken to me. And I said: “Let us rise up, and build.” And their hands were strengthened for good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But Sanballat, a Horonite, and the servant Tobiah, an Ammonite, and Geshem, an Arab, heard of it.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And I replied to them a word, and I said to them: “The God of heaven himself is helping us, and we are his servants.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-101-5-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And there occurred a great outcry of the people and their wives against their brothers, the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-102-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And there were those who were saying: “Our sons and our daughters are very many. Let us receive grain as a price for them, and then we may eat and live.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-103-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And there were those who were saying: “Let us offer up our fields and vineyards, and our houses, and then we may receive grain during the famine.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-104-5-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And others were saying: “Let us borrow money for the tribute of the king, and let us surrender our fields and vineyards.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-106-5-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when I had heard their outcry in these words, I was exceedingly angry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-107-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And my heart considered within me. And I rebuked the nobles and the magistrates, and I said to them, “Have you each been exacting usury from your brothers?” And I gathered together a great assembly against them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-108-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And I said to them: “As you know, in accord with what was possible for us, we have redeemed our brothers, the Jews, who had been sold to the Gentiles.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109-5-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I said to them: “The thing that you are doing is not good. Why are you not walking in the fear of our God, so that there may be no reproach against us from our enemies, the Gentiles?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-112-5-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they said: “We will restore it, and we will require nothing from them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114-5-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now from that day, on which the king had ordered me to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of king Artaxerxes, for twelve years, I and my brothers did not eat the yearly allowance that was owed to the governors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-115-5-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the former governors, the ones who had been before me, were a burden to the people, and they took from them bread and wine, and forty shekels of money each day.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-116-5-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>In fact, I preferred to build in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered to do the work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-123-6-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying: “Come, and let us strike a pact together in the villages, on the plain of Ono.” But they were thinking that they would do me harm.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-127-6-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>“It has been heard among the Gentiles, and Geshem has said it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel, and because of this, you are building the wall and thinking to raise yourself as a king over them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-128-6-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>you also have stationed prophets, who preach about you in Jerusalem, saying: ‘There is a king in Judea!’ But the king will hear about these words.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-130-6-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For all these men wished to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would cease. For this reason, I strengthened my hands all the more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131-6-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And I entered into the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, in secret.

One possibility is that one man died with no children, or at least no sons, and his brother, in accord with Mosaic Law, married his widow in order to raise up sons to his brother. So the sons of the second husband of the woman would be attributed to the lineage of both men. This Biblical principle, that biological descent is not necessary for a lineage, is also found in Matthew’s Gospel, where he recounts the lineage of Joseph, even though Jesus is not the biological son of Joseph.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-222-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, Ezra the priest brought the law before the multitude of men and women, and all those who were able to understand, on the first day of the seventh month.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-228-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they read from the book of the law of God, distinctly and plainly, so as to be understood. And when it was read, they did understand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-231-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the Levites caused the people to be silent, saying: “Be quiet. For the day is holy. And do not be sorrowful.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-236-8-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the people went forth and brought.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-237-8-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, the entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made tabernacles and lived in tabernacles.

And in it, there was found written that the Ammonites and the Moabites must not enter the church of God, even for all time,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-410-13-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, and they hired Balaam against them, to curse them. But our God turned the curse into a blessing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-411-13-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now it happened that, when they had heard the law, they separated every foreigner from Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-412-13-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Eliashib, the priest, was over this task; he had been given charge of the treasury of the house of our God, and he was a close relative of Tobiah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-413-13-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he made for himself a large storeroom, and in that place, there was laid before him gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the gatekeepers, and the first-fruits of the priests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-414-13-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But during all this, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon, I went to the king, and at the end of some days, I petitioned the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-415-13-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And I went to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, such that he would make him a storeroom in the vestibules of the house of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-416-13-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And it seemed to me very evil. And I cast the vessels of the house of Tobiah outside of the storeroom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-417-13-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I gave instructions, and they cleansed again the storeroom. And I brought back, into that place, the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-418-13-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And I realized that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, and that each one had fled into his own region, from the Levites, and from the singing men, and from those who were ministering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-419-13-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And I brought the case before the magistrates, and I said, “Why have we forsaken the house of God?” And I gathered them together, and I caused them to stand at their stations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-420-13-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And all of Judah brought the tithes of the grain, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-421-13-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And we appointed over the storehouses, Shelemiah, the priest, and Zadok, the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites, and next to them Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah. For they had proven to be faithful. And so the portions of their brothers were entrusted to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-422-13-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Remember me, O my God, because of this, and may you not wipe away my acts of compassion, which I have done for the house of my God and for his ceremonies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-423-13-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In those days, I saw, in Judah, some who were treading the presses on the Sabbath, and who were carrying sheaves, and placing on donkeys burdens of wine, and of grapes, and of figs, and all manner of burdens, and who were bringing these into Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I contended with them, so that they would sell on a day when it was permitted to sell.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-424-13-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And some Tyrians dwelt within, who were bringing fish and all kinds of items for sale. And they were selling on the Sabbaths to the sons of Judah in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-425-13-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And I put the nobles of Judah under oath, and I said to them: “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-426-13-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Did not our fathers do these things, and so our God brought all this evil upon us and upon this city? And you are adding more wrath upon Israel by violating the Sabbath!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-427-13-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And it happened that, when the gates of Jerusalem had rested on the day of the Sabbath, I spoke, and they closed the gates. And I instructed that they should not open them until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my servants over the gates, so that no one would carry in a burden on the day of the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-428-13-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And so the merchants and those who sold all kinds of items remained just outside of Jerusalem, once and again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-429-13-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And I contended with them, and I said to them: “Why are you remaining just beyond the wall? If you do this again, I will send hands upon you.” And so, from that time, they no longer came on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-430-13-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>I also spoke to the Levites, so that they would be cleansed, and would arrive to guard the gates and to sanctify the day of the Sabbath. Because of this also, O my God, remember me and spare me, in accord with the multitude of your mercies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-431-13-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But also in those days, I saw some Jews taking wives from the Ashdodites, and the Ammonites, and the Moabites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-432-13-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And their sons spoke partly in the speech of Ashdod, and they did not know how to speak the Jewish language, and they were speaking according to the language of one people or another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-433-13-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And I put them under oath, and I cursed them. And I struck some of their men, and I shaved off their hair, and I made them swear to God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-434-13-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>“Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin in this kind of thing? And certainly, among many nations, there was no king similar to him, and he was beloved of his God, and God set him as king over all of Israel. And yet foreign women led even him into sin!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-435-13-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So how could we disobey and do all this great evil, so that we would transgress against our God, and take foreign wives?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-436-13-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the high priest, was a son-in-law to Sanballat, a Horonite, and I made him flee from me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-437-13-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>O Lord, my God, remember against those who defile the priesthood and the law of the priests and the Levites!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-438-13-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And so I cleansed them from all foreigners, and I established the orders of the priests and the Levites, each one in his ministry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-439-13-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>O my God, remember me also, for good, because of the offering of wood, at the appointed times, and because of the first-fruits. Amen.</span></div>
