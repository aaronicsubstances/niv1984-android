<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> More than one tribe is given the duty of keeping watch over the Sanctuary, perhaps because a watch was needed on all four sides.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> The total number of Levites was actually 22,300; but the number reported as the total was 22,000. This may be due to rounding: the numbers 7,500 and 8,600 and 6200 are probably rounded to the nearest hundred; then, the 22,300 is rounded down to the nearest thousand. Getting an exact number in a census of a very large group is very difficult. Some children are passing their first month, so they enter into the count of the census; some persons die as the census is taking place. It might take weeks or months to take a census, especially since their main occupation in the desert of Sinai was tasks needed to survive. It may also be that these numbers are symbolic; 100 is subtracted from each of the three tribes (300) to make 22,000.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> Notice that the number of the sons of Israel, 20 years and older, excluding the Levites, is 603,550 men; but the number of the first born males one month and older is only 22,273. This is one first born for every 27 or so males of 20 years and up, so that would be an even greater proportion if we knew how many males were between one month and 20 years. In ancient times, and up until the early 20th century, the mortality rate for infants and children was high. In human history, most persons died in childhood, until the 20th century. So the number of surviving first born sons is low.</span></div>

Miriam speaks as if she were equal to Moses in his role over Israel, just as some women speak as if they could be ordained as priests or Bishops, or as if it could ever be God’s will for them to lead men. God rebukes Aaron and Miriam for disdaining the roles given to each of them by God and for desiring a role not given to them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-652-16-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And speaking to Korah, and to the entire multitude, he said: “In the morning, the Lord will cause it to be known who belongs to him, and which holy ones he will join to himself.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-653-16-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, do this: Each one of you, Korah and all your associates, take your censer,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-673-16-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and he said to the crowd, “Withdraw from the tabernacles of these impious men, and touch nothing which pertains to them, lest you become involved in their sins.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-674-16-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when they had withdrawn from their tents all around, Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their pavilions, with their wives and children, and with all their associates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-675-16-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Moses said: “By this shall you know that the Lord has sent me to do all that you discern, and that I have not brought these things out of my own heart:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-678-16-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, as soon as he had ceased to speak, the earth broke open under their feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-679-16-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And opening its mouth, it devoured them with their tabernacles and their entire substance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-682-16-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Yet truly, all of Israel, which was standing all around, took flight at the clamor of those who were perishing, saying, “Lest perhaps the earth may swallow us whole also.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-683-16-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then, too, a fire, going forth from the Lord, put to death the two hundred fifty men who were offering the incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-684-16-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-685-16-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>“Instruct Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take up the censers which lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire to one side and another, because they were sanctified</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-687-16-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Therefore, Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, by which those whom the burning devoured had made an offering, and he formed them into plates, affixing them to the altar,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-689-16-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then, the following day, the entire multitude of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: “You have put to death the people of the Lord.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-691-16-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant. But after they had entered it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-695-16-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When Aaron had done this, and he had run into the midst of the multitude, which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-696-16-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the people, and the scourge ceased.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-698-16-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, after the destruction quieted.</span></div>

The former does not fit this verse because the form refers to the flowers, once their petals have opened, not to the petals themselves. Also, it seems that it would not be worthy of a remark by Scripture if it was merely the case that the petals had an almond shape. But if these are almond tree blossoms, then there may be a symbolic meaning (since almond trees are mentioned elsewhere in Scripture (Genesis, Ecclesiastes).</span></div>

This passage refers to the same event as Daniel 11:29-30; the middle of the Antichrist’s reign, when some Roman Catholics in Greek warships (i.e. from a democratic or formerly-democratic nation) will come against the fleet of the Antichrist. The reference to Italy has the spiritual meaning of indicating Roman Catholics, because Italy and Rome is the seat of authority of the Church. They shall overcome the Assyrians (the fleet of the Antichrist, who will be from Assyria), and also will devastate the Hebrews. The Hebrews, at that time, will be in support of the Antichrist. But notice that they are called Hebrews, not Jews. Those who are truly devout Jews will reject the Antichrist. Later, when the Antichrist is thrown down by the Archangel Michael, many of these Hebrews repent and believe in Jesus Christ. After the Antichrist is defeated in this battle, at a later time, he discovers which Catholics fought against him there and has them killed.</span></div>
