<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Tobit was from the tribe and city of Naphtali (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Asher, after the way, which leads to the west, that has on its left the city of Sephet).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So then, every day, all that he was able to obtain, he bestowed on his fellow captive brothers, who were from his kindred.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And, when he was among the youngest of any in the tribe of Naphtali, he showed not so much as any childish behavior in his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And then, when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made, he alone fled from the company of them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet he continued on to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord, and there he adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his first-fruits and his tithes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So then, in the third year, he administered all his tithes to new converts and to new arrivals.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Truly, when he had become a man, he received as wife Anna of his own tribe, and he conceived a son by her, to whom he assigned his own name.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, when, during the captivity, he had arrived with his wife and son at the city of Nineveh, with all his tribe,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>(even though they all ate from the foods of the Gentiles,) he guarded his soul and never was contaminated with their foods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And because he was mindful of the Lord with his whole heart, God gave him favor in the sight of Shalmaneser the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he gave him the power to go wherever he would want, having the freedom to do whatever he wished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, he continued on to all who were in captivity, and he gave them helpful advice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when he had arrived at Rages, a city of the Medes, he had ten talents of silver, from that which he had been given in honor by the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when, in the midst of the great tumult of his kindred, he saw the destitution of Gabael, who was from his tribe, he loaned him, under a written agreement, the aforementioned weight of silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>In truth, after a long time, Shalmaneser the king died, while Sennacherib his son reigned in his place, and he held a hatred for the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Every day, Tobit traveled through all his own people, and he consoled them, and he distributed to each one as much as he could from his resources.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He nourished the hungry, and he supplied clothes to the naked, and he showed concern for the burial of the dead and of the slain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And then, when king Sennacherib had returned from Judea, fleeing the scourge which God had caused all around him because of his blasphemy, and, being angry, he was slaughtering many from the sons of Israel, Tobit buried their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when it was reported to the king, he ordered him to be slain, and he took away all his belongings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>In truth, Tobit, fleeing with nothing but his son and his wife, was able to remain hidden because many loved him.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-4" id="cpdv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>In truth, after forty-five days, the king was slain by his own sons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>and Tobit was able to return to his house, and all his resources were restored to him.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The Latin text plainly says that Sephet is on the ‘left,’ but the Challoner and the Douay-Rheims versions have this as on the ‘right.’ The Wycliffe version has it as ‘the left.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> In this context, the new arrivals would refer not merely to any stranger or foreigner, but to those who were a new arrival to Jerusalem, who were there to inquire about the Jewish faith. And the new converts would be those one step further in the process of becoming a Jew. The word ‘ministraret’ indicates that Tobit did not merely give away his tithes, but he applied them judiciously to particular persons and circumstances, as needed.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Since Tobit and his son have the same name, editors of various Bible editions have introduced variations on the name, so as to distinguish between the father and his son. In this translation, the father is called ‘Tobit,’ and his son is called, ‘Tobias.’ But actually, they have the same name.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘nudus’ in this context does not mean that Tobit was naked, but that he fled with nothing of his possessions, but only with his wife and son.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In truth, after this, when there was a feast day of the Lord, and a good dinner had been prepared in the house of Tobit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>he said to his son: “Go, and bring some others who fear God from our tribe to feast with us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And after he had gone, returning, he reported to him that one of the sons of Israel, with his throat cut, was lying in the street. And immediately, he leapt from his place reclining at table, left behind his dinner, and went forth with fasting to the body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And taking it up, he carried it in secret to his house, so that, after the sun had set, he might bury him cautiously.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And after he had hidden the body, he chewed his bread with mourning and fear,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>remembering the word that the Lord spoke through the prophet Amos: “Your feast days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Truly, when the sun had set, he went out, and he buried him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Yet all his neighbors argued with him, saying: “Now, an order was given to execute you because of this matter, and you barely escaped a death sentence, and again you are burying the dead?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Tobit, fearing God more than the king, stole away the bodies of the slain and concealed them in his house, and in the middle of the night, he buried them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But it happened one day, being tired from burying the dead, he came into his house, and he threw himself down next to the wall, and he slept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And, as he was sleeping, warm droppings from a swallow’s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And so the Lord permitted this trial to befall him, in order that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, which is even like that of holy Job.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For, even from his infancy, he had always feared God and kept his commandments, so he was not discouraged before God because of the scourge of blindness that had befallen him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But he remained immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For just as kings have mocked blessed Job, so also his relatives and acquaintances ridiculed his life, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In truth, Tobit corrected them, saying: “Do not speak in this way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>for we are the sons of the holy ones, and we look forward to that life which God will give to those who never change in their faith before him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>In truth, his wife Anna went out to weaving work daily, and she brought back the provisions that she was able to obtain by the labor of her hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>At this, his wife, being angry, answered, “Clearly, your hope has become vanity, and the manner of your almsgiving has become apparent.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> This action of taking a fish and dividing it into parts is very similar to the various Old Testament animal sacrifices, which of course have a symbolic meaning. The term 'heart' is still used today in modern English as a symbol. Similarly, the parts of the fish have symbolic meanings. The smoke symbolizes prayer. The heart symbolizes a pure love for God and neighbor. The liver symbolizes the removal of sin from one's life (the liver removes toxins from the body). The gall symbolizes the suffering of self-denial and the healthful effects on the soul of that suffering (since gall is bitter, but was used as a medicine in ancient times). So the parts of the fish represent useful medicines for the soul.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘incenso’ refers to burning something, and, in this context, it calls to mind the burning of incense. So the translation is to burn like incense: somewhat awkward, but more accurate. The first night of continence is to dispel the demons of lust and selfishness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-6' href='#cpdv-verse-6-6'>f</a>. <span> The second night of continence is to prepare the husband and wife to be ready to receive the type of physical union (marital relations) that the holy Patriarchs had in their marriages.

Similarly, when Christ said that ‘this generation’ would not pass away until all was accomplished, he meant ‘this lineage,’ in other words, the human race. He was not saying that the people of that time period would see everything accomplished in their lifetime.</span></div>
