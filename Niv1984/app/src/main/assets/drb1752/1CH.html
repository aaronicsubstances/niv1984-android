<p>THE FIRST BOOK OF PARALIPOMENON<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
These Books are called by the Greek interpreters, Paralipomenon, that is, of things left out, or omitted; because they are a kind of a supplement of such things as were passed over in the books of the Kings.  The Hebrews call them Dibre Haijamim, that is, The words of the days, or The Chronicles.--Not that they are the books which are so often quoted in the Kings, under the title of the words of the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda:  for the books of Paralipomenon were written after the books of Kings:  but because in all probability they have been abridged from those ancient words of the days, by Esdras or some other sacred writer.<br/>

But Sellum the son of Core, the son of Abiasaph, the son of Core, with his brethren and his father's house, the Corites were over the works of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle:  and their families in turns were keepers of the entrance of the camp of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">9:26</span>. To these four Levites were committed the whole number of the porters, and they were over the chambers, and treasures, of the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">9:27</span>. And they abode in their watches round about the temple of the Lord:  that when it was time, they might open the gates in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">9:28</span>. And some of their stock had the charge of the vessels for the ministry:  for the vessels were both brought in and carried out by number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">9:29</span>. Some of them also had the instruments of the sanctuary committed unto them, and the charge of the fine flour, and wine, and oil, and frankincense, and spices.<br/>

Saul is slain for his sins:  he is buried by the men of Jabes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">10:1</span>. Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down wounded in mount Gelboe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">10:2</span>. And the Philistines drew near pursuing after Saul, and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sons of Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">10:3</span>. And the battle grew hard against Saul and the archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">10:4</span>. And Saul said to his armourbearer:  Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me.  But his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear:  so Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">10:5</span>. And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">10:6</span>. So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">10:7</span>. And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in the plains, saw this, they fled:  and Saul and his sons being dead, they forsook their cities, and were scattered up and down:  and the Philistines came, and dwelt in them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">10:8</span>. And the next day the Philistines taking away the spoils of them that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying on mount Gelboe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">10:9</span>. And when they had stripped him, and out off his head, and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be carried about, and shewn in the temples of the idols and to the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">10:10</span>. And his armour they dedicated in the temple of their god, and his head they fastened up in the temple of Dagon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">10:11</span>. And when the men of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to wit, all that the Philistines had done to Saul,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">10:12</span>. All the valiant men of them arose, and took the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabes, and they fasted seven days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">10:13</span>. So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed the commandment of the Lord, which he had commanded, and kept it not:  and moreover consulted also a witch,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">10:14</span>. And trusted not in the Lord:  therefore he slew him, and transferred his kingdom to David the son of Isai.<br/>

David is made king.  He taketh the castle of Sion.  A catalogue of his valiant men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">11:1</span>. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in Hebron, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">11:2</span>. Yesterday also, and the day before when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel:  for the Lord thy God said to thee:  Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">11:3</span>. So all the ancients of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the Lord:  and they anointed him king over Israel according to the word of the Lord which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">11:4</span>. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">11:5</span>. And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David:  Thou shalt not come in here.  But David took the castle of Sion, which is the city of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">11:6</span>. And he said:  Whosoever shall first strike the Jebusites, shall be the head and chief captain.  And Joab the son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the general.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">11:7</span>. And David dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was called the city of David,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">11:8</span>. And he built the city round about from Mello all round, and Joab built the rest of the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">11:9</span>. And David went on growing and increasing, and the Lord of hosts was with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">11:10</span>. These are the chief of the valiant man of David, who helped him to be made king over all Israel, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">11:11</span>. And this is the number of the heroes of David:  Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty:  he lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">11:12</span>. And after him was Eleazar his uncle's son the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">11:13</span>. He was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philistines were gathered to that place to battle:  and the field of that country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">11:14</span>. But these men stood in the midst of the field, and defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a great deliverance to his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">11:15</span>. And three of the thirty captains went down to the rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-458">11:16</span>. And David was in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines in Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">11:17</span>. And David longed, and said:  O that some man would give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the gate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">11:18</span>. And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to drink:  and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">11:19</span>. Saying:  God forbid that I should do this in the sight of my God, and should drink the blood of these men:  for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water.  And therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most valiant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">11:20</span>. And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">11:21</span>. And illustrious among the second three, and their captain:  but yet he attained not to the first three.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">11:22</span>. Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of Cabseel, who had done many acts:  he slew the two ariels of Moab:  and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow.<br/>
<br/>
Two ariels. . .That is, two lions, or lion-like men; for Ariel in Hebrew signifies a lion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">11:23</span>. And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature was of five cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver's beam:  and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">11:24</span>. These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was renowned among the three valiant ones,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">11:25</span>. And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three he attained not:  and David made him of his council.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">12:15</span>. These are they who passed over the Jordan in the first month, when it is used to flow over its banks:  and they put to flight all that dwelt in the valleys both toward the east and toward the west.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">12:16</span>. And there came also of the men of Benjamin, and of Juda to the hold, in which David abode.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">12:17</span>. And David went out to meet them, and said:  If you are come peaceably to me to help me, let my heart be joined to you:  but if you plot against me for my enemies whereas I have no iniquity in my hands, let the God of our fathers see, and judge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">12:18</span>. But the spirit came upon Amasai the chief among thirty, and he said:  We are thine, O David, and for thee, O son of Isai:  peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers.  For thy God helpeth thee.  So David received them, and made them captains of the band.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">12:19</span>. And there were some of Manasses that went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to fight:  but he did not fight with them:  because the lords of the Philistines taking counsel sent him back, saying:  With the danger of our heads he will return to his master Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">12:20</span>. So when he went back to Siceleg, there fled to him of Manasses, Ednas and Jozabad, and Jedihel, and Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and Eliu, and Salathi, captains of thousands in Manasses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">12:21</span>. These helped David against the rovers:  for they were all most valiant men, and were made commanders in the army.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">12:22</span>. Moreover day by day there came some to David to help him till they became a great number, like the army of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">12:23</span>. And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to David, when he was in Hebron, to transfer to him the kingdom of Saul, according to the word of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">12:38</span>. All these men of war well appointed to fight, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:  and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make David king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">12:39</span>. And they were there with David three days eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">12:40</span>. Moreover they that were near them even as far as Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought loaves on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat:  meal, figs, raisins, wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.<br/>

The ark is brought from Cariathiarim.  Oza for touching it is struck dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-533">13:1</span>. David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with all the commanders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">13:2</span>. And he said to all the assembly of Israel:  If it please you; and if the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to us,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-535">13:3</span>. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us:  for we sought it not in the days of Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-536">13:4</span>. And all the multitude answered that it should be so:  for the word pleased all the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">13:5</span>. So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt, even to the entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from Cariathiarim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">13:6</span>. And David went up with all the men of Israel to the hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-539">13:7</span>. And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart out of the house of Abinadab.  And Oza and his brother drove the cart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">13:8</span>. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">13:9</span>. And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark:  for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on one side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">13:10</span>. And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">13:11</span>. And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza:  and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-545">13:13</span>. And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gethite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">13:14</span>. And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three months:  and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had.<br/>

David's house, and children:  his victories over the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-549">14:1</span>. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-550">14:2</span>. And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted over his people Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-551">14:3</span>. And David took other wives in Jerusalem:  and he begot sons, and daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-552">14:4</span>. Now these are the names of them that were born to him in Jerusalem:  Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and Solomon,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-557">14:9</span>. And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the vale of Raphaim.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-559">14:11</span>. And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said:  God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided:  and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">14:12</span>. And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they should be burnt.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-562">14:14</span>. And David consulted God again, and God said to him:  Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon them over against the pear trees.<br/>

David's purpose to build a temple, is rewarded by most ample promises: David's thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-644">17:1</span>. Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet:  Behold I dwell in a house of cedar:  and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-645">17:2</span>. And Nathan said to David:  Do all that is in thy heart:  for God is with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">17:3</span>. Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">17:4</span>. Go, and speak to David my servant:  Thus saith the Lord:  Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">17:5</span>. For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day:  but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-649">17:6</span>. Abiding with all Israel.  Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel whom I charged to feed my people, saying:  Why have you not built me a house of cedar?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-650">17:7</span>. Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-651">17:8</span>. And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone:  and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-652">17:9</span>. And I have given a place my people Israel:  they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-653">17:10</span>. Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies.  And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-654">17:11</span>. And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons:  and I will establish his kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-655">17:12</span>. He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-656">17:13</span>. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son:  and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">17:14</span>. But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">17:15</span>. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">17:16</span>. And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said:  Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-661">17:18</span>. What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">17:19</span>. O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">17:20</span>. O Lord there is none like thee:  and here is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">17:21</span>. For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-665">17:22</span>. And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">17:23</span>. Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-667">17:24</span>. And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever:  and let it be said:  The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-668">17:25</span>. For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house:  and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-669">17:26</span>. And now O Lord, thou art God:  and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-670">17:27</span>. And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee:  for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.<br/>

David's victories.  His chief officers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">18:1</span>. And it came to pass after this, that David defeated the Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out of the hands of the Philistines,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-674">18:2</span>. And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David's servants, and brought him gifts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-675">18:3</span>. At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">18:4</span>. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">18:5</span>. And the Syrians of Damascus came also to help Adarezer king of Soba:  and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">18:6</span>. And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts.  And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">18:7</span>. And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">18:8</span>. Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">18:9</span>. Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">18:10</span>. He sent Adoram his son to king David to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer:  for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">18:11</span>. And all the vessels of gold, and silver and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">18:12</span>. And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">18:13</span>. And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David:  and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">18:14</span>. So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">18:15</span>. And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">18:16</span>. And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests:  and Susa, scribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">18:17</span>. And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi:  and the sons of David were chief about the king.<br/>

The Ammonites abuse David's ambassadors:  both they and their confederates are overthrown.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">19:1</span>. Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">19:2</span>. And David said:  I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour tome.  And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father.  But when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">19:3</span>. The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon:  Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee:  and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">19:4</span>. Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">19:5</span>. And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">19:6</span>. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Soba.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">19:7</span>. And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people.  And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">19:8</span>. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of valiant men:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">19:9</span>. And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city:  and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">19:10</span>. Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">19:11</span>. And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">19:12</span>. And he said:  If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me:  but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will help thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">19:13</span>. Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God:  and the Lord will do that which is good in his sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">19:14</span>. So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the Syrians to the battle:  and he put them to flight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">19:15</span>. And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city:  and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">19:16</span>. But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-708">19:17</span>. And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-709">19:18</span>. But the Syrian fled before Israel:  and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.<br/>
<br/>
Seven thousand chariots. . .That is, of men who fought in chariots.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-710">19:19</span>. And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him:  and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more.<br/>

Rabba is taken.  Other victories over the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">20:1</span>. And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon:  and went and besieged Rabba.  But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-714">20:2</span>. And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it:  he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-715">20:3</span>. And the people that were therein he brought out:  and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces:  in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon:  and he returned with all his people to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-716">20:4</span>. After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines:  in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">20:5</span>. Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">20:6</span>. There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand and foot:  who also was born of the stock of Rapha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">20:7</span>. He reviled Israel:  but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him.  These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants.<br/>

David's sin in numbering the people is punished by a pestilence:  which ceaseth upon his offering sacrifice in the thrashingfloor of Ornan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-722">21:1</span>. And Satan rose up against Israel:  and moved David to number Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">21:2</span>. And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people:  Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">21:3</span>. And Joab answered:  The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are:  but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">21:4</span>. But the king's word rather prevailed:  and Joab departed, and went through all Israel:  and returned to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">21:5</span>. And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed:  and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword:  and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.<br/>
<br/>
The number, etc. . .The difference of the numbers here and 2 Kings 24. is to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">21:6</span>. But Levi and Benjamin he did not number:  for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">21:9</span>. And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">21:11</span>. And when Gad was come to David, he said to him:  Thus saith the Lord:  choose which thou wilt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">21:12</span>. Either three years famine:  or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword:  or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel:  now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.<br/>

Three years famine. . .Which joined with the three foregoing years of famine mentioned, 2 Kings 21. and the seventh year of the land's resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet, 2 Kings 24.13.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">21:13</span>. And David said to Gad:  I am on every side in a great strait:  but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">21:14</span>. So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel.  And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">21:15</span>. And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it:  and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil:  and said to the angel that destroyed:  It is enough, now stop thy hand.  And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
Ornan. . .Otherwise Areuna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">21:16</span>. And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem:  and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">21:17</span>. And David said to God:  Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered?  It is I that have sinned:  it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved?  O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">21:18</span>. And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">21:19</span>. And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">21:20</span>. Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves:  for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">21:21</span>. And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">21:22</span>. And David said to him:  Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord:  but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">21:23</span>. And Ornan said to David:  Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him:  and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice:  I will give it all willingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">21:24</span>. And king David said to him:  It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth:  for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">21:25</span>. So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of just weight.<br/>
<br/>
Six hundred sicles, etc. . .This was the price of the whole place, on which the temple was afterwards built; but the price of the oxen was fifty sicles of silver.  2 Kings 24.24.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">21:26</span>. And he built there an altar to the Lord:  and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">21:27</span>. And the Lord commanded the angel:  and he put up his sword again into the sheath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">21:28</span>. And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">21:29</span>. But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">21:30</span>. And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God:  for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.<br/>

And therefore before his death he prepared all the charges.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">28:20</span>. And David said to Solomon his son:  Act like a man, and take courage, and do:  fear not, and be not dismayed:  for the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">28:21</span>. Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy commandments.<br/>

<p>1 Paralipomenon Chapter 29<br id="bookmark-drb1752-967"/>
<br/>
David by word and example encourageth the princes to contribute liberally to the building of the temple.  His thanksgiving, prayer, and sacrifices:  his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">29:1</span>. And king David said to all the assembly:  Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender:  and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for man, but for God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">29:2</span>. And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house of my God.  Gold for vessels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood:  and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble of Paros in great abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">29:3</span>. Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">29:4</span>. Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir:  and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">29:5</span>. And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold:  and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers:  now if any man is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">29:6</span>. Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king's possessions promised,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-974">29:7</span>. And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids:  of silver ten thousand talents:  and of brass eighteen thousand talents:  and of iron a hundred thousand talents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">29:8</span>. And all they that had stones, gave them to the treasures of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the Gersonite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-976">29:9</span>. And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings willingly:  because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-977">29:10</span>. And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eternity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-978">29:11</span>. Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory:  and to thee is praise:  for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine:  thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">29:12</span>. Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might:  in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">29:13</span>. Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy glorious name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">29:14</span>. Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise thee all these things?  all things are thine:  and we have given thee what we received of thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-982">29:15</span>. For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our fathers.  I Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-983">29:16</span>. O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and all things are thine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-984">29:17</span>. I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things:  and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-985">29:18</span>. O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always for the worship of thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-986">29:19</span>. And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">29:20</span>. And David commanded all the assembly:  Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers:  and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">29:21</span>. And they sacrificed victims to the Lord:  and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">29:22</span>. And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David.  And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, and Sadoc to be high priest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-990">29:23</span>. And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all:  and all Israel obeyed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-991">29:24</span>. And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">29:25</span>. And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel:  and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">29:26</span>. So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">29:27</span>. And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years:  in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">29:28</span>. And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">29:29</span>. Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">29:30</span>. And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.<br/>
