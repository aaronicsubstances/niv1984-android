<p>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
St. Paul, having planted the faithful in Corinth, where he had preached a year and a half and converted a great many, went to Ephesus.  After being there three years, he wrote this first Epistle to the Corinthians and sent it by the same persons, Stephanus, Fortunatus and Achaicus, who had brought their letter to him.  It was written about twenty-four years after our Lord's Ascension and contains several matters appertaining to faith and morals and also to ecclesiastical discipline.<br/>
<br/>
<b>1 Corinthians Chapter 1</b><br/>
<br/>
He reproveth their dissensions about their teachers.  The world was to be saved by preaching of the cross, and not by human wisdom or eloquence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance and in all knowledge;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the days of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. God is faithful:  by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you:  but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. Now this I say, that every one of you saith:  I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Is Christ divided?  Was Paul then crucified for you?  Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And I baptized also the household of Stephanus.  Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:  not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness:  but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. For it is written:  I will destroy the wisdom of the wise:  and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the disputer of this world?  Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. For both the Jews require signs:  and the Greeks seek after wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. But we preach Christ crucified:  unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men:  and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br/>
<br/>
The foolishness, etc. . .That is to say, what appears foolish to the world in the ways of God, is indeed most wise; and what appears weak is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise:  and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen:  and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. That no flesh should glory in his sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. That, as it is written:  He that glorieth may glory in the Lord.</p>

<p><b>1 Corinthians Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-34"/>
<br/>
His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:1</span>. And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:2</span>. For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ:  and him crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:3</span>. And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:4</span>. And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom.  but in shewing of the Spirit and power:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:5</span>. That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:6</span>. Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect:  yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:7</span>. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:8</span>. Which none of the princes of this world knew.  For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:9</span>. But, as it is written:  That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:10</span>. But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit.  For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:11</span>. For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him?  So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:12</span>. Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God:  that we may know the things that are given us from God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:13</span>. Which things also we speak:  not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:14</span>. But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God.  For it is foolishness to him:  and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.<br/>
<br/>
The sensual man--the spiritual man. . .The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only.  Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God.  Whereas the spiritual man is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide:  but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:15</span>. But the spiritual man judgeth all things:  and he himself is judged of no man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:16</span>. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of Christ.<br/>

<br/>
They must not contend about their teachers, who are but God's ministers and accountable to him.  Their works shall be tried by fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:1</span>. And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.  As unto little ones in Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:2</span>. I gave you milk to drink, not meat:  for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able:  for you are yet carnal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:3</span>. For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:4</span>. For while one saith:  I indeed am of Paul:  and another:  I am of Apollo:  are you not men?  What then is Apollo and what is Paul?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:5</span>. The ministers of him whom you have believed:  and to every one as the Lord hath given.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:6</span>. I have planted, Apollo watered:  but God gave the increase.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:7</span>. Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth:  but God that giveth the increase.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:8</span>. Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one.  And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:9</span>. For we are God's coadjutors.  You are God's husbandry:  you are God's building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:10</span>. According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation:  and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:11</span>. For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:12</span>. Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:<br/>
<br/>
Upon this foundation. . .The foundation is Christ and his doctrine:  or the true faith in him, working through charity.  The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser sins.  Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial, (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest of what sort every man's work has been:  of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment.  For then the fire of God's judgment shall try every man's work.  And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:13</span>. Every man's work shall be manifest.  For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire.  And the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:14</span>. If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:15</span>. If any mans work burn, he shall suffer loss:  but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:16</span>. Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:17</span>. But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:18</span>. Let no man deceive himself.  If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:19</span>. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written:  I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:20</span>. And again:  The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:21</span>. Let no man therefore glory in men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:22</span>. For all things are yours, whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:23</span>. And you are Christ's.  And Christ is God's.</p>

God's ministers are not to be judged.  He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:1</span>. Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:2</span>. Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:3</span>. But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man's day.  But neither do I judge my own self.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:4</span>. For I am not conscious to myself of anything.  Yet am I not hereby justified:  but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:5</span>. Therefore, judge not before the time:  until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.  And then shall every man have praise from God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:6</span>. But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes:  that in us you may learn that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:7</span>. For who distinguisheth thee?  Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:8</span>. You are now full:  you are now become rich:  you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:9</span>. For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death.  We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:10</span>. We are fools for Christs sake, but you are wise in Christ:  we are weak, but you are strong:  you are honourable, but we without honour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:11</span>. Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:12</span>. And we labour, working with our own hands.  We are reviled:  and we bless.  We are persecuted:  and we suffer it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:13</span>. We are blasphemed:  and we entreat.  We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">4:15</span>. For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">4:17</span>. For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord.  Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus:  as I teach every where in every church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">4:18</span>. As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">4:19</span>. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will:  and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">6:7</span>. Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another.  Why do you not rather take wrong?  Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?<br/>
<br/>
A fault. . .Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">6:8</span>. But you do wrong and defraud:  and that to your brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">6:9</span>. Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err:  Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:<br/>

<br/>
All things are lawful, etc. . .That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc.  And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">6:13</span>. Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats:  but God shall destroy both it and them.  But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord:  and the Lord for the body.<br/>

<br/>
Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy.  Virginity is preferable to a married state.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">7:1</span>. Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me:  It is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">7:2</span>. But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife:  and let every woman have her own husband.<br/>
<br/>
Have his own wife. . .That is, keep to his wife, which he hath.  His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry:  on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are.  (Ver. <span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">7:8</span>.)  But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">7:3</span>. Let the husband render the debt to his wife:  and the wife also in like manner to the husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">7:4</span>. The wife hath not power of her own body:  but the husband.  And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body:  but the wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">7:5</span>. Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer:  and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">7:6</span>. But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.<br/>
<br/>
By indulgence. . .That is, by a condescension to your weakness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">7:7</span>. For I would that all men were even as myself.  But every one hath his proper gift from God:  one after this manner, and another after that.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">7:8</span>. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows:  It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">7:9</span>. But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry.  For it is better to marry than to be burnt.<br/>
<br/>
If they do not contain, etc. . .This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by vow, have given their first faith to God; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency.  Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, if they cannot contain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">7:10</span>. But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">7:11</span>. And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband.  And let not the husband put away his wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">7:12</span>. For to the rest I speak, not the Lord.  If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him:  let him not put her away.<br/>
<br/>
I speak, not the Lord. . .Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">7:13</span>. And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her:  let her not put away her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">7:14</span>. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean:  but now they are holy.<br/>
<br/>
Is sanctified. . .The meaning is not, that the faith of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation; but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">7:15</span>. But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart.  For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases.  But God hath called us in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">7:16</span>. For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?  Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">7:17</span>. But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one:  so let him walk.  And so in all churches I teach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">7:18</span>. Is any man called, being circumcised?  Let him not procure uncircumcision.  Is any man called in uncircumcision?  Let him not be circumcised.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">7:19</span>. Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing:  but the observance of the commandments of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">7:20</span>. Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">7:21</span>. Wast thou called, being a bondman?  Care not for it:  but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">7:22</span>. For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord.  Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">7:23</span>. You are bought with a price:  be not made the bondslaves of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">7:24</span>. Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">7:25</span>. Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord:  but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">7:26</span>. I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">7:27</span>. Art thou bound to a wife?  Seek not to be loosed.  Art thou loosed from a wife?  Seek not a wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">7:28</span>. But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned.  And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned:  nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh.  But I spare you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:29</span>. This therefore I say, brethren:  The time is short.  It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">7:30</span>. And they that weep, as though they wept not:  and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not:  and they that buy as if they possessed not:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">7:31</span>. And they that use this world, as if they used it not.  For the fashion of this world passeth away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">7:32</span>. But I would have you to be without solicitude.  He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord:  how he may please God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">7:33</span>. But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world:  how he may please his wife.  And he is divided.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">7:34</span>. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord:  that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.  But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world:  how she may please her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">7:35</span>. And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">7:36</span>. But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be:  let him do what he will.  He sinneth not if she marry.<br/>
<br/>
Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc. . .The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will and not sin, provided they afterwards marry; but that the father, with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no sin to him if she marry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">7:37</span>. For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will:  and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">7:38</span>. Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">7:39</span>. A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth:  but if her husband die, she is at liberty.  Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">7:40</span>. But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel.  And I think that I also have the spirit of God.<br/>

Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">8:1</span>. Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols:  we know we all have knowledge.  Knowledge puffeth up:  but charity edifieth.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge puffeth up, etc. . .Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">8:6</span>. Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him:  and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">8:7</span>. But there is not knowledge in every one.  For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol:  and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">8:8</span>. But meat doth not commend us to God.  For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more:  nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">8:9</span>. But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">8:10</span>. For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">8:11</span>. And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?<br/>

A woman, a sister. . .Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife:  whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.<br/>

<br/>
Which we bless. . .Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ.  From whence he infers, ver. 21, that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils by eating of the meats sacrificed to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">10:17</span>. For we, being many, are one bread, one body:  all that partake of one bread.<br/>
<br/>
One bread. . .or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread.  For it is by our communicating with Christ, and with one another, in this blessed sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together.<br/>

Women must have a covering over their heads.  He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">11:2</span>. Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">11:4</span>. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">11:5</span>. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head:  for it is all one as if she were shaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">11:6</span>. For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn.  But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">11:7</span>. The man indeed ought not to cover his head:  because he is the image and glory of God.  But the woman is the glory of the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">11:8</span>. For the man is not of the woman:  but the woman of the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">11:9</span>. For the man was not created for the woman:  but the woman for the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">11:10</span>. Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.<br/>
<br/>
A power. . .that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband:  and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">11:11</span>. But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">11:12</span>. For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">11:13</span>. You yourselves judge.  Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">11:15</span>. But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">11:18</span>. For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you.  And in part I believe it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">11:19</span>. For there must be also heresies:  that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you.<br/>
<br/>
There must be also heresies. . .By reason of the pride and perversity of man's heart; not by God's will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">11:20</span>. When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord's supper. . .So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">11:21</span>. For every one taketh before his own supper to eat.  And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">11:22</span>. What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in?  Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not?  What shall I say to you?  Do I praise you?  In this I praise you not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">11:23</span>. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">11:24</span>. And giving thanks, broke and said:  Take ye and eat:  This is my body, which shall be delivered for you.  This do for the commemoration of me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">11:25</span>. In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood.  This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">11:26</span>. For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">11:27</span>. Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Or drink. . .Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink.<br/>
<br/>
Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc. . .This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord's body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">11:28</span>. But let a man prove himself:  and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice.<br/>
<br/>
Drink of the chalice. . .This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-286">11:29</span>. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">11:30</span>. Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you:  and many sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">11:31</span>. But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-289">11:32</span>. But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-291">11:34</span>. If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment.  And the rest I will set in order, when I come.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-301">12:8</span>. To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom:  and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-302">12:9</span>. To another, faith in the same spirit:  to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-306">12:13</span>. For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free:  and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-348">14:7</span>. Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">14:8</span>. For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">14:9</span>. So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said?  For you shall be speaking into the air.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-351">14:10</span>. There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">14:11</span>. If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian:  and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">14:12</span>. So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.<br/>
<br/>
Of spirits. . .Of spiritual gifts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">14:13</span>. And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">14:14</span>. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth:  but my understanding is without fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">14:15</span>. What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">14:16</span>. Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing?  Because he knoweth not what thou sayest.<br/>
<br/>
Amen. . .The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing.  The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification.  Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">14:17</span>. For thou indeed givest thanks well:  but the other is not edified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-359">14:18</span>. I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-360">14:19</span>. But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also:  than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">14:20</span>. Brethren, do not become children in sense.  But in malice be children:  and in sense be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">14:21</span>. In the law it is written:  In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people:  and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-363">14:22</span>. Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers:  but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-364">14:23</span>. If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">14:24</span>. But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all:  he is judged of all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">14:25</span>. The secrets of his heart are made manifest.  And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">14:26</span>. How is it then, brethren?  When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation:  let all things be done to edification.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">14:27</span>. If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course:  and let one interpret.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">14:28</span>. But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">14:29</span>. And let the prophets speak, two or three:  and let the rest judge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">14:30</span>. But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">14:31</span>. For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">14:32</span>. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">14:33</span>. For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace:  as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">14:34</span>. Let women keep silence in the churches:  for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">14:35</span>. But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home.  For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">14:36</span>. Or did the word of God come out from you?  Or came it only unto you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">14:37</span>. If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">14:38</span>. But if any man know not, he shall not be known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">14:39</span>. Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy:  and forbid not to speak with tongues.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">14:40</span>. But let all things be done decently and according to order.</p>

<p><b>1 Corinthians Chapter 15</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-383"/>
<br/>
Christ's resurrection and ours.  The manner of our resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">15:1</span>. Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">15:2</span>. By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">15:3</span>. For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received:  how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">15:4</span>. And that he was buried:  and that he rose again according to the scriptures:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">15:5</span>. And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">15:6</span>. Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once:  of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">15:7</span>. After that, he was seen by James:  then by all the apostles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">15:8</span>. And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due tine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">15:9</span>. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">15:10</span>. But by the grace of God, I am what I am.  And his grace in me hath not been void:  but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">15:11</span>. For whether I or they, so we preach:  and so you have believed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">15:12</span>. Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">15:13</span>. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">15:14</span>. And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith is also vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">15:15</span>. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God:  because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">15:16</span>. For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">15:17</span>. And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain:  for you are yet in your sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">15:18</span>. Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">15:19</span>. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">15:20</span>. But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">15:21</span>. For by a man came death:  and by a man the resurrection of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">15:22</span>. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">15:23</span>. But every one in his own order:  the firstfruits, Christ:  then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">15:24</span>. Afterwards the end:  when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father:  when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">15:25</span>. For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">15:26</span>. And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last:  For he hath put all things under his feet.  And whereas he saith:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">15:27</span>. All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">15:28</span>. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.<br/>
<br/>
The Son also himself shall be subject unto him. . .That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">15:29</span>. Otherwise, what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all?  Why are they then baptized for them?<br/>
<br/>
That are baptized for the dead. . .Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">15:30</span>. Why also are we in danger every hour?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">15:31</span>. I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">15:32</span>. If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again?  Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.<br/>
<br/>
Let us eat and drink, etc. . .That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">15:33</span>. Be not seduced:  Evil communications corrupt good manners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">15:34</span>. Awake, ye just, and sin not.  For some have not the knowledge of God.  I speak it to your shame.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">15:35</span>. But some man will say:  How do the dead rise again?  Or with what manner of body shall they come?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">15:36</span>. Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">15:37</span>. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be:  but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">15:38</span>. But God giveth it a body as he will:  and to every seed its proper body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">15:39</span>. All flesh is not the same flesh:  but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, other of birds, another of fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">15:40</span>. And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial:  but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">15:41</span>. One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars.  For star differeth from star in glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">15:42</span>. So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption:  it shall rise in incorruption.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">15:43</span>. It is sown in dishonour:  it shall rise in glory.  It is sown in weakness:  it shall rise in power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">15:44</span>. It is sown a natural body:  it shall rise a spiritual body.  If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">15:45</span>. The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">15:46</span>. Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural:  afterwards that which is spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">15:47</span>. The first man was of the earth, earthly:  the second man, from heaven, heavenly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">15:48</span>. Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly:  and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">15:49</span>. Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">15:50</span>. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God:  neither shall corruption possess incorruption.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">15:51</span>. Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">15:52</span>. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible.  And we shall be changed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">15:53</span>. For this corruptible must put on incorruption:  and this mortal must put on immortality.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">15:54</span>. And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:  Death is swallowed up in victory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">15:55</span>. O death, where is thy victory?  O death, where is thy sting?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">15:56</span>. Now the sting of death is sin:  and the power of sin is the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">15:57</span>. But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">15:58</span>. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">16:1</span>. Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints:  as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">16:2</span>. On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him:  that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">16:3</span>. And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">16:7</span>. For I will not see you now by the way:  for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">16:8</span>. But I will tarry at Ephesus, until Pentecost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">16:9</span>. For a great door and evident is opened unto me:  and many adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">16:10</span>. Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear:  for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">16:11</span>. Let no man therefore despise him:  but conduct ye him on his way in peace, that he may come to me.  For I look for him with the brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">16:12</span>. And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren:  and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time.  But he will come when he shall have leisure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">16:13</span>. Watch ye:  stand fast in the faith:  do manfully and be strengthened.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">16:16</span>. That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.<br/>

<br/>
Let him be anathema, maranatha. . .Anathema signifies here a thing accursed.  Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, 'The Lord is come' already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already.  Others explain Maran-atha:  'May our Lord come', that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">16:23</span>. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.<br/>
