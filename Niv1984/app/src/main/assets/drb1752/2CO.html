<p>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
In this Epistle St. Paul comforts those who are now reformed by his admonitions to them in the former and absolves the incestuous man on doing penance, whom he had before excommunicated for his crime.  Hence he treats of true penance and of the dignity of the ministers of the New Testament.  He cautions the faithful against false teachers and the society of infidels.  He gives an account of his sufferings and also of the favours and graces which God hath bestowed on him.  This second Epistle was written in the same year with the first and sent by Titus from some place in Macedonia.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2 Corinthians Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
He speaks of his troubles in Asia.  His not coming to them was not out of levity.  The constancy and sincerity of his doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother:  to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us:  so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation:  or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation:  or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. That our hope for you may be steadfast:  knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation which came to us in Asia:  that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. You helping withal in prayer for us.  That for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. For our glory is this:  the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world:  and more abundantly towards you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known.  And I hope that you shall know unto the end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory:  as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And to pass by you into Macedonia:  and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness?  Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. But God is faithful:  for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not:  It is and It is not.  But, It is, was in him.<br/>
<br/>
It is, was in him. . .There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, It is, and at other times saying, It is not.  But their doctrine was ever the same, one uniform yea, in Jesus Christ, one Amen, that is, one truth in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. For all the promises of God are in him, It is.  Therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ and that hath anointed us, is God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth:  not because we exercise dominion over your faith:  but we are helpers of your joy.  For in faith you stand.<br/>

<br/>
He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:1</span>. But I determined this with myself, to come to you again in sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:2</span>. For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:3</span>. And I wrote this same to you:  that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice:  having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:4</span>. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears:  not that you should be made sorrowful:  but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:5</span>. And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me:  but in part, that I may not burden you all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:6</span>. To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:7</span>. So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:8</span>. Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your charity towards him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:9</span>. For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:10</span>. And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also.  For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ:<br/>
<br/>
I also. . .The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, in the person and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian, whom before he had put under penance, which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:11</span>. That we be not overreached by Satan.  For we are not ignorant of his devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:12</span>. And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:13</span>. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:14</span>. Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:15</span>. For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved and in them that perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:16</span>. To the one indeed the odour of death unto death:  but to the others the odour of life unto life.  And for these things who is so sufficient?<br/>
<br/>
The odour of death, etc. . .The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:17</span>. For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God:  but with sincerity:  but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.<br/>

<br/>
He needs no commendatory letters.  The glory of the ministry of the New Testament.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:1</span>. Do we begin again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:2</span>. You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:3</span>. Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written:  not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:4</span>. And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:5</span>. Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves:  but our sufficiency is from God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:6</span>. Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter but in the spirit.  For the letter killeth:  but the spirit quickeneth.<br/>
<br/>
The letter. . .Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:7</span>. Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious (so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance), which is made void:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:8</span>. How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:9</span>. For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:10</span>. For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:11</span>. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:12</span>. Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:13</span>. And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:14</span>. But their senses were made dull.  For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:15</span>. But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:16</span>. But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:17</span>. Now the Lord is a Spirit.  And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:18</span>. But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.<br/>

The sincerity of his preaching.  His comfort in his afflictions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">4:1</span>. Therefore seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">4:2</span>. But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God:  but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">4:3</span>. And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:4</span>. In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:5</span>. For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord:  and ourselves your servants through Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:6</span>. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:7</span>. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God and not of us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:8</span>. In all things we suffer tribulation:  but are not distressed.  We are straitened:  but are not destitute.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:9</span>. We suffer persecution:  but are not forsaken.  We are cast down: but we perish not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:10</span>. Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:11</span>. For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake: that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:12</span>. So then death worketh in us:  but life in you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:13</span>. But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written:  I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe.  For which cause we speak also:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:14</span>. Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and place us with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:15</span>. For all things are for your sakes:  that the grace, abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:16</span>. For which cause we faint not:  but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:17</span>. For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure, exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:18</span>. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  For the things which are seen are temporal:  but the things which are not seen, are eternal.<br/>

<br/>
He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord.  His charity to the Corinthians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">5:1</span>. For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">5:2</span>. For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">5:3</span>. Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">5:4</span>. For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">5:5</span>. Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">5:6</span>. Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">5:7</span>. (For we walk by faith and not by sight.)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">5:8</span>. But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">5:9</span>. And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">5:10</span>. For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.<br/>
<br/>
The proper things of the body. . .In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">5:11</span>. Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men: but to God we are manifest.  And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">5:12</span>. We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf:  that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">5:13</span>. For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God:  or whether we be sober, it is for you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">5:14</span>. For the charity of Christ presseth us:  judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">5:15</span>. And Christ died for all:  that they also who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">5:16</span>. Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh.  And if we have known Christ according to the flesh:  but now we know him so no longer.<br/>
<br/>
We know no man according to the flesh. . .That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God.  The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">5:17</span>. If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away.  Behold all things are made new.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">5:18</span>. But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">5:19</span>. For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins.  And he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">5:20</span>. For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">5:21</span>. Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us:  that we might be made the justice of God in him.<br/>
<br/>
Sin for us. . .That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin.</p>

The apostle's affection for the Corinthians.  His comfort and joy on their account.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">7:1</span>. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">7:2</span>. Receive us.  We have injured no man:  we have corrupted no man:  we have overreached no man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">7:3</span>. I speak not this to your condemnation.  For we have said before that you are in our hearts:  to die together and to live together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">7:4</span>. Great is my confidence for you:  great is my glorying for you.  I am filled with comfort:  I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">7:5</span>. For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest: but we suffered all tribulation.  Combats without:  fears within.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">7:6</span>. But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">7:7</span>. And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me:  so that I rejoiced the more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">7:8</span>. For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent. And if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">7:9</span>. Now I am glad:  not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance.  For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">7:10</span>. For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation:  but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">7:11</span>. For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you:  yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge.  In all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">7:12</span>. Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it:  but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">7:13</span>. Before God:  therefore we were comforted.  But in our consolation we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">7:14</span>. And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame:  but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">7:15</span>. And his bowels are more abundantly towards you:  remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.<br/>

<br/>
He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">8:1</span>. Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">8:2</span>. That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
Simplicity. . .That is, sincere bounty and charity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">8:3</span>. For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">8:4</span>. With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">8:5</span>. And not as we hoped:  but they gave their own selves, first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">8:6</span>. Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">8:7</span>. That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us:  so in this grace also you may abound.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">8:8</span>. I speak not as commanding:  but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">8:9</span>. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor for your sakes:  that through his poverty you might be rich.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">8:10</span>. And herein I give my advice:  for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">8:11</span>. Now therefore perform ye it also in deed:  that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">8:12</span>. For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath:  not according to that which he hath not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">8:13</span>. For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">8:14</span>. In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want:  that there may be an equality,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">8:15</span>. As it is written:  He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">8:16</span>. And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">8:17</span>. For indeed he accepted the exhortation:  but, being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">8:18</span>. We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">8:19</span>. And not that only:  but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">8:20</span>. Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">8:21</span>. For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also before men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">8:22</span>. And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent:  with much confidence in you,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">8:23</span>. Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">8:24</span>. Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf.<br/>

A further exhortation to almsgiving.  The fruits of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">9:1</span>. For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">9:2</span>. For I know your forward mind:  for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past.  And your emulation hath provoked very many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">9:3</span>. Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">9:4</span>. Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">9:5</span>. Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">9:6</span>. Now this I say:  He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">9:7</span>. Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or of necessity:  for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">9:8</span>. And God is able to make all grace abound in you:  that ye always, having all sufficiently in all things, may abound to every good work,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">9:9</span>. As it is written:  He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor:  his justice remaineth for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">9:10</span>. And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">9:11</span>. That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">9:12</span>. Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">9:13</span>. By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them and unto all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">9:14</span>. And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.<br/>

To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the power of his apostleship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">10:1</span>. Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ:  who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">10:2</span>. But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">10:3</span>. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">10:4</span>. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-194">10:5</span>. And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God:  and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">10:6</span>. And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">10:7</span>. See the things that are according to outward appearance.  If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ's let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">10:8</span>. For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">10:9</span>. But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">10:10</span>. (For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">10:11</span>. Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">10:12</span>. For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves:  but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-202">10:13</span>. But we will not glory beyond our measure:  but according to the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">10:14</span>. For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you.  For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-204">10:15</span>. Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours:  but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-205">10:16</span>. Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel: not to glory in another man's rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">10:17</span>. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br/>

And in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you:  and so I will keep myself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">11:10</span>. The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">12:2</span>. I know a man in Christ:  above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not:  God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">12:3</span>. And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not:  God knoweth):<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">12:4</span>. That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">12:5</span>. For such an one I will glory:  but for myself I will glory nothing but in my infirmities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">12:6</span>. For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the truth.  But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">12:7</span>. And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">12:8</span>. For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">12:9</span>. And he said to me:  My grace is sufficient for thee:  for power is made perfect in infirmity.  Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.<br/>
<br/>
Power is made perfect. . .The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">12:10</span>. For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">12:11</span>. I am become foolish.  You have compelled me:  for I ought to have been commended by you.  For I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">12:12</span>. Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">12:13</span>. For what is there that you have had less than the other churches but that I myself was not burthensome to you?  Pardon me this injury.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">12:14</span>. Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burthensome unto you.  For I seek not the things that are yours, but you.  For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">12:15</span>. But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls: although loving you more, I be loved less.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">12:16</span>. But be it so:  I did not burthen you:  but being crafty, I caught you by guile.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">12:17</span>. Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">12:18</span>. I desired Titus:  and I sent with him a brother.  Did Titus overreach you?  Did we not walk with the same spirit?  Did we not in the same steps?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">12:19</span>. Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you?  We speak before God in Christ:  but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">12:20</span>. For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">12:21</span>. Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you:  and I mourn many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed.<br/>

<p><b>2 Corinthians Chapter 13</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-267"/>
<br/>
He threatens the impenitent, to provoke them to penance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">13:1</span>. Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you:  In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">13:2</span>. I have told before and foretell, as present and now absent, to them that sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">13:3</span>. Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">13:4</span>. For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God.  For we also are weak in him:  but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">13:5</span>. Try your own selves if you be in the faith:  prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">13:6</span>. But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">13:7</span>. Now we pray God that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as reprobates.<br/>
<br/>
Reprobates. . .that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">13:8</span>. For we can do nothing against the truth:  but for the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">13:9</span>. For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong.  This also we pray for, your perfection.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">13:10</span>. Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">13:11</span>. For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace.  And the God of grace and of love shall be with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">13:12</span>. Salute one another with a holy kiss.  All the saints salute you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">13:13</span>. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all.  Amen.<br/>
