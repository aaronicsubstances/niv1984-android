<p>THE FOURTH BOOK OF KINGS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
<b>4 Kings Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Ochozias sendeth to consult Beelzebub:  Elias foretelleth his death:  and causeth fire to come down from heaven, upon two captains and their companies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. And Moab rebelled against Israel, after the death of Achab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and was sick:  and he sent messengers, saying to them:  Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them:  Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Wherefore, thus saith the Lord:  From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die.  And Elias went away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And the messengers turned back to Ochozias.  And he said to them: Why are you come back?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. But they answered him:  A man met us, and said to us:  Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him:  Thus saith the Lord:  Is it because there was no God in Israel, that thou sendest to Beelzebub, the god of Accaron?  Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but thou shalt surely die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And he said to them:  What manner of man was he who met you, and spoke these words?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. But they said:  A hairy man, with a girdle of leather about his loins.  And he said:  It is Elias, the Thesbite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him.  And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, he said to him:  Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty:  If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him.<br/>
<br/>
Let fire, etc. . .Elias was inspired to call for fire from heaven upon these captains, who came to apprehend him; not out of a desire to gratify any private passion; but to punish the insult offered to religion, to confirm his mission, and to shew how vain are the efforts of men against God, and his servants, whom he willeth to protect.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And he again sent to him another captain of fifty men, and his fifty with him.  And he said to him:  Man of God:  Thus saith the king: Make haste and come down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. Elias answering, said:  If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty.  And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Again he sent a third captain of fifty men, and the fifty that were with him.  And when he was come, he fell upon his knees before Elias, and besought him, and said:  Man of God, despise not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two first captains of fifty men, and the fifties that were with them:  but now I beseech thee to spare my life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, saying:  Go down with him, fear not.  He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And said to him:  Thus saith the Lord:  Because thou hast sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, as though there were not a God in Israel, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore, from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. So he died, according to the word of the Lord, which Elias spoke; and Joram, his brother, reigned in his stead, in the second year of Joram, the son of Josaphat, king of Juda, because he had no son.<br/>
<br/>
The second year of Joram, etc. . .Counted from the time that he was associated to the throne by his father Josaphat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. But the rest of the acts of Ochozias, which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-21"/>
</b><br/>
Eliseus will not part from Elias.  The water of the Jordan is divided by Elias' cloak.  Elias is taken up in a fiery chariot, and his double spirit is given to Eliseus.  Eliseus healeth the waters by casting in salt.  Boys are torn by bears for mocking Eliseus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:1</span>. And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias, into heaven, by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven. . .By heaven here is meant the air, the lowest of the heavenly regions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:2</span>. And Elias said to Eliseus:  Stay thou here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel.  And Eliseus said to him:  As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And when they were come down to Bethel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:3</span>. The sons of the prophets, that were at Bethel, came forth to Eliseus, and said to him:  Dost thou know that, this day, the Lord will take away thy master from thee?  And he answered:  I also know it:  hold your peace.<br/>
<br/>
The sons of the prophets. . .That is, the disciples of the prophets; who seem to have had their schools, like colleges or communities, in Bethel, Jericho, and other places in the days of Elias and Eliseus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:4</span>. And Elias said to Eliseus:  Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.  And he said:  As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And when they were come to Jericho,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:5</span>. The sons of the prophets, that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus, and said to him:  Dost thou know that, this day, the Lord will take away thy master from thee?  And he said:  I also know it:  hold your peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:6</span>. And Elias said to him:  Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the Jordan.  And he said:  as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And they two went on together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:7</span>. And fifty men, of the sons of the prophets, followed them, and stood in sight, at a distance:  but they two stood by the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:8</span>. And Elias took his mantle, and folded it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:9</span>. And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus:  Ask what thou wilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.  And Eliseus said:  I beseech thee, that in me may be thy double spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Double spirit. . .A double portion of thy spirit, as the eldest son and heir:  or thy spirit which is double in comparison of that which God usually imparteth to his prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:10</span>. And he answered:  Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked:  but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:11</span>. And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold, a fiery chariot and fiery horses parted them both asunder:  and Elias went up by a whirlwind into heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:12</span>. And Eliseus saw him, and cried:  My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof.  And he saw him no more:  and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:13</span>. And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him:  and going back, he stood on the bank of the Jordan;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:14</span>. And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided.  And he said:  Where is now the God of Elias?  And he struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:15</span>. And the sons of the prophets, at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it, said:  The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus.  And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
They worshipped him. . .viz., with an inferior, yet religious veneration, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:16</span>. And they said to him:  Behold, there are with thy servants, fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest, perhaps, the spirit of the Lord, hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.  And he said:  Do not send.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:17</span>. But they pressed him, till he consented, and said:  Send.  And they sent fifty men:  and they sought three days, but found him not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:18</span>. And they came back to him:  for he abode at Jericho, and he said to them:  Did I not say to you?  Do not send.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:19</span>. And the men of the city, said to Eliseus .  Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest:  but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:20</span>. And he said:  Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it.  And when they had brought it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:21</span>. He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said:  Thus saith the Lord:  I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:22</span>. And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:23</span>. And he went up from thence to Bethel:  and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying:  Go up, thou bald head, go up, thou bald head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:24</span>. And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord:  and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them, two and forty boys.<br/>
<br/>
Cursed them. . .This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet; and of a divine inspiration:  God punishing in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf worship,) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:25</span>. And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 3</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-48"/>
<br/>
The kings of Israel, Juda, and Edom, fight against the king of Moab. They want water, which Eliseus procureth without rain:  and prophesieth victory.  The king of Moab is overthrown, his city is besieged:  he sacrificeth his firstborn son:  so the Israelites raise the siege.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:1</span>. And Joram the son of Achab, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Josaphat, king of Juda.  And he reigned twelve years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:2</span>. And he did evil before the Lord, but not like his father and his mother:  for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:3</span>. Nevertheless, he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he depart from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:4</span>. Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with their fleeces.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:5</span>. And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:6</span>. And king Joram went out that day from Samaria, and mustered all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:7</span>. And he sent to Josaphat; king of Juda, saying:  The king of Moab is revolted from me:  come with me against him to battle.  And he answered: I will come up:  he that is mine, is thine:  my people are thy people: and my horses, thy horses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:8</span>. And he said:  Which way shall we go up?  But he answered:  By the desert of Edom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:9</span>. So the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went, and they fetched a compass of seven days journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:10</span>. And the king of Israel said:  Alas, alas, alas, the Lord hath gathered us three kings together, to deliver us into the hands of Moab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:11</span>. And Josaphat said:  Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may beseech the Lord by him?  And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered:  Here is Eliseus, the son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:12</span>. And Josaphat said:  The word of the Lord is with him.  And the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went down to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:13</span>. And Eliseus said to the king of Israel:  What have I to do with thee?  go to the prophets of thy father, and thy mother.  And the king of Israel said to him:  Why hath the Lord gathered together these three kings, to deliver them into the hands of Moab?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:14</span>. And Eliseus said to him:  As the Lord of hosts liveth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reverence the face of Josaphat, king of Juda, I would not have hearkened to thee, nor looked on thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:15</span>. But now bring me hither a minstrel.  And when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:16</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Make the channel of this torrent full of ditches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:17</span>. For thus saith the Lord:  You shall not see wind, nor rain:  and yet this channel shall be filled with waters, and you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:18</span>. And this is a small thing in the sight of the Lord:  moreover, he will deliver, also, Moab into your hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:19</span>. And you shall destroy every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every fruitful tree, and shall stop up all the springs of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:20</span>. And it came to pass, in the morning, when the sacrifices used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:21</span>. And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:22</span>. And they rose early in the morning, and the sun being now up, and shining upon the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red, like blood,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:23</span>. And they said:  It is the blood of the sword:  the kings have fought among themselves, and they have killed one another:  go now, Moab, to the spoils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:24</span>. And they went into the camp of Israel:  but Israel rising up, defeated Moab, who fled before them.  And they being conquerors, went and smote Moab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:25</span>. And they destroyed the cities:  And they filled every goodly field, every man casting his stone:  and they stopt up all the springs of waters:  and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained:  and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Brick walls only remained. . .It was the proper name of the capital city of the Moabites.  In Hebrew, Kir-Haraseth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:26</span>. And when the king of Moab saw this, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break in upon the king of Edom:  but they could not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:27</span>. Then he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall:  and there was great indignation in Israel, and presently they departed from him, and returned into their own country.<br/>

Miracles of Eliseus.  He raiseth a dead child to life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:1</span>. Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets, cried to Eliseus, saying:  Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:2</span>. And Eliseus said to her:  What wilt thou have me do for thee?  Tell me, what hast thou in thy house?  And she answered:  I, thy handmaid, have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:3</span>. And he said to her:  Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels, not a few.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:4</span>. And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels:  and when they are full, take them away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:5</span>. So the woman went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:6</span>. And when the vessels were full, she said to her son:  Bring me yet a vessel.  And he answered:  I have no more.  And the oil stood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:7</span>. And she came, and told the man of God.  And he said:  Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor:  and thou and thy sons live of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:8</span>. And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam:  now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread:  and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:9</span>. And she said to her husband:  I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who often passeth by us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:10</span>. Let us, therefore, make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us he may abide there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:11</span>. Now, there was a certain day, when he came, and turned into the chamber, and rested there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:12</span>. And he said to Giezi, his servant:  Call this Sunamitess.  And when he had called her, and she stood before him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:13</span>. He said to his servant:  Say to her:  Behold, thou hast diligently served us in all things; what wilt thou have me to do for thee?  Hast thou any business, and wilt thou, that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army?  And she answered:  I dwell in the midst of my own people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:14</span>. And he said:  What will she then that I do for her?  And Giezi said:  Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">4:15</span>. Then he bid him call her.  And when she was called, and stood before the door,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">4:16</span>. He said to her:  At this time, and this same hour, if life be in company, thou shalt have a son in thy womb.  But she answered:  Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">4:17</span>. And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour that Eliseus had said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">4:18</span>. And the child grew.  And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">4:19</span>. He said to his father:  My head acheth, my head acheth.  But he said to his servant.  Take him, and carry him to his mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">4:20</span>. And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she sat him on her knees, until noon, and then he died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">4:21</span>. And she went up, and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door:  and going out,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">4:22</span>. She called her husband, and said:  Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">4:23</span>. And he said to her:  Why dost thou go to him?  to day is neither new moon nor sabbath.  She answered:  I will go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">4:24</span>. And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant:  Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going:  And do that which I bid thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:25</span>. So she went forward, and came to the man of God, to mount Carmel: and when the man of God saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi, his servant:  Behold that Sunamitess.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:26</span>. Go, therefore, to meet her, and say to her:  Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son?  And she answered:  Well.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">4:27</span>. And when she came to the man of God, to the mount, she caught hold on his feet:  and Giezi came to remove her.  And the man of God said:  Let her alone for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">4:28</span>. And she said to him:  Did I ask a son of my lord?  did I not say to thee:  Do not deceive me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">4:29</span>. Then he said to Giezi:  Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go.  If any man meet thee, salute him not:  and if any man salute thee, answer him not:  and lay my staff upon the face of the child.<br/>
<br/>
Salute him not. . .He that is sent to raise to life the sinner spiritually dead, must not suffer himself to be called off, or diverted from his enterprise, by the salutations or ceremonies of the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">4:30</span>. But the mother of the child said:  As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  He arose, therefore, and followed her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">4:31</span>. But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was no voice nor sense:  and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying:  The child is not risen.<br/>
<br/>
St. Augustine considers a great mystery in this miracle wrought by the prophet Eliseus, thus:  By the staff sent by his servant is figured the rod of Moses, or the Old Law, which was not sufficient to bring mankind to life then dead in sin.  It was necessary that Christ himself should come, and by taking on human nature, become flesh of our flesh, and restore us to life.  In this Eliseus was a figure of Christ, as it was necessary that he should come himself to bring the dead child to life and restore him to his mother, who is here, in a mystical sense, a figure of the Church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">4:32</span>. Eliseus, therefore, went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">4:33</span>. And going in, he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">4:34</span>. And he went up, and lay upon the child:  and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh grew warm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">4:35</span>. Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro:  and he went up, and lay upon him:  and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">4:36</span>. And he called Giezi, and said to him:  Call this Sunamitess.  And she being called, went in to him:  and he said:  Take up thy son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">4:37</span>. She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and took up her son, and went out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">4:38</span>. And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him:  And he said to one of his servants:  Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">4:39</span>. And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs:  and he found something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back, he shred them into the pot of pottage; for he knew not what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Wild gourds of the field. . .Colocynthidas.  They are extremely bitter, and therefore are called the gall of the earth; and are poisonous if taken in a great quantity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:40</span>. And they poured it out for their companions to eat:  and when they had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying:  Death is in the pot, O man of God.  And they could not eat thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">4:41</span>. But he said:  Bring some meal.  And when they had brought it, he cast it into the pot, and said:  Pour out for the people, that they may eat.  And there was now no bitterness in the pot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">4:42</span>. And a certain man came from Baalsalisa, bringing to the man of God, bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip.  And he said:  Give to the people, that they may eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">4:43</span>. And his servant answered him:  How much is this, that I should set it before a hundred men?  He said again:  Give to the people, that they may eat:  for thus saith the Lord:  They shall eat, and there shall be left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">4:44</span>. So he set it before them:  and they ate, and there was left, according to the word of the Lord.<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 5<br id="bookmark-drb1752-123"/>
</b><br/>
Naaman the Syrian is cleansed of his leprosy.  He professeth his belief in one God, promising to serve him.  Giezi taketh gifts of Naaman, and is struck with leprosy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:1</span>. Naaman, general of the army, of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable:  for by him the Lord gave deliverance to Syria:  and he was a valiant man, and rich, but a leper.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:2</span>. Now there had gone out robbers from Syria, and had led away captive out of the land of Israel, a little maid, and she waited upon Naaman's wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:3</span>. And she said to her mistress:  I wish my master had been with the prophet that is in Samaria:  he would certainly have healed him of the leprosy which he hath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:4</span>. Then Naaman went in to his lord, and told him, saying:  Thus and thus said the girl from the land of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:5</span>. And the king of Syria said to him:  Go; and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.  And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:6</span>. And brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words:  When thou shalt receive this letter, know that I have sent to thee Naaman, my servant, that thou mayst heal him of his leprosy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:7</span>. And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his garments, and said:  Am I God, to be able to kill and give life, that this man hath sent to me to heal a man of his leprosy?  mark, and see how he seeketh occasions against me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:8</span>. And when Eliseus, the man of God, had heard this, to wit, that the king of Israel had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying:  Why hast thou rent thy garments?  let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:9</span>. So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Eliseus:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">5:10</span>. And Eliseus sent a messenger to him, saying:  Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thou shalt be clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">5:11</span>. Naaman was angry, and went away, saying:  I thought he would have come out to me, and standing, would have invoked the name of the Lord his God, and touched with his hand the place of the leprosy, and healed me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">5:12</span>. Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean?  So as he turned, and was going away with indignation,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">5:13</span>. His servants came to him, and said to him:  Father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, surely thou shouldst have done it: how much rather what he now hath said to thee:  Wash, and thou shalt be clean?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">5:14</span>. Then he went down, and washed in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child:  and he was made clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">5:15</span>. And returning to the man of God, with all his train, he came, and stood before him, and said:  In truth, I know there is no other God, in all the earth, but only in Israel:  I beseech thee, therefore, take a blessing of thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
A blessing. . .a present.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:16</span>. But he answered:  As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.  And when he pressed him, he still refused.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">5:17</span>. And Naaman said:  As thou wilt:  but I beseech thee, grant to me, thy servant, to take from hence two mules' burden of earth:  for thy servant will not henceforth offer holocaust, or victim, to other gods, but to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">5:18</span>. But there is only this, for which thou shalt entreat the Lord for thy servant; when my master goeth into the temple of Remmon, to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand:  if I bow down in the temple of Remmon, when he boweth down in the same place, that the Lord pardon me, thy servant, for this thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">5:19</span>. And he said to him:  Go in peace.  So he departed from him, in the spring time of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Go in peace. . .What the prophet here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an idolatrous worship; but only a service which by his office he owed to his master:  who on all public occasions leaned on him:  so that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down was not in effect adoring the idols:  nor was it so understood by the standers by, since he publicly professed himself a worshipper of the only true and living God, but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king his master, whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:20</span>. But Giezi, the servant of the man of God, said:  My master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving of him that which he brought:  as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take something of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">5:21</span>. And Giezi followed after Naaman:  and when he saw him running after him, he leapt down from his chariot to meet him, and said:  Is all well?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">5:22</span>. And he said:  Well:  my master hath sent me to thee, saying:  Just now there are come to me from mount Ephraim, two young men of the sons of the prophets:  give them a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">5:23</span>. And Naaman said:  It is better that thou take two talents.  And he forced him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they carried them before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">5:24</span>. And when he was come, and now it was the evening, he took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and sent the men away, and they departed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">5:25</span>. But he went in, and stood before his master.  And Eliseus said: Whence comest thou, Giezi?  He answered:  Thy servant went no whither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">5:26</span>. But he said:  Was not my heart present, when the man turned back, from his chariot, to meet thee?  So now thou hast received money, and received garments, to buy oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">5:27</span>. But the leprosy of Naaman, shall also stick to thee, and to thy seed for ever.  And he went out from him a leper, as white as snow.<br/>

Eliseus maketh iron to swim upon the water:  he leadeth the Syrians that were sent to apprehend him into Samaria, where there eyes being opened, they are courteously entertained.  The Syrians besiege Samaria:  the famine there causeth a woman to eat her own child.  Upon this the king commandeth Eliseus to be put to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:1</span>. And the sons of the prophets said to Eliseus:  Behold, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:2</span>. Let us go as far as the Jordan, and take out of the wood every man a piece of timber, that we may build us there a place to dwell in.  And he said:  Go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:3</span>. And one of them said:  But come thou also with thy servants.  He answered:  I will come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:4</span>. So he went with them.  And when they were come to the Jordan, they cut down wood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:5</span>. And it happened, as one was felling some timber, that the head of the ax fell into the water:  and he cried out, and said:  Alas, alas, alas, my lord, for this same was borrowed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">6:6</span>. And the man of God said:  Where did it fall?  and he shewed him the place:  Then he cut off a piece of wood, and cast it in thither:  and the iron swam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">6:7</span>. And he said:  Take it up.  And he put out his hand, and took it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">6:8</span>. And the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying:  In such and such a place, let us lay an ambush.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:9</span>. And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying:  Beware that thou pass not to such a place:  for the Syrians are there in ambush.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:10</span>. And the king of Israel, sent to the place which the man of God had told him, and prevented him, and looked well to himself there not once nor twice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">6:11</span>. And the heart of the king of Syria, was troubled for this thing. And calling together his servants, he said:  Why do you not tell me who it is that betrays me to the king of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">6:12</span>. And one of his servants said:  No one, my lord, O king:  but Eliseus, the prophet, that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel all the words, that thou speakest in thy privy chamber.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">6:13</span>. And he said to them:  Go, and see where he is:  that I may send and take him.  And they told him:  saying:  Behold he is in Dothan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">6:14</span>. Therefore, he sent thither horses, and chariots, and the strength of an army:  and they came by night, and beset the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">6:15</span>. And the servant of the man of God, rising early went out, and saw an army round about the city, and horses and chariots:  and he told him, saying:  Alas, alas, alas, my lord, what shall we do?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">6:16</span>. But he answered:  Fear not:  for there are more with us than with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">6:17</span>. And Eliseus prayed, and said:  Lord, open his eyes, that he may see.  And the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw:  and behold, the mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire round about Eliseus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">6:18</span>. And the enemies came down to him:  but Eliseus prayed to the Lord, saying:  Strike, I beseech thee, this people with blindness:  and the Lord struck them with blindness, according to the word of Eliseus.<br/>
<br/>
Blindness. . .The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different objects to their imagination:  so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of Eliseus; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another man, to Samaria.  So that he truly told them, this is not the way, neither is this the city, etc., because he spoke with relation to the way and to the city, which was represented to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">6:19</span>. And Eliseus said to them:  This is not the way, neither is this the city:  follow me, and I will shew you the man whom you seek.  So he led them into Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">6:20</span>. And when they were come into Samaria, Eliseus said:  Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.  And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw themselves to be in the midst of Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">6:21</span>. And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he saw them:  My father, shall I kill them?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">6:22</span>. And he said:  Thou shalt not kill them:  for thou didst not take them with thy sword, or thy bow, that thou mayst kill them:  but set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">6:23</span>. And a great provision of meats was set before them, and they ate and drank; and he let them go:  and they went away to their master:  and the robbers of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">6:24</span>. And it came to pass, after these things, that Benadad, king of Syria, gathered together all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">6:25</span>. And there was a great famine in Samaria:  and so long did the siege continue, till the head of an ass was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cabe of pigeons' dung, for five pieces of silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">6:26</span>. And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying:  Save me, my lord, O king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">6:27</span>. And he said:  If the Lord doth not save thee, how can I save thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  And the king said to her:  What aileth thee?  And she answered:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">6:28</span>. This woman said to me:  Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">6:29</span>. So we boiled my son, and ate him.  And I said to her on the next day:  Give thy son, that we may eat him.  And she hath hid her son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">6:30</span>. When the king heard this, he rent his garments, and passed by upon the wall.  And all the people saw the haircloth which he wore within next to his flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">6:31</span>. And the king said:  May God do so and so to me, and may he add more, if the head of Eliseus, the son of Saphat, shall stand on him this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">6:32</span>. But Eliseus sat in his house, and the ancients sat with him.  So he sent a man before:  and before that messenger came, he said to the ancients:  Do you know that this son of a murderer hath sent to cut off my head?  Look then when the messenger shall come, shut the door, and suffer him not to come in:  for behold the sound of his master's feet is behind him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">6:33</span>. While he was yet speaking to them, the messenger appeared, who was coming to him.  And he said:  Behold, so great an evil is from the Lord:  what shall I look for more from the Lord?</p>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 7<br id="bookmark-drb1752-187"/>

Eliseus prophesieth a great plenty, which presently ensueth upon the sudden flight of the Syrians; of which four lepers bring the news to the city.  The incredulous nobleman is trod to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">7:1</span>. And Eliseus said:  Hear ye the word of the Lord:  Thus saith the Lord:  Tomorrow, about this time, a bushel of fine flour shall be sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
A stater. . .It is the same as a sicle or shekel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">7:2</span>. Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the man of God, said:  If the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, can that possibly be which thou sayest?  And he said:  Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">7:3</span>. Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate:  and they said one to another:  What mean we to stay here till we die?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">7:4</span>. If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine:  and if we will remain here, we must also die:  come therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the Syrians.  If they spare us, we shall live: but if they kill us, we shall but die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">7:5</span>. So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp.  And when they were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">7:6</span>. For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army:  and they said one to another:  Behold, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hethites, and of the Egyptians; and they are come upon us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-194">7:7</span>. Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">7:8</span>. So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank:  and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it:  and they came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">7:9</span>. Then they said one to another:  We do not well:  for this is a day of good tidings.  If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime:  come, let us go, and tell it in the king's court.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">7:10</span>. So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying:  We went to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents standing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">7:11</span>. Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within in the king's palace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">7:12</span>. And he arose in the night, and said to his servants:  I tell you what the Syrians have done to us:  They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying:  When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">7:13</span>. And one of his servants answered:  Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed), and let us send and see.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">7:14</span>. They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the Syrians, saying:  Go, and see.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-202">7:15</span>. And they went after them, as far as the Jordan:  and behold, all the way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away, in their fright, and the messengers returned, and told the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">7:16</span>. And the people going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians:  and a bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-204">7:17</span>. And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate:  and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-205">7:18</span>. And it came to pass, according to the word of the man of God, which he spoke to the king, when he said:  Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time tomorrow, in the gate of Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">7:19</span>. When that lord answered the man of God, and said:  Although the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which thou sayest?  And he said to him:  Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, and shalt not eat thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">7:20</span>. And so it fell out to him, as it was foretold, and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 8<br id="bookmark-drb1752-209"/>
</b><br/>
After seven years' famine foretold by Eliseus, the Sunamitess returning home, recovereth her lands, and revenues.  Eliseus foresheweth the death of Benadad, king of Syria, and the reign of Hazael.  Joram's wicked reign in Juda.  He dieth, and his son Ochozias succeedeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">8:1</span>.And Eliseus spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying:  Arise, and go thou, and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst find:  for the Lord hath called a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">8:2</span>. And she arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">8:3</span>. And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house and for her lands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">8:4</span>. And the king talked with Giezi, the servant of the man of God, saying:  Tell me all the great things that Eliseus hath done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">8:5</span>. And when he was telling the king how he had raised one dead to life, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying to the king for her house, and her lands.  And Giezi said:  My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Eliseus raised to life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-215">8:6</span>. And the king asked the woman:  and she told him.  And the king appointed her an eunuch, saying:  Restore her all that is hers, and all the revenues of the lands, from the day that she left the land to this present.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">8:7</span>. Eliseus also came to Damascus, and Benadad, king of Syria was sick; and they told him, saying:  The man of God is come hither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">8:8</span>. And the king said to Hazael:  Take with thee presents, and go to meet the man of God, and consult the Lord by him, saying:  Can I recover of this my illness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">8:9</span>. And Hazael went to meet him, taking with him presents, and all the good things of Damascus, the burdens of forty camels.  And when he stood before him, he said:  Thy son, Benadad, the king of Syria, hath sent me to thee, saying:  Can I recover of this my illness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">8:10</span>. And Eliseus said to him:  Go tell him:  Thou shalt recover:  but the Lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him:  thou shalt recover. . .By these words the prophet signified that the king's disease was not mortal:  and that he would recover if no violence were used.  Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover; but would be himself the instrument of his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">8:11</span>. And he stood with him, and was troubled so far as to blush:  and the man of God wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">8:12</span>. And Hazael said to him:  Why doth my lord weep?  And he said: Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel. Their strong cities thou wilt burn with fire, and their young men thou wilt kill with the sword, and thou wilt dash their children, and rip up their pregnant women.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">8:13</span>. And Hazael said:  But what am I, thy servant, a dog, that I should do this great thing?  And Eliseus said:  The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king of Syria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">8:14</span>. And when he was departed from Eliseus he came to his master, who said to him:  What said Eliseus to thee?  And he answered:  He told me: Thou shalt recover.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">8:15</span>. And on the next day, he took a blanket, and poured water on it, and spread it upon his face:  and he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">8:16</span>. In the fifth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, and of Josaphat, king of Juda, reigned Joram, son of Josaphat, king of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
And of Josaphat, etc. . .That is, Josaphat being yet alive, who sometime before his death made his son Joram king, as David had done before by his own son Solomon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">8:17</span>. He was two and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">8:18</span>. And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked:  for the daughter of Achab was his wife:  and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">8:19</span>. But the Lord would not destroy Juda, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him, to give him a light, and to his children always.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">8:20</span>. In his days Edom revolted from being under Juda, and made themselves a king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">8:21</span>. And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him:  and he arose in the night, and defeated the Edomites that had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots, but the people fled into their tents.<br/>
<br/>
8.22. So Edom revolted from being under Juda, unto this day.  Then Lobna also revolted at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">8:23</span>. But the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">8:24</span>. And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias, his son, reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">8:25</span>. In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Achab, king of Israel, reigned Ochozias, son of Joram, king of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">8:26</span>. Ochozias was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri king of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Daughter. . .That is, grand-daughter; for she was daughter of Achab son of Amri, ver. 18.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">8:27</span>. And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab:  and he did evil before the Lord, as did the house of Achab:  for he was the son in law of the house of Achab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">8:28</span>. He went also with Joram, son of Achab, to fight against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Joram:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">8:29</span>. And he went back to be healed, in Jezrahel:  because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramoth, when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria And Ochozias, the son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to visit Joram, the son of Achab, in Jezrahel, because he was sick there.<br/>

Jehu is anointed king of Israel, to destroy the house of Achab and Jezebel.  He killeth Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Juda. Jezebel is eaten by dogs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">9:1</span>. And Eliseus the prophet, called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him:  Gird up thy loins, and take this little bottle of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth Galaad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">9:2</span>. And when thou art come thither, thou shalt see Jehu the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi:  and going in, thou shalt make him rise up from amongst his brethren, and carry him into an inner chamber.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">9:6</span>. And he arose, and went into the chamber:  and he poured the oil upon his head, and said:  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  I have anointed thee king over Israel, the people of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">9:7</span>. And thou shalt cut off the house of Achab, thy master, and I will revenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">9:8</span>. And I will destroy all the house of Achab, and I will cut off from Achab, him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the meanest in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">9:9</span>. And I will make the house of Achab, like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa, the son of Ahias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">9:10</span>. And the dogs shall eat Jezabel, in the field of Jezrahel, and there shall be no one to bury her.  And he opened the door and fled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">9:11</span>. Then Jehu went forth to the servants of his Lord:  and they said to him:  Are all things well?  why came this madman to thee?  And he said to them:  You know the man, and what he said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">9:12</span>. But they answered:  It is false; but rather do thou tell us.  And he said to them:  Thus and thus did he speak to me:  and he said:  Thus saith the Lord:  I have anointed thee king over Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">9:13</span>. Then they made haste, and taking every man his garment, laid it under his feet, after the manner of a judgment seat, and they sounded the trumpet, and said:  Jehu is king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">9:14</span>. So Jehu, the son of Josaphat, the son of Namsi, conspired against Joram.  Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Galaad, he, and all Israel, fighting with Hazael, king of Syria:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">9:15</span>. And was returned to be healed in Jezrahel of his wounds; for the Syrians had wounded him, when he fought with Hazael, king of Syria.  And Jehu said:  If it please you, let no man go forth or flee out of the city, lest he go, and tell in Jezrahel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">9:16</span>. And he got up, and went into Jezrahel for Joram was sick there, and Ochozias king of Juda, was come down to visit Joram.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">9:17</span>. The watchman therefore, that stood upon the tower of Jezrahel, saw the troop of Jehu coming, and said:  I see a troop.  And Joram said: Take a chariot, and send to meet them, and let him that goeth say:  Is all well?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">9:18</span>. So there went one in a chariot to meet him, and said:  Thus saith the king:  Are all things peaceable?  And Jehu said:  What hast thou to do with peace?  go behind and follow me.  And the watchman told, saying: The messenger came to them, but he returneth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">9:19</span>. And he sent a second chariot of horses:  and he came to them, and said:  Thus saith the king:  Is there peace?  And Jehu said:  What hast thou to do with peace?  pass, and follow me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">9:20</span>. And the watchman told, saying:  He came even to them, but returneth not:  and the driving is like the driving of Jehu, the son of Namsi; for he drives furiously.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">9:21</span>. And Joram said:  Make ready the chariot.  And they made ready his chariot:  and Joram, king of Israel, and Ochozias, king of Juda, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the field of Naboth, the Jezrahelite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">9:22</span>. And when Joram saw Jehu, he said:  Is there peace, Jehu?  And he answered:  What peace?  so long as the fornications of Jezabel, thy mother, and her many sorceries, are in their vigour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">9:23</span>. And Joram turned his hand, and fleeing, said to Ochozias:  There is treachery, Ochozias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">9:24</span>. But Jehu bent his bow with his hand, and shot Joram between the shoulders:  and the arrow went out through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">9:25</span>. And Jehu said to Badacer, his captain:  Take him, and cast him into the field of Naboth, the Jezrahelite:  for I remember, when I and thou, sitting in a chariot, followed Achab, this man's father, that the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">9:26</span>. If I do not requite thee in this field, saith the Lord, for the blood of Naboth, and for the blood of his children, which I saw yesterday, saith the Lord.  So now take him, and cast him into the field, according to the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">9:27</span>. But Ochozias, king of Juda, seeing this, fled by the way of the garden house:  and Jehu pursued him, and said:  Strike him also in his chariot.  And they struck him in the going up to Gaver, which is by Jeblaam:  and he fled into Mageddo, and died there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">9:28</span>. And his servants laid him upon his chariot, and carried him to Jerusalem:  and they buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers, in the city of David.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">9:29</span>. In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Achab, Ochozias reigned over Juda;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">9:30</span>. And Jehu came into Jezrahel.  But Jezabel, hearing of his coming in, painted her face with stibic stone, and adorned her head, and looked out of a window.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">9:31</span>. At Jehu coming in at the gate, and said:  Can there be peace for Zambri, that hath killed his master?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">9:32</span>. And Jehu lifted up his face to the window, and said:  Who is this? And two or three eunuchs bowed down to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">9:33</span>. And he said to them:  Throw her down headlong; And they threw her down, and the wall was sprinkled with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trod upon her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">9:34</span>. And when he was come in to eat, and to drink, he said:  Go, and see after that cursed woman, and bury her; because she is a king's daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">9:35</span>. And when they went to bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the extremities of her hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">9:36</span>. And coming back they told him.  And Jehu said:  It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Elias, the Thesbite, saying:  In the field of Jezrahel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezabel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">9:37</span>. And the flesh of Jezabel shall be as dung upon the face of the earth in the field of Jezrahel; so that they who pass by shall say:  Is this that same Jezabel?<br/>

Therefore they that were over the king's house, and the rulers of the city, and the ancients, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying:  We are thy servants:  whatsoever thou shalt command us we will do; we will not make us any king:  do thou all that pleaseth thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">10:6</span>.

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-292">10:14</span>. And he said:  Take them alive.  And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit by the cabin, two and forty men, and he left not any of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-293">10:15</span>. And when he was departed thence, he found Jonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him, and he blessed him.  And he said to him:  Is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart?  And Jonadab said:  It is. If it be, said he, give me thy hand.  He gave him his hand.  And he lifted him up to him into the chariot,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-294">10:16</span>. And said to him:  Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.  So he made him ride in his chariot,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-295">10:17</span>. And brought him into Samaria.  And he slew all that were left of Achab, in Samaria, to a man, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-296">10:18</span>. And Jehu gathered together all the people, and said to them: Achab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him more.<br/>
<br/>
I will worship him more. . .Jehu sinned in thus pretending to worship Baal, and causing sacrifice to be offered to him:  because evil is not to be done, that good may come of it.  Rom. 3.8.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-297">10:19</span>. Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests:  let none be wanting, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal:  whosoever shall be wanting, shall not live. Now Jehu did this craftily, that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-298">10:20</span>. And he said:  Proclaim a festival for Baal.  And he called,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-299">10:21</span>. And he sent into all the borders of Israel; and all the servants of Baal came:  there was not one left that did not come.  And they went into the temple of Baal:  and the house of Baal was filled, from one end to the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-300">10:22</span>. And he said to them that were over the wardrobe:  Bring forth garments for all the servants of Baal.  And they brought them forth garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-301">10:23</span>. And Jehu, and Jonadab, the son of Rechab, went to the temple of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal:  Search, and see that there be not any with you of the servants of the Lord, but that there be the servants of Baal only.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-302">10:24</span>. And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings:  but Jehu had prepared him fourscore men without, and said to them:  If any of the men escape, whom I have brought into your hands, he that letteth him go, shall answer life for life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-303">10:25</span>. And it came to pass, when the burnt offering was ended, that Jehu commanded his soldiers and captains, saying:  Go in, and kill them: let none escape.  And the soldiers and captains slew them with the edge of the sword, and cast them out:  and they went into the city of the temple of Baal,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-304">10:26</span>. And brought the statue out of Baal's temple, and burnt it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-305">10:27</span>. And broke it in pieces.  They destroyed also the temple of Baal, and made a jakes in its place unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-306">10:28</span>. So Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-307">10:29</span>. But yet he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he forsake the golden calves that were in Bethel, and Dan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-308">10:30</span>. And the Lord said to Jehu:  because thou hast diligently executed that which was right and pleasing in my eyes, and hast done to the house of Achab according to all that was in my heart:  thy children shall sit upon the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-309">10:31</span>. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart:  for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel to sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-310">10:32</span>. In those days the Lord began to be weary of Israel:  and Hazael ravaged them in all the coasts of Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-311">10:33</span>. From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Galaad, and Gad, and Ruben, and Manasses, from Aroer, which is upon the torrent Arnon, and Galaad, and Basan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-312">10:34</span>. But the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and his strength, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-313">10:35</span>. And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz, his son, reigned in his stead.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-318">11:2</span>. But Josaba the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas, the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, out of the bedchamber with his nurse:  and hid him from the face of Athalia; so that he was not slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-319">11:3</span>. And he was with her six years, hid in the house of the Lord.  And Athalia reigned over the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-320">11:4</span>. And in the seventh year Joiada sent, and taking the centurions and soldiers, brought them in to him into the temple of the Lord, and made a covenant with them:  and taking an oath of them in the house of the Lord, shewed them the king's son:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-321">11:5</span>. And he commanded them, saying:  This is the thing that you must do.<br/>

The testimony. . .The book of the law.<br/>

She saw the king standing upon a tribunal, as the manner was, and the singers, and the trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets:  and she rent her garments, and cried:  A conspiracy, a conspiracy.<br/>
<br/>
A tribunal. . .A tribune, or a place elevated above the rest.<br/>

But Joiada commanded the centurions that were over the army, and said to them:  Have her forth without the precinct of the temple, and whosoever shall follow her, let him be slain with the sword.  For the priest had said:  Let her not be slain in the temple of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-341">12:2</span>. And Joas did that which was right before the Lord all the days that Joiada, the priest, taught him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-342">12:3</span>. But yet he took not away the high places:  for the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-343">12:4</span>. And Joas said to the priests:  all the money of the sanctified things, which is brought into the temple of the Lord by those that pass, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart, they bring into the temple of the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
Sanctified. . .That is, dedicated to God's service.--Ibid.  The price of a soul. . .That is, the ordinary oblation, which every soul was to offer by the law.  Ex. 30.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">12:5</span>. Let the priests take it according to their order and repair the house, wheresoever they shall see any thing that wanteth repairing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">12:6</span>. Now till the three and twentieth year of king Joas the priests did not make the repairs of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-346">12:7</span>. And king Joas called Joiada, the high priest, and the priests, saying to them:  Why do you not repair the temple?  Take you, therefore, money no more according to your order, but restore it for the repairing of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-347">12:8</span>. And the priests were forbidden to take any more money of the people, and to make the repairs of the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-348">12:9</span>. And Joiada, the high priest, took a chest, and bored a hole in the top, and set it by the altar at the right hand of them that came into the house of the Lord; and the priests that kept the doors, put therein all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">12:10</span>. And when they saw that there was very much money in the chest, the king's scribe, and the high priest, came up, and poured it out, and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">12:11</span>. And they gave it out by number and measure into the hands of them that were over the builders of the house of the Lord:  and they laid it out to the carpenters, and the masons, that wrought in the house of the Lord,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">12:13</span>. But there were not made of the same money for the temple of the Lord, bowls, or fleshhooks, or censers, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold and silver, of the money that was brought into the temple of the Lord:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">13:3</span>. And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the hand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, all days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">13:4</span>. But Joachaz besought the face of the Lord, and the Lord heard him:  for he saw the distress of Israel, because the king of Syria had oppressed them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">13:5</span>. And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, and they were delivered out of the hand of the king of Syria:  and the children of Israel dwelt in their pavilions as yesterday and the day before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">13:6</span>. But yet they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin, but walked in them:  and there still remained a grove also in Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
A grove. . .Dedicated to the worship of idols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">13:7</span>. And Joachaz had no more left of the people than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen:  for the king of Syria had slain them, and had brought them low as dust by threshing in the barnfloor.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">13:15</span>. And Eliseus said to him:  Bring a bow and arrows.  And when he had brought him a bow and arrows,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">13:16</span>. He said to the king of Israel:  Put thy hand upon the bow.  And when he had put his hand, Eliseus put his hands over the king's hands,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">13:17</span>. And said:  Open the window to the east.  And when he had opened it, Eliseus said:  Shoot an arrow.  And he shot.  And Eliseus said:  The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria:  and thou shalt strike the Syrians in Aphec, till thou consume them.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">13:19</span>. And the man of God was angry with him, and said:  If thou hadst smitten five or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten Syria even to utter destruction:  but now three times shalt thou smite it.<br/>
<br/>
If thou hadst smitten, etc. . .By this it appears that God had revealed to the prophet that the king should overcome the Syrians as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but as he had not at the same time revealed to him how often the king would strike, the prophet was concerned to see that he struck but thrice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">13:20</span>. And Eliseus died, and they buried him.  And the rovers from Moab came into the land the same year.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">13:21</span>. And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the sepulchre of Eliseus.  And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came to life and stood upon his feet.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">14:3</span>. And he did that which was right before the Lord, but yet not like David his father.  He did according to all things that Joas his father, did:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">14:4</span>. But this only, that he took not away the high places; for yet the people sacrificed, and burnt incense in the high places:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">14:5</span>. And when he had possession of the kingdom, he put his servants to death that had slain the king, his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">14:6</span>. But the children of the murderers he did not put to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the Lord commanded, saying:  The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:  but every man shall die for his own sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">14:7</span>. He slew of Edom in the valley of the Saltpits, ten thousand men, and took the rock by war, and called the name thereof Jectehel, unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">14:8</span>. Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying:  Come, let us see one another.<br/>
<br/>
Let us see one another. . .This was a challenge to fight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">14:9</span>. And Joas, king of Israel, sent again to Amasias, king of Juda, saying:  A thistle of Libanus sent to a cedar tree, which is in Libanus, saying:  Give thy daughter to my son to wife.  And the beasts of the forest, that are in Libanus, passed, and trod down the thistle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">14:10</span>. Thou hast beaten and prevailed over Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up; be content with this glory, and sit at home; why provokest thou evil, that thou shouldst fall, and Juda with thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">14:11</span>. But Amasias did not rest satisfied.  So Joas, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amasias, king of Juda, saw one another in Bethsames, a town in Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">14:12</span>. And Juda was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to their dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">14:13</span>. But Joas, king of Israel, took Amasias, king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son of Ochozias, in Bethsames, and brought him into Jerusalem; and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">14:14</span>. And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">14:15</span>. But the rest of the acts of Joas, which he did, and his valour, wherewith he fought against Amasias, king of Juda, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">14:16</span>. And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel:  and Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">14:17</span>. And Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Juda, lived after the death of Joas, son of Joachaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">14:19</span>. Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem:  and he fled to Lachis.  And they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">14:20</span>. And they brought him away upon horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the city of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">14:21</span>. And all the people of Juda took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father, Amasias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">14:22</span>. He built Elath, and restored it to Juda, after that the king slept with his fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">14:23</span>. In the fifteenth year of Amasias, son of Joas, king of Juda, reigned Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel, in Samaria, one and forty years:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">14:24</span>. And he did that which is evil before the Lord.  He departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">14:25</span>. He restored the borders of Israel from the entrance of Emath, unto the sea of the wilderness, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant, Jonas, the son of Amathi, the prophet, who was of Geth, which is in Opher.<br/>
<br/>
Opher. . .The tribe of Zabulon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">14:26</span>. For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was exceedingly bitter, and that they were consumed even to them that were shut up in prison, and the lowest persons, and that there was no one to help Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">14:27</span>. And the Lord did not say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">14:28</span>. But the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his valour, wherewith he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Emath to Juda, in Israel, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">17:13</span>. And the Lord testified to them in Israel, and in Juda, by the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying:  Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts, and ceremonies, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers:  and as I have sent to you in the hand of my servants the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">17:14</span>. And they hearkened not, but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers, who would not obey the Lord, their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">17:15</span>. And they rejected his ordinances, and the covenant that he made with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified against them:  and they followed vanities, and acted vainly:  and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning which the Lord had commanded them that they should not do as they did.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">17:16</span>. And they forsook all the precepts of the Lord, their God:  and made to themselves two molten calves, and groves, and adored all the host of heaven:  and they served Baal,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">17:17</span>. And consecrated their sons, and their daughters, through fire: and they gave themselves to divinations, and soothsayings:  and they delivered themselves up to do evil before the Lord, to provoke him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">17:18</span>. And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them from his sight, and there remained only the tribe of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">17:19</span>. But neither did Juda itself keep the commandments of the Lord, their God:  but they walked in the errors of Israel, which they had wrought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">17:20</span>. And the Lord cast off all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, till he cast them away from his face:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">17:21</span>. Even from that time, when Israel was rent from the house of David, and made Jeroboam, son of Nabat, their king:  for Jeroboam separated Israel from the Lord, and made them commit a great sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">17:22</span>. And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, which he had done:  and they departed not from them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">17:23</span>. Till the Lord removed Israel from his face, as he had spoken in the hand of all his servants, the prophets:  and Israel was carried away out of their land to Assyria, unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">17:24</span>. And the king of the Assyrians brought people from Babylon, and from Cutha, and from Avah, and from Emath, and from Sepharvaim:  and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">17:25</span>. And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">17:26</span>. And it was told the king of the Assyrians, and it was said:  The nations which thou hast removed, and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria, know not the ordinances of the God of the land:  and the Lord hath sent lions among them:  and behold they kill them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">17:27</span>. And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying:  Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them:  and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">17:28</span>. So one of the priests, who had been carried away captive from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should worship the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">17:29</span>. And every nation made gods of their own and put them in the temples of the high places, which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities where they dwelt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">17:30</span>. For the men of Babylon made Sochothbenoth:  and the Cuthites made Nergel:  and the men of Emath made Asima.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">17:31</span>. And the Hevites made Nebahaz, and Tharthac.  And they that were of Sepharvaim burnt their children in fire, to Adramelech and Anamelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">17:32</span>. And nevertheless they worshipped the Lord.  And they made to themselves, of the lowest of the people, priests of the high places, and they placed them in the temples of the high places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">17:33</span>. And when they worshipped the Lord, they served also their own gods, according to the custom of the nations out of which they were brought to Samaria:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">17:34</span>. Unto this day they follow the old manner:  they fear not the Lord, neither do they keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he surnamed Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">17:35</span>. With whom he made a covenant, and charged them, saying:  You shall not fear strange gods, nor shall you adore them, nor worship them, nor sacrifice to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">17:36</span>. But the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you adore, and to him shall you sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">17:37</span>. And the ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do them always:  and you shall not fear strange gods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">17:38</span>. And the covenant that he made with you, you shall not forget: neither shall ye worship strange Gods,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-521">17:39</span>. But fear the Lord, your God, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-522">17:40</span>. But they did not hearken to them, but did according to their old custom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">17:41</span>. So these nations feared the Lord, but nevertheless served also their idols:  their children also, and grandchildren, as their fathers did, so do they unto this day.<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 18<br id="bookmark-drb1752-525"/>
</b><br/>
The reign of Ezechias:  he abolisheth idolatry and prospereth. Sennacherib cometh up against him:  Rabsaces soliciteth the people to revolt; and blasphemeth the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">18:1</span>. In the third year of Osee, the son of Ela, king of Israel, reigned Ezechias, the son of Achaz, king of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">18:2</span>. He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign:  and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zacharias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">18:3</span>. And he did that which was good before the Lord, according to all that David, his father, had done<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">18:4</span>. He destroyed the high places, and broke the statues in pieces, and cut down the groves, and broke the brazen serpent, which Moses had made:  for till that time the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called its name Nohestan.<br/>
<br/>
And he called its name Noheston. . .That is, their brass; or a little brass.  So he called it in contempt, because they had made an idol of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">18:5</span>. He trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel:  so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Juda, nor any of them that were before him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">18:6</span>. And he stuck to the Lord, and departed not from his steps, but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-532">18:7</span>. Wherefore the Lord also was with him, and in all things, to which he went forth, he behaved himself wisely.  And he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and served him not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-533">18:8</span>. He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza, and all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">18:9</span>. In the fourth year of king Ezechias, which was the seventh year of Osee, the son of Ela, king of Israel, Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, came up to Samaria, and besieged it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-535">18:10</span>. And took it.  For after three years, in the sixth year of Ezechias, that is, in the ninth year of Osee, king of Israel, Samaria was taken:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-536">18:11</span>. And the king of the Assyrians carried away Israel into Assyria, and placed them in Hala, and in Habor, by the rivers of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">18:12</span>. Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, their God, but transgressed his covenant:  all that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded, they would not hear, nor do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">18:13</span>. In the fourteenth year of king Ezechias, Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, came up against the fenced cities of Juda, and took them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-539">18:14</span>. Then Ezechias, king of Juda, sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians, to Lachis, saying:  I have offended, depart from me:  and all that thou shalt put upon me, I will bear.  And the king of the Assyrians put a tax upon Ezechias, king of Juda, of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">18:15</span>. And Ezechias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">18:16</span>. At that time Ezechias broke the doors of the temple of the Lord, and the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to the king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">18:17</span>. And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan, and Rabsaris, and Rabsaces, from Lachis, to king Ezechias, with a strong army, to Jerusalem:  and they went up and came to Jerusalem, and they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the way of the fuller's field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">18:18</span>. And they called for the king:  and there went out to them Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-544">18:19</span>. And Rabsaces said to them:  Speak to Ezechias:  Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians:  What is this confidence, wherein thou trustest?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-545">18:20</span>. Perhaps thou hast taken counsel, to prepare thyself for battle. On whom dost thou trust, that thou darest to rebel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">18:21</span>. Dost thou trust in Egypt a staff of a broken reed, upon which if a man lean, it will break and go into his hand, and pierce it?  so is Pharao, king of Egypt, to all that trust in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-547">18:22</span>. But if you say to me:  We trust in the Lord, our God:  is it not he, whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away:  and hath commanded Juda and Jerusalem:  You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-548">18:23</span>. Now therefore come over to my master, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, and see whether you be able to have riders for them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-549">18:24</span>. And how can you stand against one lord of the least of my master's servants?  Dost thou trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-550">18:25</span>. Is it without the will of the Lord that I am come up to this place to destroy it?  The Lord said to me:  Go up to this land, and destroy it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-551">18:26</span>. Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe, said to Rabsaces:  We pray thee, speak to us, thy servants, in Syriac:  for we understand that tongue:  and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-552">18:27</span>. And Rabsaces answered them, saying:  Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-553">18:28</span>. Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said:  Hear the word of the great king, the king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-554">18:29</span>. Thus saith the king:  Let not Ezechias deceive you:  for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-555">18:30</span>. Neither let him make you trust in the Lord, saying:  The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-556">18:31</span>. Do not hearken to Ezechias.  For thus saith the king of the Assyrians:  Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me:  and every man of you shall eat of his own vineyard, and of his own fig tree:  and you shall drink water of your own cisterns,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-557">18:32</span>. Till I come, and take you away, to a land, like to your own land, a fruitful land, and plentiful in wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, and oil, and honey, and you shall live, and not die.  Hearken not to Ezechias, who deceiveth you, saying:  The Lord will deliver us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-558">18:33</span>. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-559">18:34</span>. Where is the god of Emath, and of Arphad?  where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava?  have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">18:35</span>. Who are they among all the gods of the nations that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-561">18:36</span>. But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for they had received commandment from the king that they should not answer him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-562">18:37</span>. And Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias, with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.<br/>
</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-563-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 19<br id="bookmark-drb1752-564"/>
</b><br/>
Ezechias is assured of God's help by Isaias the prophet.  The king of the Assyrians still threateneth and blasphemeth.  Ezechias prayeth, and God promiseth to protect Jerusalem.  An angel destroyeth the army of the Assyrians, their king returneth to Nineve, and is slain by his two sons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-565">19:1</span>. And when king Ezechias heard these words, he rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-566">19:2</span>. And he sent Eliacim, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and the ancients of the priests, covered with sackcloths, to Isaias, the prophet, the son of Amos.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">19:3</span>. And they said to him:  Thus saith Ezechias:  This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy:  the children are come to the birth, and the woman in travail hath not strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-568">19:4</span>. It may be the Lord, thy God, will hear all the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians, his master, hath sent to reproach the living God, and to reprove with words, which the Lord, thy God, hath heard:  and do thou offer prayer for the remnants that are found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-569">19:5</span>. So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-570">19:6</span>. And Isaias said to them:  Thus shall you say to your master:  Thus saith the Lord:  Be not afraid for the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-571">19:7</span>. Behold I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return into his own country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">19:8</span>. And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna:  for he had heard that he was departed from Lachis.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-573">19:9</span>. And when he heard of Tharaca, king of Ethiopia:  Behold, he is come out to fight with thee:  and was going against him, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-574">19:10</span>. Thus shall you say to Ezechias, king of Juda:  Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest:  and do not say:  Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-575">19:11</span>. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, how they have laid them waste:  and canst thou alone be delivered?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-576">19:12</span>. Have the gods of the nations delivered any of them, whom my fathers have destroyed, to wit, Gozan, and Haran, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thelassar?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-577">19:13</span>. Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Ana, and of Ava?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">19:14</span>. And when Ezechias had received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">19:15</span>. And he prayed in his sight, saying:  O Lord God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kings of the earth:  thou madest heaven and earth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">19:16</span>. Incline thy ear, and hear:  open, O Lord, thy eyes and see:  and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to upbraid unto us the living God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">19:17</span>. Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have destroyed nations, and the lands of them all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">19:18</span>. And they have cast their gods into the fire:  for they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, of wood and stone, and they destroyed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">19:19</span>. Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, the only God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">19:20</span>. And Isaias, the son of Amos, sent to Ezechias, saying:  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:  I have heard the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">19:21</span>. This is the word that the Lord hath spoken of him:  The virgin, the daughter of Sion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged her head behind thy back.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">19:22</span>. Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed? against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high?  against the holy one of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">19:23</span>. By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said:  With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus, and have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees.  And I have entered into the furthest parts thereof, and the forest of its Carmel.<br/>
<br/>
Carmel. . .A pleasant fruitful hill in the forest.  These expressions are figurative, signifying under the names of mountains and forests, the kings and provinces whom the Assyrians had triumphed over.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-588">19:24</span>. I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-589">19:25</span>. Hast thou not heard what I have done from the beginning?  from the days of old I have formed it, and now I have brought it to effect: that fenced cities of fighting men should be turned to heaps of ruins:<br/>
<br/>
I have formed it, etc. . .All thy exploits, in which thou takest pride, are no more than what I have decreed; and are not to be ascribed to thy wisdom or strength, but to my will and ordinance:  who have given to thee to take and destroy so many fenced cities, and to carry terror wherever thou comest.--Ibid.  Heaps of ruin. . .Literally ruin of the hills.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-590">19:26</span>. And the inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled and were confounded, they became like the grass of the field, and the green herb on the tops of houses, which withered before it came to maturity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-591">19:27</span>. Thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy way I knew before, and thy rage against me.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-594">19:30</span>. And whatsoever shall be left of the house of Juda, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.<br/>

Ezechias being sick, is told by Isaias that he shall die; but praying to God, he obtaineth longer life, and in confirmation thereof receiveth a sign by the sun's returning back.  He sheweth all his treasures to the ambassadors of the king of Babylon:  Isaias reproving him for it, foretelleth the Babylonish captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-604">20:1</span>. In those days Ezechias was sick unto death:  and Isaias, the son of Amos, the prophet, came and said to him:  Thus saith the Lord God: Give charge concerning thy house, for thou shalt die, and not llve.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-605">20:2</span>. And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-606">20:3</span>. I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is pleasing before thee.  And Ezechias wept with much weeping.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-607">20:4</span>. And before Isaias was gone out of the middle of the court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-608">20:5</span>. Go back, and tell Ezechias, the captain of my people:  Thus saith the Lord, the God of David, thy father:  I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears:  and behold I have healed thee:  on the third day thou shalt go up to the temple of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-609">20:6</span>. And I will add to thy days fifteen years:  and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city for my own sake, and for David, my servant's sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-610">20:7</span>. And Isaias said:  Bring me a lump of figs.  And when they had brought it, and laid it upon his boil, he was healed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-611">20:8</span>. And Ezechias had said to Isaias:  What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord the third day?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-612">20:9</span>. And Isaias said to him:  This shall be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word which he hath spoken:  Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten lines, or that it go back so many degrees?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-613">20:10</span>. And Ezechias said:  It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten lines:  and I do not desire that this be done, but let it return back ten degrees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-614">20:11</span>. And Isaias, the prophet, called upon the Lord, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwards by the lines, by which it had already gone down on the dial of Achaz.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-615">20:12</span>. At that time Berodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of the Babylonians, sent letters and presents to Ezechias:  for he had heard that Ezechias had been sick.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-616">20:13</span>. And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he shewed them the house of his aromatical spices, and the gold, and the silver, and divers precious odours, and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his treasures.  There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions, that Ezechias shewed them not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-617">20:14</span>. And Isaias, the prophet, came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men?  or from whence came they to thee?  And Ezechias said to him:  From a far country, they came to me out of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">20:15</span>. And he said:  What did they see in thy house?  Ezechias said: They saw all the things that are in my house:  There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">20:16</span>. And Isaias said to Ezechias:  Hear the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-620">20:17</span>. Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon:  nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">20:18</span>. And of thy sons also that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-622">20:19</span>. Ezechias said to Isaias:  The word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken, is good:  let peace and truth be in my days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">20:20</span>. And the rest of the acts of Ezechias, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought waters into the city, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">21:1</span>. Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Haphsiba.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-628">21:2</span>. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the idols of the nations, which the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">21:3</span>. And he turned, and built up the high places, which Ezechias, his father, had destroyed:  and he set up altars to Baal, and made groves, as Achab, the king of Israel, had done:  and he adored all the host of heaven, and served them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">21:4</span>. And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said:  In Jerusalem I will put my name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">21:5</span>. And he built altars for all the host of heaven, in the two courts of the temple of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">21:6</span>. And he made his son pass through fire:  and he used divinations, and observed omens, and appointed pythons, and multiplied soothsayers, to do evil before the Lord, and to provoke him.<br/>
<br/>
Pythons. . .That is, diviners by spirits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">21:7</span>. He set also an idol of the grove, which he had made, in the temple of the Lord:  concerning which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son:  In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-634">21:8</span>. And I will no more make the feet of Israel to be moved out of the land, which I gave to their fathers:  only if they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, according to the law which my servant Moses commanded them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-635">21:9</span>. But they hearkened not:  but were seduced by Manasses, to do evil more than the nations which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-636">21:10</span>. And the Lord spoke in the hand of his servants, the prophets, saying:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-638">21:12</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:  Behold, I will bring on evils upon Jerusalem and Juda:  that whosoever shall hear of them, both his ears shall tingle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-639">21:13</span>. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the weight of the house of Achab:  and I will efface Jerusalem, as writings tables are wont to be effaced, and I will erase and turn it, and draw the pencil often over the face thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">21:14</span>. And I will leave the remnants of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies:  and they shall become a prey, and a spoil to all their enemies.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">21:16</span>. Moreover, Manasses shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth:  besides his sins, wherewith he made Juda to sin, to do evil before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">21:17</span>. Now the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin, which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">22:3</span>. And in the eighteenth year of king Josias, the king sent Saphan, the son of Assia, the son of Messulam, the scribe of the temple of the Lord, saying to him:<br/>

<br/>
The book of the law. . .That is, Deuteronomy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">22:9</span>. And Saphan, the scribe, came to the king, and brought him word again concerning that which he had commanded, and said:  Thy servants have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord:  and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen, by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">22:10</span>. And Saphan, the scribe, told the king, saying:  Helcias, the priest, hath delivered to me a book.  And when Saphan had read it before the king,<br/>

Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Juda, concerning the words of this book which is found:  for the great wrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">23:17</span>. And he said:  What is that monument which I see?  And the men of that city answered:  It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Juda, and foretold these things which thou hast done upon the altar of Bethel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">23:18</span>. And he said:  Let him alone, let no man move his bones.  So his bones were left untouched with the bones of the prophet, that came out of Samaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">23:19</span>. Moreover all the temples of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josias took away:  and he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">23:20</span>. And he slew all the priests of the high places, that were there, upon the altars; and he burnt men's bones upon them:  and returned to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">23:21</span>. And he commanded all the people, saying:  Keep the Phase to the Lord your God, according as it is written in the book of this covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">23:22</span>. Now there was no such a Phase kept from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">23:23</span>. As was this Phase, that was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">23:24</span>. Moreover the diviners by spirits, and soothsayers, and the figures of idols, and the uncleannesses, and the abominations, that had been in the land of Juda and Jerusalem, Josias took away:  that he might perform the words of the law, that were written in the book, which Helcias the priest had found in the temple of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">23:25</span>. There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses:  neither after him did there arise any like unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">23:26</span>. But yet the Lord turned not away from the wrath of his great indignation, wherewith his anger was kindled against Juda:  because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses had provoked him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">23:27</span>. And the Lord said:  I will remove Juda also from before my face, as I have removed Israel:  and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house, of which I said:  My name shall be there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">23:28</span>. Now the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">23:29</span>. In his days Pharao Nechao, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates:  and king Josias went to meet him:  and was slain at Mageddo, when he had seen him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">23:30</span>. And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo:  and they brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre.  And the people of the land took Joachaz, the son of Josias:  and they anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">23:31</span>. Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-708">23:32</span>. And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-709">23:33</span>. And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem:  and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-710">23:34</span>. And Pharao Nechao made Eliacim, the son of Josias, king in the room of Josias his father:  and turned his name to Joakim.  And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-711">23:35</span>. And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao, after he had taxed the land for every man, to contribute according to the commandment of Pharao:  and he exacted both the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every man according to his ability:  to give to Pharao Nechao.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-712">23:36</span>. Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign:  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Zebida, the daughter of Phadaia, of Ruma.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">23:37</span>. And he did evil before the Lord according to all that his fathers had done.<br/>

</b><br/>
The reign of Joakim, Joachin, and Sedecias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-716">24:1</span>. In his days Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon came up, and Joakim became his servant three years:  then again he rebelled against him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">24:2</span>. And the Lord sent against him the rovers of the Chaldees, and the rovers of Syria, and the rovers of Moab, and the rovers of the children of Ammon:  and he sent them against Juda, to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by his servants, the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord sent against him the rovers. . .Latrunculos.  Bands or parties of men, who pillaged and plundered wherever they came.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">24:3</span>. And this came by the word of the Lord against Juda, to remove them from before him for all the sins of Manasses which he did;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">24:4</span>. And for the innocent blood that he shed, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood:  and therefore the Lord would not be appeased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-720">24:5</span>. But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-721">24:6</span>. And Joachin, his son, reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-722">24:7</span>. And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country:  for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">24:8</span>. Joachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Nohesta, the daughter of Elnathan, of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">24:9</span>. And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his father had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">24:10</span>. At that time the servants of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem, and the city was surrounded with their forts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">24:11</span>. And Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came to the city, with his servants, to assault it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">24:12</span>. And Joachin, king of Juda, went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his nobles, and his eunuchs:  and the king of Babylon received him in the eighth year of his reign.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-728">24:13</span>. And he brought out from thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house:  and he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">24:14</span>. And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the valiant men of the army, to the number of ten thousand, into captivity:  and every artificer and smith:  and none were left, but the poor sort of the people of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">24:15</span>. And he carried away Joachin into Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs:  and the judges of the land he carried into captivity, from Jerusalem, into Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-731">24:16</span>. And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers, and the smiths, a thousand, all that were valiant men, and fit for war:  and the king of Babylon led them captives into Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">24:17</span>. And he appointed Matthanias, his uncle, in his stead:  and called his name Sedecias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">24:18</span>. Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">24:19</span>. And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">24:20</span>. For the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and against Juda, till he cast them out from his face:  and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.<br/>

<p><b>4 Kings Chapter 25<br id="bookmark-drb1752-737"/>
</b><br/>
Jerusalem is besieged and taken by Nabuchodonosor:  Sedecias is taken: the city and temple are destroyed.  Godolias, who is left governor, is slain.  Joachin is exalted by Evilmerodach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">25:1</span>. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem:  and they surrounded it:  and raised works round about it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">25:2</span>. And the city was shut up and besieged till the eleventh year of king Sedecias,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">25:3</span>. The ninth day of the month:  and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">25:4</span>. And a breach was made into the city:  and all the men of war fled in the night between the two walls by the king's garden (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about), and Sedecias fled by the way that leadeth to the plains of the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">25:5</span>. And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho:  and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">25:6</span>. So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">25:7</span>. And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">25:8</span>. In the fifth month, the seventh day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan, commander of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">25:9</span>. And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">25:10</span>. And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the commander of the troops, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">25:11</span>. And Nabuzardan, the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people, that remained in the city, and the fugitives, that had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">25:12</span>. But of the poor of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">25:13</span>. And the pillars of brass that were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass, which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">25:14</span>. They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-752">25:15</span>. Moreover also the censers, and the bowls, such as were of gold in gold:  and such as were of silver in silver, the general of the army took away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-753">25:16</span>. That is, two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made in the temple of the Lord:  the brass of all these vessels was without weight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">25:17</span>. One pillar was eighteen cubits high:  and the chapiter of brass, which was upon it, was three cubits high:  and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass:  and the second pillar had the like adorning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">25:18</span>. And the general of the army took Seraias, the chief priest, and Sophonias, the second priest, and three doorkeepers:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">25:19</span>. And out of the city one eunuch, who was captain over the men of war:  and five men of them who had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher, the captain of the army, who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land:  and threescore men of the common people, who were found in the city:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">25:20</span>. These Nabuzardan, the general of the army, took away, and carried them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">25:21</span>. And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Reblatha, in the land of Emath:  so Juda was carried away out of their land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">25:22</span>. But over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, had left, he gave the government to Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">25:23</span>. And when all the captains of the soldiers had heard this, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias governor they came to Godolias to Maspha, Ismael, the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, the son of Caree, and Saraia, the son of Thanehumeth, the Netophathite, and Jezonias, the son of Maachathi, they and their men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">25:24</span>. And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying:  Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees:  stay in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">25:25</span>. But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, of the seed royal came, and ten men with him, and smote Godolias; so that he died:  and also the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him in Maspha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-763">25:26</span>. And all the people, both little and great, and the captains of the soldiers, rising up, went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-764">25:27</span>. And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin, king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the seven and twentieth day of the month:  Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin, king of Juda, out of prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-765">25:28</span>. And he spoke kindly to him:  and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-766">25:29</span>. And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-767">25:30</span>. And he appointed him a continual allowance, which was also given him by the king, day by day, all the days of his life.<br/>
