<p>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
In this Epistle St. Peter says (chap. 3.), Behold this second Epistle I write to you:  and before (chap. 1. 14,) Being assured that the laying
away of this my tabernacle is at hand.  This shews, that it was written a very short time before his martyrdom, which was about thirty-five years
after our Lord's Ascension.  In this Epistle he admonishes the faithful to be mindful of the great gifts they received from God and to join all
other virtues with their faith.  He warns them against false teachers, by describing their practices and foretelling their punishments.  He
describes the dissolution of this world by fire and the day of judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2 Peter Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
He exhorts them to join all other virtues with their faith, in order to secure their salvation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ:  to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour
Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us
by his own proper glory and virtue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises:  that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature:  flying the
corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And you, employing all care, minister in your faith, virtue:  And in virtue, knowledge:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And in knowledge, abstinence:  and in abstinence, patience:  and in patience, godliness:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And in godliness, love of brotherhood:  and in love of brotherhood, charity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. For if these things be with you and abound, they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election.  For doing these things, you shall
not sin at any time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the ever-lasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things:  though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the
present truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease whereby you may keep a memory of these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ:  but we were
eyewitnesses of his greatness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory:  This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased.  Hear ye him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And this voice, we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And we have the more firm prophetical word:  whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Understanding this first:  That no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. . .This shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one's
private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared
as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his
Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world.  Some may tell us, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures:  they may do so,
but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time:  but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-23-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>2 Peter Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-24"/>
</b><br/>
He warns them against false teachers and foretells their punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:1</span>. But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition
and deny the Lord who bought them:  bringing upon themselves swift destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Seeds of perdition. . .That is, heresies destructive of salvation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:2</span>. And many shall follow their riotousness, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:3</span>. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you.  Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not:
and their perdition slumbereth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:4</span>. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be
reserved unto judgment:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:5</span>. And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world
of the ungodly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:6</span>. And reducing the cities of the Sodomites and of the Gomorrhites into ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to
those that should after act wickedly,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:7</span>. And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:8</span>. For in sight and hearing he was just, dwelling among them who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:9</span>. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:10</span>. And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government:  audacious, self willed, they fear
not to bring in sects, blaspheming.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:11</span>. Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Bring not a railing judgment, etc. . .That is, they use no railing, nor cursing sentence; not even in their conflicts with the evil angels.  See
St. Jude, ver. 9.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:12</span>. But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not,
shall perish in their corruption:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:13</span>. Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day:  stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess,
rioting in their feasts with you:<br/>
<br/>
The delights of a day:  that is, the short delights of this world, in which they place all their happiness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:14</span>. Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not: alluring unstable souls:  having their heart exercised with
covetousness:  children of malediction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:15</span>. Leaving the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor who loved the wages of iniquity,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:16</span>. But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which, speaking with man's voice, forbade the folly of the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:17</span>. These are fountains without water and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:18</span>. For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape, such as
converse in error:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:19</span>. Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption.  For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the
slave.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:20</span>. For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled
in them and overcome:  their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:21</span>. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back from that holy
commandment which was delivered to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:22</span>. For, that of the true proverb has happened to them:  The dog is returned to his vomit; and:  The sow that was washed to her wallowing in
the mire.</p>

<p><b>2 Peter Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-48"/>
</b><br/>
Against scoffers denying the second coming of Christ.  He declares the sudden dissolution of this world and exhorts to holiness of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:1</span>. Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which, I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:2</span>. That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy prophet and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord
and Saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:3</span>. Knowing this first:  That in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:4</span>. Saying:  Where is his promise or his coming?  For since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:5</span>. For this they are wilfully ignorant of:  That the heavens were before, and the earth out of water and through water, consisting by the
word of God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:6</span>. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:7</span>. But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of the ungodly men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:8</span>. But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:9</span>. The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that
all should return to penance,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:10</span>. But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be
melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burnt up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:11</span>. Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:12</span>. Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
shall melt with the burning heat?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:13</span>. But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice dwelleth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:14</span>. Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:15</span>. And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation:  as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written
to you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:16</span>. As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and
unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:17</span>. You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own
steadfastness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:18</span>. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity,
Amen.</p>
