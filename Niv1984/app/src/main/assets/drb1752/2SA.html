<p>THE SECOND BOOK OF SAMUEL, OTHERWISE CALLED THE SECOND BOOK OF KINGS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book relates the transactions from the death of Saul until the end of David's reign, being a history for the space of about forty-six
years.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2 Kings Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
David mourneth for the death of Saul and Jonathan:  he ordereth the man to be slain who pretended he had killed Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David returned from the slaughter of the Amalecites, and abode two days in Siceleg.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul's camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head:  and when he
came to David, he fell upon his face, and adored.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And David said to him:  From whence comest thou?  And he said to him:  I am fled out of the camp of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And David said unto him:  What is the matter that is come to pass? tell me:  He said:  The people are fled from the battle, and many of the
people are fallen and dead:  moreover Saul and Jonathan his son are slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And David said to the young man that told him:  How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And the young man that told him, said:  I came by chance upon mount Gelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear:  and the chariots and horsemen
drew nigh unto him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me.  And I answered, Here am I.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And he said to me:  Who art thou?  And I said to him:  I am an Amalecite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And he said to me:  Stand over me, and kill me:  for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. So standing over him, I killed him:  for I knew that he could not live after the fall:  and I took the diadem that was on his head, and
the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to thee, my lord.<br/>
<br/>
I killed him. . .This story of the young Amalecite was not true, as may easily be proved by comparing it with the last chapter of the foregoing
book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house
of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And David said to the young man that told him:  Whence art thou? He answered:  I am the son of a stranger of Amalec.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. David said to him:  Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to kill the Lord's anointed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And David calling one of his servants, said:  Go near and fall upon him.  And he struck him so that he died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And David said to him:  Thy blood be upon thy own head:  for thy own mouth hath spoken against thee, saying:  I have slain the Lord's
anointed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. (Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.)  And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains:  how are the valiant fallen?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come upon you, neither be they fields of firstfruits:  for there was cast away the
shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not
return empty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided:  they were swifter than eagles, stronger than
lions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with scarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your attire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. How are the valiant fallen in battle?  Jonathan slain in the high places?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan:  exceeding beautiful, and amiable to me above the love of women.  As the mother loveth her only
son, so did I love thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished?</p>

<p><b>2 Kings Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-30"/>
<br/>
David is received and anointed king of Juda.  Isboseth the son of Saul reigneth over the rest of Israel.  A battle between Abner and Joab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:1</span>. And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying:  Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda?  And the Lord said to him:  Go up. And David said:  Whither shall I go up?  And he answered him:  Into Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:2</span>. So David went up, and his two wives Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:3</span>. And the men also that were with him, David brought up every man with his household:  and they abode in the towns of Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:4</span>. And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be king over the house of Juda.  And it was told David that the men of Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:5</span>. David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes Galaad, and said to them:  Blessed be you to the Lord, who have shewn this mercy to your master Saul, and have buried him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:6</span>. And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth, and I also will requite you for this good turn, because you have done this thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:7</span>. Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour:  for although your master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to be their king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:8</span>. But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul's army, took Isboseth the son of Saul, and led him about through the camp,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:9</span>. And made him king over Galaad, and over Gessuri, and over Jezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:10</span>. Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years; and only the house of Juda followed David.<br/>
<br/>
He reigned two years. . .Viz., before he began visibly to decline:  but in all he reigned seven years and six months; for so long David reigned in Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:11</span>. And the number of the days that David abode, reigning in Hebron over the house of Juda, was seven years and six months.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:12</span>. And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth the son of Saul, went out from the camp to Gabaon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:13</span>. And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David went out, and met them by the pool of Gabaon.  And when they were come together, they sat down over against one another:  the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:14</span>. And Abner said to Joab:  Let the young men rise, and play before us.  And Joab answered:  Let them rise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:15</span>. Then there arose and went over twelve in number of Benjamin, of the part of Isboseth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:16</span>. And every one catching his fellow by the head, thrust his sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell down together:  and the name of the place was called:  The field of the valiant, in Gabaon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:17</span>. And there was a very fierce battle that day:  and Abner was put to flight, with the men of Israel, by the servants of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:18</span>. And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and Abisai, and Asael:  now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of the roes that abide in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:19</span>. And Asael pursued after Abner, and turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:20</span>. And Abner looked behind him, and said:  Art thou Asael?  And he answered:  I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:21</span>. And Abner said to him:  Go to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils.  But Asael would not leave off following him close.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:22</span>. And again Abner said to Asael:  Go off, and do not follow me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:23</span>. But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside: wherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot:  and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:24</span>. Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over against the valley by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:25</span>. And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together to Abner:  and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a hill.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:26</span>. And Abner cried out to Joab, and said:  Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction?  knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive people to despair?  how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease from pursuing after their brethren?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:27</span>. And Joab said:  As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner, even in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after their brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:28</span>. Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still, and did not pursue after Israel any farther, nor fight any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">2:29</span>. And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plains: and they passed the Jordan, and having gone through all Beth-horon, came to the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">2:30</span>. And Joab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled all the people:  and there were wanting of David's servants nineteen men, beside Asael.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">2:31</span>. But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin, and of the men that were with Abner, three hundred and sixty, who all died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">2:32</span>. And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father in Bethlehem and Joab, and the men that were with him, marched all the night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.<br/>

<p><b>2 Kings Chapter 3</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-64"/>
<br/>
David groweth daily stronger.  Abner cometh over to him:  he is treacherously slain by Joab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:1</span>. Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David:  David prospering and growing always stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul decaying daily.<br/>
<br/>
There was a long war between the house of Saul, etc. . .Rather a strife or emulation than a war with arms; it lasted five years and a half.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:2</span>. And sons were born to David in Hebron:  and his firstborn was Ammon of Achinoam the Jezrahelitess:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:3</span>. And his second Cheleab of Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:  and the third Absalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmai king of Gessur:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:4</span>. And the fourth Adonias, the son of Haggith:  and the fifth Saphathia the son of Abital:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:5</span>. And the sixth Jethraam of Egla the wife of David:  these were born to David In Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:6</span>. Now while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner the son of Ner ruled the house of Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:7</span>. And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the daughter of Aia.  And Isboseth said to Abner:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:8</span>. Why didst thou go in to my father's concubine?  And he was exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth, and said:  Am I a dog's head against Juda this day, who have shewn mercy to the house of Saul thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not delivered thee into the hands of David, and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a woman?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:9</span>. So do God to Abner, and more also, unless as the Lord hath sworn to David, so I do to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:10</span>. That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul, and the throne of David be set up over Israel, and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:11</span>. And he could not answer him a word, because he feared him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:12</span>. Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself, saying: Whose is the land?  and that they should say:  Make a league with me, and my hand shall be with thee:  and I will bring all Israel to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:13</span>. And he said:  Very well:  I will make a league with thee:  but one thing I require of thee, saying:  Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul:  and so thou shalt come, and see me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:14</span>. And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul, saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:15</span>. And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband Phaltiel, the son of Lais.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">3:16</span>. And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim:  and Abner said to him:  Go and return.  And he returned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:17</span>. Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel, saying:  Both yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might reign over you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">3:18</span>. Now then do it:  because the Lord hath spoken to David, saying:  By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines, and of all their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">3:19</span>. And Abner spoke also to Benjamin.  And he went to speak to David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to all Benjamin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">3:20</span>. And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men:  and David made a feast for Abner, and his men that came with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">3:21</span>. And Abner said to David:  I will rise, that I may gather all Israel unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth.  Now when David had brought Abner on his way, and he was gone in peace,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">3:22</span>. Immediately, David's servants and Joab came, after having slain the robbers, with an exceeding great booty.  And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had now sent him away, and he was gone in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">3:23</span>. And Joab and all the army that was with him, came afterwards:  and it was told Joab, that Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">3:24</span>. And Joab went in to the king, and said:  What hast thou done? Behold Abner came to thee:  Why didst thou send him away, and he is gone and departed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">3:25</span>. Knowest thou not Abner the son of Ner, that to this end he came to thee, that he might deceive thee, and to know thy going out, and thy coming in, and to know all thou dost?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">3:26</span>. Then Joab going out from David, sent messengers after Abner, and brought him back from the cistern of Sira, David knowing nothing of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">3:27</span>. And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate, to speak to him treacherously:  and he stabbed him there in the groin, and he died, in revenge of the blood of Asael his brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">3:28</span>. And when David heard of it, after the thing was now done, he said:  I, and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">3:29</span>. And may it come upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house:  and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed, or that is a leper, or that holdeth the distaff, or that falleth by the sword, or that wanteth bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">3:30</span>. So Joab and Abisai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">3:31</span>. And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloths, and mourn before the funeral of Abner.  And king David himself followed the bier.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">3:32</span>. And when they had buried Abner in Hebron, king David lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner:  and all the people also wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">3:33</span>. And the king mourning and lamenting over Abner, said:  Not as cowards are wont to die, hath Abner died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">3:34</span>. Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet laden with fetters:  but as men fall before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.  And all the people repeating it wept over him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">3:35</span>. And when all the people came to take meat with David, while it was yet broad day, David swore, saying:  So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or any thing else before sunset.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">3:36</span>. And all the people heard, and they were pleased, and all that the king did seemed good in the sight of all the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">3:37</span>. And all the people, and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's doing, that Abner the son of Ner was slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">3:38</span>. The king also said to his servants:  Do you not know that a prince and a great man is slain this day in Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">3:39</span>. But I as yet am tender, though anointed king.  And these men the sons of Sarvia are too hard for me:  the Lord reward him that doth evil according to his wickedness.<br/>

<p><b>2 Kings Chapter 4<br id="bookmark-drb1752-105"/>
</b><br/>
Isboseth is murdered by two of his servants.  David punisheth the murderers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">4:1</span>. And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron: and his hands were weakened, and all Israel was troubled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">4:2</span>. Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands, the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Remmon a Berothite of the children of Benjamin:  for Beroth also was reckoned in Benjamin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">4:3</span>. And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there until that time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">4:4</span>. And Jonathan the son of Saul had a son that was lame of his feet: for he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Jezrahel.  And his nurse took him up and fled:  and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame:  and his name was Miphiboseth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">4:5</span>. And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day:  and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon.  And the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">4:6</span>. And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">4:7</span>. For when they came into the house, he was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him and taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">4:8</span>. And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron:  and they said to the king:  Behold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy who sought thy life:  and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">4:9</span>. But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them:  As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">4:10</span>. The man that told me, and said:  Saul is dead, who thought he brought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">4:11</span>. How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your hand, and take you away from the earth?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:12</span>. And David commanded his servants and they slew them:  and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in Hebron:  but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.<br/>

David is anointed king of all Israel.  He taketh Jerusalem, and dwelleth there.  He defeateth the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">5:1</span>. Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying: Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">5:2</span>. Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel:  and the Lord said to thee:  Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">5:3</span>. The ancients also of Israel came to the king of Hebron, and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord:  and they anointed David to be king over Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">5:4</span>. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:5</span>. In Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years and six months:  and in Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all Israel and Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:6</span>. And the king and all the men that were with him went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land:  and they said to David: Thou shalt not come in hither unless thou take away the blind and the lame that say:  David shall not come in hither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:7</span>. But David took the castle of Sion, the same is the city of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:8</span>. For David had offered that day a reward to whosoever should strike the Jebusites and get up to the gutters of the tops of the houses, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the soul of David: therefore it is said in the proverb:  The blind and the lame shall not come into the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:9</span>. And David dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:10</span>. And he went on prospering and growing up, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:11</span>. And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls:  and they built a house for David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:12</span>. And David knew that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom over his people Israel.<br/>
<br/>

David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem. . .Not harlots, but wives of an inferior condition; for such, in scripture, are styled concubines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">5:14</span>. And these are the names of them, that were born to him in Jerusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">5:17</span>. And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David to be king over Israel:  and they all came to seek David:  and when David heard of it, he went down to a strong hold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">5:18</span>. And the Philistines coming spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">5:19</span>. And David consulted the Lord, Saying:  Shall I go up to the Philistines?  and wilt thou deliver them into my hand?  And the Lord said to David:  Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:20</span>. And David came to Baal Pharisim:  and defeated them there, and he said, The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided.  Therefore the name of the place was called Baal Pharisim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">5:21</span>. And they left there their idols:  which David and his men took away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">5:22</span>. And the Philistines came up again and spread themselves into the valley of Raphaim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">5:23</span>. And David consulted the Lord:  Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands?  He answered:  Go not up against them but fetch a compass behind them, and thou shalt come upon them over against the pear trees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:24</span>. And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle:  for then will the Lord go out before thy face to strike the army of the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">5:25</span>. And David did as the Lord had commanded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gabaa until thou come to Gezer.<br/>

David fetcheth the ark from Cariathiarim.  Oza is struck dead for touching it.  It is deposited in the house of Obededom:  and from thence carried to David's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">6:1</span>. And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">6:2</span>. And David arose and went, with all the people that were with him of the men of Juda to fetch the ark of God, upon which the name of the Lord of Hosts is invoked, who sitteth over it upon the cherubims.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">6:3</span>. And they laid the ark of God upon a new cart:  and took it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, and Oza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.<br/>
<br/>
Gabaa. . .The hill of Cariathiarim, where the ark had been in the house of Abinadab, from the time of its being restored back by the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:4</span>. And when they had taken it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, Ahio having care of the ark of God went before the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">6:5</span>. But David and all Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of wood, on harps and lutes and timbrels and cornets and cymbals.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:6</span>. And when they came to the floor of Nachon, Oza put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it:  because the oxen kicked and made it lean aside.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:7</span>. And the indignation of the Lord was enkindled against Oza, and he struck him for his rashness:  and he died there before the ark of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:8</span>. And David was grieved because the Lord had struck Oza, and the name of that place was called:  The striking of Oza, to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:9</span>. And David was afraid of the Lord that day, saying:  How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:10</span>. And he would not have the ark of the Lord brought in to himself into the city of David:  but he caused it to be carried into the house of Obededom the Gethite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:11</span>. And the ark of the Lord abode in the house of Obededom the Gethite three months:  and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">6:12</span>. And it was told king David, that the Lord had blessed Obededom, and all that he had, because of the ark of God.  So David went, and brought away the ark of God out of the house of Obededom into the city of David with joy.  And there were with David seven choirs, and calves for victims.<br/>
<br/>
Choirs. . .Or companies of musicians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">6:13</span>. And when they that carried the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed and ox and a ram:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">6:14</span>. And David danced with all his might before the Lord:  and David was girded with a linen ephod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:15</span>. And David and all the louse of Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and with sound of trumpet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:16</span>. And when the ark of the Lord was come into the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul, looking out through a window, saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord:  and she despised him in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">6:17</span>. And they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it:  and David offered holocausts, and peace offerings before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">6:18</span>. And when he had made an end of offering holocausts and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">6:19</span>. And he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, both men and women, to every one, a cake of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and fine flour fried with oil:  and all the people departed every one to his own house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">6:20</span>. And David returned to bless his own house:  and Michol the daughter of Saul coming out to meet David, said:  How glorious was the king of Israel to day, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be naked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">6:21</span>. And David said to Michol:  Before the Lord, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, and commanded me to be ruler over the people of the Lord in Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">6:22</span>. I will both play and make myself meaner than I have done:  and I will be little in my own eyes:  and with the handmaids of whom thou speakest, I shall appear more glorious.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">7:2</span>. He said to Nathan the prophet:  Dost thou see that I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God is lodged within skins?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">7:7</span>. In all the places that I have gone through with all the children of Israel, did ever I speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying:  Why have you not built me a house of cedar?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">9:2</span>. Now there was of the house of Saul, a servant named Siba:  and when the king had called him to him, he said to him:  Art thou Siba?  And he answered:  I am Siba thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">9:3</span>. And the king said:  Is there any one left of the house of Saul, that I may shew the mercy of God unto Him?  And Siba said to the king: There is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">9:4</span>. Where is he?  said he.  And Siba said to the king:  Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodabar.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">9:7</span>. And David said to him:  Fear not, for I will surely shew thee mercy for Jonathan thy father's sake, and I will restore the lands of Saul the father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table always.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">9:9</span>. Then the King called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him: All that belonged to Saul, and all his house, I have given to thy master's son.<br/>

Thou therefore and the sons and thy servants shall till the land for him:  and thou shalt bring in food for thy master's son, that he may be maintained:  and Miphiboseth the son of thy master shall always eat bread at my table.  And Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.<br/>

The Ammonites shamefully abuse the ambassadors of David:  they hire the Syrians to the their assistance:  but are overthrown with their allies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">10:1</span>. And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanon his son reigned in his stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">10:2</span>. And David said:  I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Daas, as his father shewed kindness to me.  So David sent his servants to comfort him for the death of his father.  But when the servants of David were come into the land of the children of Ammon,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">10:3</span>. The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon their lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath sent comforters to thee, and hath not David rather sent his servants to thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow it?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">10:4</span>. Wherefore Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut away half of their garments even to the buttocks, and sent them away.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">10:5</span>. When this was told David, he sent to meet them:  for the men were sadly put to confusion, and David commanded them, saying:  Stay at Jericho, till your beards be grown, and then return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">10:6</span>. And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done an injury to David, sent and hired the Syrians of Rohob, and the Syrians of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha a thousand men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">10:7</span>. And when David heard this, he sent Joab and the whole army of warriors.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">10:9</span>. Then Joab seeing that the battle was prepared against him, both before and behind, chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">10:10</span>. And the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai his brother, who set them in array against the children of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">10:11</span>. And Joab said:  If the Syrians are too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the children of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will help thee.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">10:15</span>. Then the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, gathered themselves together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">10:16</span>. And Adarezer sent and fetched the Syrians, that were beyond the river, and brought over their army:  and Sobach, the captain of the host of Adarezer, was their general.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">10:17</span>. And when this was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam:  and the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought against him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">10:18</span>. And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen: and smote Sobach the captain of the army, who presently died.<br/>

And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer, seeing themselves overcome by Israel, were afraid and fled away, eight and fifty thousand men before Israel.  And they made peace with Israel:  and served them, and all the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.<br/>

David falleth into the crime of adultery with Bethsabee:  and not finding other means to conceal it, causeth her husband Urias to be slain.  Then marrieth her, who beareth him a son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">11:1</span>. And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth to war, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they spoiled the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabba:  but David remained in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">11:2</span>. In the mean time it happened that David arose from his bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house:  And he saw from the roof of his house a woman washing herself, over against him:  and the woman was very beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">11:3</span>. And the king sent, and inquired who the woman was.  And it was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urias the Hethite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">11:4</span>. And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him, and he slept with her:  and presently she was purified from her uncleanness:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">11:5</span>. And she returned to her house having conceived.  And she sent and told David, and said:  I have conceived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">11:6</span>. And David sent to Joab, saying:  Send me Urias the Hethite.  And Joab sent Urias to David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">11:7</span>. And Urias came to David.  And David asked how Joab did, and the people, and how the war was carried on.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">11:8</span>. And David said to Urias:  Go into thy house, and wash thy feet. And Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out after him a mess of meat from the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">11:9</span>. But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">11:10</span>. And it was told David by some that said:  Urias went not to his house.  And David said to Urias:  Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">11:11</span>. And Urias said to David:  The ark of God and Israel and Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth:  and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife?  By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">11:12</span>. Then David said to Urias:  Tarry here to day, and to morrow I will send thee away.  Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">11:13</span>. And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk:  and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">11:14</span>. And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab:  and sent it by the hand of Urias,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">11:15</span>. Writing in the letter:  Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest:  and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">11:16</span>. Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest men were.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">11:17</span>. And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the Hethite was killed also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">11:18</span>. Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">11:19</span>. And he charged the messenger, saying:  When thou hast told all the words of the battle to the king,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">11:20</span>. If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say:  Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight?  knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">11:21</span>. Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal?  did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall and slew him in Thebes?  Why did you go near the wall?  Thou shalt say:  Thy servant Urias the Hethite is also slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">11:22</span>. So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had commanded him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">11:23</span>. And the messenger said to David:  The men prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field:  and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">11:24</span>. And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above:  and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">11:25</span>. And David said to the messenger:  Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee:  for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against the city, and exhort them that thou mayest overthrow it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">11:26</span>. And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">11:27</span>. And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son:  and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.<br/>

Nathan's parable.  David confesseth his sin, and is forgiven:  yet so as to be sentenced to most severe temporal punishments.  The death of the child.  The birth of Solomon.  The taking of Rabbath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">12:1</span>. And the Lord sent Nathan to David:  and when he was come to him, he said to him:  There were two men in one city, the one rich, and the other poor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-289">12:2</span>. The rich man had exceeding many sheep and oxen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-290">12:3</span>. But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom:  and it was unto him as a daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-291">12:4</span>. And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger, who was come to him, but took the poor man's ewe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-292">12:5</span>. And David's anger being exceedingly kindled against that man, he said to Nathan:  As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this is a child of death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-293">12:6</span>. He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this thing, and had no pity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-294">12:7</span>. And Nathan said to David:  Thou art the man.  Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel:  I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-295">12:8</span>. And gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda:  and if these things be little, I shall add far greater things unto thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-296">12:9</span>. Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to do evil in my sight?  Thou hast killed Urias the Hethite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-297">12:10</span>. Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the Hethite to be thy wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-298">12:11</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes and give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.<br/>
<br/>
I will raise, etc. . .All these evils, inasmuch as they were punishments, came upon David by a just judgment of God, for his sin, and therefore God says, I will raise, etc.; but inasmuch as they were sins, on the part of Absalom and his associates, God was not the author of them, but only permitted them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-299">12:12</span>. For thou didst it secretly:  but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and in the sight of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-300">12:13</span>. And David said to Nathan:  I have sinned against the Lord.  And Nathan said to David:  The Lord also hath taken away thy sin:  thou shalt not die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-301">12:14</span>. Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-302">12:15</span>. And Nathan returned to his house.  The Lord also struck the child which the wife of Urias had borne to David, and his life was despaired of.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-303">12:16</span>. And David besought the Lord for the child:  and David kept a fast, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-304">12:17</span>. And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from the ground:  but he would not, neither did he eat meat with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-305">12:18</span>. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died:  and the servants of David feared to tell him, that the child was dead.  For they said:  Behold when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice:  how much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the child is dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-306">12:19</span>. But when David saw his servants whispering, he understood that the child was dead:  and he said to his servants:  Is the child dead? They answered him He is dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-307">12:20</span>. Then David arose from the ground, and washed and anointed himself:  and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the house of the Lord:  and worshipped, and then he came into his own house, and he called for bread, and ate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-308">12:21</span>. And his servants said to him:  What thing is this that thou hast done?  thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-309">12:22</span>. And he said:  While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept for him:  for I said:  Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give him to me, and the child may live?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-310">12:23</span>. But now that he is dead, why should I fast?  Shall I be able to bring him back any more?  I shall go to him rather:  but he shall not return to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-311">12:24</span>. And David comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto her, and slept with her:  and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon, and the Lord loved him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-312">12:25</span>. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name, Amiable to the Lord, because the Lord loved him.<br/>
<br/>
Amiable to the Lord. . .Or, beloved of the Lord.  In Hebrew, Jedidiah.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-313">12:26</span>. And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and laid close siege to the royal city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-314">12:27</span>. And Joab sent messengers to David, saying:  I have fought against Rabbath, and the city of waters is about to be taken.<br/>
<br/>
The city of waters. . .Rabbath the royal city of the Ammonites, was called the city of waters, from being encompassed with waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-315">12:28</span>. Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people together, and besiege the city and take it:  lest when the city shall be wasted by me, the victory be ascribed to my name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-316">12:29</span>. Then David gathered all the people together, and went out against Rabbath:  and after fighting, he took it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-317">12:30</span>. And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold, set with most precious stones, and it was put upon David's head, and the spoils of the city which were very great he carried away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-318">12:31</span>. And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and drove over them chariots armed with iron:  and divided them with knives, and made them pass through brickkilns:  so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon:  and David returned, with all the army to Jerusalem.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-324">13:4</span>. And he said to him:  Why dost thou grow so lean from day to day, O son of the king?  why dost thou not tell me the reason of it?  And Ammon said to him:  I am in love with Thamar the sister of my brother Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-325">13:5</span>. And Jonadab said to him:  Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick:  and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him:  Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-326">13:6</span>. So Ammon lay down, and made as if he were sick:  and when the king came to visit him, Ammon said to the king:  I pray thee let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that I may eat at her hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-327">13:7</span>. Then David sent home to Thamar, saying:  Come to the house of thy brother Ammon, and make him a mess.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-328">13:8</span>. And Thamar came to the house of Ammon her brother:  but he was laid down:  and she took meal and tempered it:  and dissolving it in his sight she made little messes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-329">13:9</span>. And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before him, but he would not eat:  and Ammon said:  Put out all persons from me.  And when they had put all persons out,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-330">13:10</span>. Ammon said to Thamar:  Bring the mess into the chamber, that I may eat at thy hand.  And Thamar took the little messes which she had made, and brought them in to her brother Ammon in the chamber.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-331">13:11</span>. And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of her, and said:  Come lie with me, my sister.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-332">13:12</span>. She answered him:  Do not so, my brother, do not force me:  for no such thing must be done in Israel.  Do not thou this folly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-333">13:13</span>. For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel:  but rather speak to the king, and he will not deny me to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-334">13:14</span>. But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being stronger overpowered her and lay with her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">13:15</span>. Then Ammon hated her with an exceeding great hatred:  so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her before.  And Ammon said to her:  Arise, and get thee gone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-336">13:16</span>. She answered him:  The evil which now thou dost against me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst before.  And he would not hearken to her:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-337">13:17</span>. But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said:  Thrust this woman out from me:  and shut the door after her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">13:18</span>. And she was clothed with a long robe:  for the king's daughters that were virgins, used such kind of garments.  Then his servant thrust her out:  and shut the door after her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-339">13:19</span>. And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe and laid her hands upon her head, and went on crying.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-340">13:20</span>. And Absalom her brother said to her:  Hath thy brother Ammon lain with thee?  but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy brother:  and afflict not thy heart for this thing.  So Thamar remained pining away in the house of Absalom her brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-341">13:21</span>. And when king David heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved:  and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Ammon, for he loved him, because he was his firstborn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-342">13:22</span>. But Absalom spoke not to Ammon neither good nor evil:  for Absalom hated Ammon because he had ravished his sister Thamar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-343">13:23</span>. And it came to pass after two years, that the sheep of Absalom were shorn in Baalhasor, which is near Ephraim:  and Absalom invited all the king's sons:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">13:24</span>. And he came to the king, and said to him:  Behold thy servant's sheep are shorn.  Let the king, I pray, with his servants come to his servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">13:25</span>. And the king said to Absalom:  Nay, my son, do not ask that we should all come, and be chargeable to thee.  And when he pressed him, and he would not go, he blessed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-346">13:26</span>. And Absalom said:  If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother Ammon, I beseech thee, come with us.  And the king said to him:  It is not necessary that he should go with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-347">13:27</span>. But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Ammon and all the king's sons go with him.  And Absalom made a feast as it were the feast of a king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-348">13:28</span>. And Absalom had commanded his servants, saying:  Take notice when Ammon shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to you:  Strike him, and kill him, fear not:  for it is I that command you:  take courage, and be valiant men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">13:29</span>. And the servants of Absalom did to Ammon as Absalom had commanded them.  And all the king's sons arose and got up every man upon his mule, and fled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">13:30</span>. And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to David, saying:  Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one them left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-351">13:31</span>. Then the king rose up, and rent his garments:  and fell upon the ground, and all his servants, that stood about him, rent their garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">13:32</span>. But Jonadab the son of Semmaa David's brother answering, said: Let not my lord the king think that all the king's sons are slain: Ammon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of Absalom from the day that he ravished his sister Thamar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">13:33</span>. Now therefore let not my lord the king take this thing into his heart, saying:  All the king's sons are slain:  for Ammon only is dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">13:34</span>. But Absalom fled away:  and the young man that kept the watch, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there came much people by a by-way on the side of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">13:35</span>. And Jonadab said to the king:  Behold the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">13:36</span>. And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also appeared:  and coming in they lifted up their voice, and wept:  and the king also and all his servants wept very much.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">13:37</span>. But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai the son of Ammiud the king of Gessur.  And David mourned for his son every day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">13:38</span>. And Absalom after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was there three years.  And king David ceased to pursue after Absalom, because he was comforted concerning the death of Ammon.<br/>

Joab procureth Absalom's return, and his admittance to the king's presence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">14:1</span>. And Joab the son of Sarvia, understanding that the king's heart was turned to Absalom,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">14:2</span>. Sent to Thecua, and fetched from thence a wise woman:  and said to her:  Feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, and be not anointed with oil, that thou mayest be as a woman that had a long time been mourning for one dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-363">14:3</span>. And thou shalt go in to the king, and shalt speak to him in this manner.  And Joab put the words in her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-364">14:4</span>. And when the woman of Thecua was come in to the king, she fell before him upon the ground, and worshipped, and said:  Save me, O king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">14:5</span>. And the king said to her:  What is the matter with thee?  She answered:  Alas, I am a widow woman:  for my husband is dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">14:6</span>. And thy handmaid had two sons:  and they quarrelled with each other in the field, and there was none to part them:  and the one struck the other, and slew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">14:7</span>. And behold the whole kindred rising against thy handmaid, saith: Deliver him that hath slain his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and that we may destroy the heir: and they seek to quench my spark which is left, and will leave my husband no name, nor remainder upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">14:8</span>. And the king said to the woman:  Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">14:9</span>. And the woman of Thecua said to the king:  Upon me, my lord be the iniquity, and upon the house of my father:  but may the king and his throne be guiltless.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">14:10</span>. And the king said:  If any one shall say ought against thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">14:11</span>. And she said:  Let the king remember the Lord his God, that the next of kin be not multiplied to take revenge, and that they may not kill my son.  And he said:  As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">14:12</span>. The woman said:  Let thy hand maid speak one word to my lord the king.  And he said:  Speak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">14:13</span>. And the woman said:  Why hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God, and why hath the king spoken this word, to sin, and not bring home again his own exile?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">14:14</span>. We all die, and like waters that return no more, we fall down into the earth:  neither will God have a soul to perish, but recalleth, meaning that he that is cast off should not altogether perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">14:15</span>. Now therefore I am come, to speak this word to my lord the king before the people.  And thy handmaid said:  I will speak to the king, it maybe the king will perform the request of his handmaid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">14:16</span>. And the king hath hearkened to me to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of all that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">14:17</span>. Then let thy handmaid say, that the word of the Lord the king be made as a sacrifice.  For even as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, that he is neither moved with blessing nor cursing:  wherefore the Lord thy God is also with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">14:18</span>. And the king answering, said to the woman:  Hide not from me the thing that I ask thee.  And the woman said to him:  Speak, my lord the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">14:19</span>. And the king said:  Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?  The woman answered, and said:  By the health of thy soul, my lord, O king, it is neither on the left hand, nor on the right, in all these things which my lord the king hath spoken:  for thy servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words into the mouth of thy handmaid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">14:20</span>. That I should come about with this form of speech, thy servant Joab commanded this:  but thou, my lord, O king, art wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to understand all things upon earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">14:21</span>. And the king said to Joab:  Behold I am appeased and have granted thy request:  Go therefore and fetch back the boy Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">14:22</span>. And Joab falling down to the ground upon his face, adored, and blessed the king:  and Joab said:  This day thy servant hath understood, that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king:  for thou hast fulfilled the request of thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed. . .That is, and gave thanks to the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">14:23</span>. Then Joab arose and went to Gessur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">14:24</span>. But the king said:  Let him return into his house, and let him not see my face.  So Absalom returned into his house, and saw not the king's face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">14:25</span>. But in all Israel there was not a man so comely, and so exceedingly beautiful as Absalom:  from the sole of the foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">14:26</span>. And when he polled his hair (now he was polled once a year, because his hair was burdensome to him) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred sicles, according to the common weight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">14:27</span>. And there were born to Absalom three sons:  and one daughter, whose name was Thamar, and she was very beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">14:28</span>. And Absalom dwelt two years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">14:29</span>. He sent therefore to Joab, to send him to the king:  but he would not come to him.  And when he had sent the second time, and he would not come to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">14:30</span>. He said to his servants:  You know the field of Joab near my field, that hath a crop of barley:  go now and set it on fire.  So the servants of Absalom set the corn on fire.  And Joab's servants coming with their garments rent, said:  The servants of Absalom have set part of the field on fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">14:31</span>. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said:  Why have thy servants set my corn on fire?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">14:32</span>. And Absalom answered Joab:  I sent to thee beseeching thee to come to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him: Wherefore am I come from Gessur?  it had been better for me to be there: I beseech thee therefore that I may see the face of the king:  and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">14:33</span>. So Joab going in to the king, told him all:  and Absalom was called for, and, he went in to the king:  and prostrated himself on the ground before him:  and the king kissed Absalom.<br/>

Absalom's policy and conspiracy.  David is obliged to flee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">15:1</span>. Now after these things Absalom made himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">15:2</span>. And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any man had business to come to the king's judgment, Absalom called him to him, and said:  Of what city art thou?  He answered, and said:  Thy servant is of such tribe of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">15:3</span>. And Absalom answered him:  Thy words seem to me good and just.  But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee.  And Absalom said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">15:4</span>. O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business might come to me, that I might do them justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">15:5</span>. Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">15:6</span>. And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to be heard by the king, and he enticed the hearts of the men of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">15:7</span>. And after forty years, Absalom said to king David:  Let me go, and pay my vows which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">15:8</span>. For thy servant made a vow, when he was in Gessur of Syria, saying:  If the Lord shall bring me again into Jerusalem, I will offer sacrifice to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">15:9</span>. And king David said to him:  Go in peace.  And he arose, and went to Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">15:10</span>. And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel, saying:  As soon as you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye:  Absalom reigneth in Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">15:11</span>. Now there went with Absalom two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and knowing nothing of the design.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">15:12</span>. Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city Gilo.  And while he was offering sacrifices, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running together increased with Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">15:13</span>. And there came a messenger to David, saying:  All Israel with their whole heart followeth Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">15:14</span>. And David said to his servants, that were with him in Jerusalem: Arise and let us flee:  for we shall not escape else from the face of Absalom:  make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">15:15</span>. And the king's servants said to him:  Whatsoever our lord the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">15:16</span>. And the king went forth, and all his household on foot:  and the king left ten women his concubines to keep the house:<br/>
<br/>
Concubines. . .That is, wives of an inferior degree.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">15:17</span>. And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood afar off from the house:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">15:18</span>. And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors, six hundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">15:19</span>. And the king said to Ethai the Gethite:  Why comest thou with us: return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come out of thy own place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">15:20</span>. Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go forth with us?  but I shall go whither I am going:  return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee mercy, and truth, because thou hast shewn grace and fidelity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">15:21</span>. And Ethai answered the king, saying:  As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth:  in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">15:22</span>. And David said to Ethai:  Come, and pass over.  And Ethai the Gethite passed, and all the men that were with him, and the rest of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">15:23</span>. And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over:  the king also himself went over the brook Cedron, and all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">15:24</span>. And Sadoc the priest also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God:  and Abiathar went up, till all the people that was come out of the city had done passing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">15:25</span>. And the king said to Sadoc:  Carry back the ark of God into the city:  if I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he will bring me again, and he will shew me it, and his tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">15:26</span>. But if he shall say to me:  Thou pleasest me not:  I am ready, let him do that which is good before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">15:27</span>. And the king said to Sadoc the priest:  O seer, return into the city in peace:  and let Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, be with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">15:28</span>. Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the wilderness, till there come word from you to certify me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">15:29</span>. So Sadoc and Abiathar carried back the ark of God into Jerusalem:  and they tarried there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">15:30</span>. But David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, going up and weeping, walking barefoot, and with his head covered, and all the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered weeping.<br/>
<br/>
Weeping, etc. . .David on this occasion wept for his sins, which he knew were the cause of all his sufferings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">15:31</span>. And it was told David that Achitophel also was in the conspiracy with Absalom, and David said:  Infatuate, O Lord, I beseech thee, the counsel of Achitophel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">15:32</span>. And when David was come to the top of the mountain, where he was about to adore the Lord, behold Chusai the Arachite, came to meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">15:33</span>. And David said to him:  If thou come with me, thou wilt be a burden to me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">15:34</span>. But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to Absalom:  I am thy servant, O king:  as I have been thy father's servant, so I will be thy servant:  thou shalt defeat the counsel of Achitophel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">15:35</span>. And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">15:36</span>. And there are with them their two sons Achimaas; the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar:  and you shall send by them to me every thing that you shall hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">15:37</span>. Then Chusai the friend of David went into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.<br/>

Siba bringeth provisions to David.  Semei curseth him.  Absalom defileth his father's wives.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">16:1</span>. And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">16:2</span>. And the king said to Siba:  What mean these things?  And Siba answered:  The asses are for the king's household to sit on:  and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">16:3</span>. And the king said:  Where is thy master's son?  And Siba answered the king:  He remained in Jerusalem, saying:  To day, will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">16:4</span>. And the king said to Siba:  I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth.  And Siba said:  I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">16:5</span>. And king David came as far as Bahurim:  and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">16:6</span>. And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:  and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">16:7</span>. And thus said Semei when he cursed the king:  Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">16:8</span>. The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son:  and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">16:9</span>. And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king:  Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?  I will go, and cut off his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">16:10</span>. And the king said:  What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia?  Let him alone and let him curse:  for the Lord hath bid him curse David:  and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?<br/>
<br/>
Hath bid him curse. . .Not that the Lord was the author of Semei's sin, which proceeded purely from his own malice, and the abuse of his free will.  But that knowing, and suffering his malicious disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish David for his sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">16:11</span>. And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants:  Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life:  how much more now a son of Jemini?  let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">16:12</span>. Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">16:13</span>. And David and his men with him went by the way.  And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">16:14</span>. And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">16:15</span>. But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">16:16</span>. And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him:  God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">16:17</span>. And Absalom said to him, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?  Why wentest thou not with thy friend?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">16:18</span>. And Chusai answered Absalom:  Nay:  for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">16:19</span>. Besides this, whom shall I serve?  is it not the king's son?  as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">16:20</span>. And Absalom said to Achitophel:  Consult what we are to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">16:21</span>. And Achitophel said to Absalom:  Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house:  that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.<br/>
<br/>
Their hands may be strengthened, etc. . .The people might apprehend lest Absalom should be reconciled to his father, and therefore they followed him with some fear of being left in the lurch, till they saw such a crime committed as seemed to make a reconciliation impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">16:22</span>. So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">16:23</span>. Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God:  so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.<br/>

Achitophel's counsel is defeated by Chusai:  who sendeth intelligence to David.  Achitophel hangeth himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">17:1</span>. And Achitophel said to Absalom:  I will choose me twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">17:2</span>. And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak handed) I will defeat him:  and when all the people is put to flight that is with him, I will kill the king who will be left alone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">17:3</span>. And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but one man:  for thou seekest but one man:  and all the people shall be in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">17:4</span>. And his saying pleased Absalom, and all the ancients of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">17:5</span>. But Absalom said:  Call Chusai the Arachite, and let us hear what he also saith.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">17:6</span>. And when Chusai was come to Absalom, Absalom said to him: Achitophel hath spoken after this manner:  shall we do it or not?  what counsel dost thou give?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">17:7</span>. And Chusai said to Absalom:  The counsel that Achitophel hath given this time is not good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">17:8</span>. And again Chusai said:  Thou knowest thy father, and the men that are with him, that they are very valiant, and bitter in their mind, as a bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken away:  and thy father is a warrior, and will not lodge with the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">17:9</span>. Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he liest:  and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth it shall say:  There is a slaughter among the people that followed Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">17:10</span>. And the most valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall melt for fear:  for all the people of Israel know thy father to be a valiant man, and that all who are with him are valiant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">17:11</span>. But this seemeth to me to be good counsel:  Let all Israel be gathered to thee, from Dan to Bersabee, as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered:  and thou shalt be in the midst of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">17:12</span>. And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be found:  and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the ground, and we shall not leave of the men that are with him, not so much as one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">17:13</span>. And if he shall enter into any city, all Israel shall cast ropes round about that city, and we will draw it into the river, so that there shall not be found so much as one small stone thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">17:14</span>. And Absalom, and all the men of Israel said:  The counsel of Chusai the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel:  and by the will of the Lord the profitable counsel of Achitophel was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">17:15</span>. And Chusai said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests:  Thus and thus did Achitophel counsel Absalom, and the ancients of Israel:  and thus and thus did I counsel them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">17:16</span>. Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying:  Tarry not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but without delay pass over:  lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that is with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">17:17</span>. And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel:  and there went a maid and told them:  and they went forward, to carry the message to king David, for they might not be seen, nor enter into the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-477">17:18</span>. But a certain boy saw them, and told Absalom:  but they making haste went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">17:19</span>. And a woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the well, as it were to dry sodden barley and so the thing was not known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-479">17:20</span>. And when Absalom's servants were come into the house, they said to the woman:  Where is Achimaas and Jonathan?  and the woman answered them:  They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a little water. But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-480">17:21</span>. And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on told king David, and said:  Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">17:22</span>. So David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan, until it grew light, and not one of them was left that was not gone ever the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">17:23</span>. But Achitophel seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled his ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his city, and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">17:24</span>. But David came to the camp, and Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.<br/>
<br/>
To the camp. . .The city of Mahanaim, the name of which, in Hebrew, signifies The camp.  It was a city of note at that time, as appears from its having been chosen by Isboseth for the place of his residence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">17:25</span>. Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab's stead over the army:  and Amasa was the son of a man who was called Jethra, of Jezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of Sarvia who was the mother of Joab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">17:26</span>. And Israel camped with Absalom in the land of Galaad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">17:27</span>. And when David was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammihel of Lodabar and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">17:28</span>. Brought him beds, and tapestry, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and fried pulse,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">17:29</span>. And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave to David and the people that were with him, to eat:  for they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the wilderness.<br/>

Absalom is defeated, and slain by Joab.  David mourneth for him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-491">18:1</span>. And David, having reviewed his people, appointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">18:2</span>. And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth:  and the king said to the people:  I also will go forth with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">18:3</span>. And the people answered:  Thou shalt not go forth:  for if we flee away, they will not much mind us:  or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care:  for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-494">18:4</span>. And the king said to them:  What seemeth good to you, that will I do.  And the king stood by the gate:  and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">18:5</span>. And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying:  Save me the boy Absalom.  And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">18:6</span>. So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">18:7</span>. And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">18:8</span>. And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest consumed, than whom the sword devoured that day.<br/>
<br/>
Consumed. . .Viz., by pits and precipices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">18:9</span>. And it happened that Absalom met the servants of David, riding on a mule:  and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak:  and while he hung between the heaven and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">18:10</span>. And one saw this and told Joab, saying:  I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">18:11</span>. And Joab said to the man that told him:  If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and a belt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">18:12</span>. And he said to Joab:  If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son for in our hearing the king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying:  Save me the boy Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">18:13</span>. Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">18:14</span>. And Joab said:  Not as thou wilt, but I will set upon him in thy sight.  So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom:  and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">18:15</span>. Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">18:16</span>. And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">18:17</span>. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stones upon him:  but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">18:18</span>. Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley:  for he said:  I have no son, and this shall be the monument of my name.  And he called the pillar by his own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day.<br/>
<br/>
No son. . .The sons mentioned above, chap. 14.27, were dead when this pillar was erected:  unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">18:19</span>. And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said:  I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">18:20</span>. And Joab said to him:  Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day:  this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">18:21</span>. And Joab said to Chusai:  Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen.  Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">18:22</span>. Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again:  Why might not I also run after Chusai?  And Joab said to him:  Why wilt thou run, my son?  thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">18:23</span>. He answered:  But what if I run?  And he said to him:  Run.  Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">18:24</span>. And David sat between the two gates:  and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">18:25</span>. And crying out he told the king:  and the king said:  If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth.  And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">18:26</span>. The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said:  I see another man running alone.  And the king said:  He also is a good messenger.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">18:27</span>. And the watchman said:  The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc.  And the king said:  He is a good man:  and cometh with good news.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">18:28</span>. And Achimaas crying out, said to the king:  God save thee, O king.  And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said:  Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">18:29</span>. And the king said:  Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Achimaas said:  I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant:  I know nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">18:30</span>. And the king said to him:  Pass, and stand here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-521">18:31</span>. And when he had passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared and coming up he said:  I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-522">18:32</span>. And the king said to Chusai:  Is the young man Absalom safe?  And Chusai answering him, said:  Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">18:33</span>. The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept.  And as he went he spoke in this manner:  My son Absalom, Absalom my son:  would to God that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
Would to God. . .David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died:  and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him.  In which he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him.<br/>

<br/>
David, at the remonstrances of Joab, ceaseth his mourning.  He is invited back and met by Semei and Miphiboseth:  a strife between the men of Juda and the men of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">19:1</span>. And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for his son:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">19:2</span>. And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people:  for the people heard say that day:  The king grieveth for his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">19:3</span>. And the people shunned the going into the city that day as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away from the battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">19:4</span>. And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice:  O my son Absalom, O Absalom my son, O my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">19:5</span>. Then Joab going into the house to the king, said:  Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, that have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">19:6</span>. Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee:  and thou hast shewn this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, nor for thy servants:  and I now plainly perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had been slain, then it would have pleased thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-532">19:7</span>. Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants:  for I swear to thee by the Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night:  and that will be worse to thee, than all the evils that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-533">19:8</span>. Then the king arose and sat in the gate:  and it was told to all the people that the king sat in the gate:  and all the people came before the king, but Israel fled to their own dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">19:9</span>. And all the people were at strife in all the tribes of Israel, saying:  The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines:  and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-535">19:10</span>. But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-536">19:11</span>. And king David sent to Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, saying: Speak to the ancients of Juda, saying:  Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house?  (For the talk of all Israel was come to the king in his house.)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">19:12</span>. You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you the last to bring back the king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">19:13</span>. And say ye to Amasa:  Art not thou my bone, and my flesh?  So do God to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of the army before me always in the place of Joab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-539">19:14</span>. And he inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of one man:  and they sent to the king, saying:  Return thou, and all thy servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">19:15</span>. And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">19:16</span>. And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, made haste and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">19:17</span>. With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul:  and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him: and going over the Jordan,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">19:18</span>.They passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king's household, and do according to his commandment.  And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-544">19:19</span>. Said to him:  Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the king, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-545">19:20</span>. For I thy servant acknowledge my sin:  and therefore I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come down to meet my lord the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">19:21</span>. But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said:  Shall Semei for these words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-547">19:22</span>. And David said:  What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me?  shall there any man be killed this day in Israel?  do not I know that this day I am made king over Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-548">19:23</span>. And the king said to Semei:  Thou shalt not die.  And he swore unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-549">19:24</span>. And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard:  nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his return in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-550">19:25</span>. And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him:  Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-551">19:26</span>. And he answering, said:  My lord, O king, my servant despised me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on and go with the king:  for I thy servant am lame.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-552">19:27</span>. Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my lord the king:  but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do what pleaseth thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-553">19:28</span>. For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the guests of thy table:  what just complaint therefore have I?  or what right to cry any more to the king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-554">19:29</span>. Then the king said to him:  Why speakest thou any more?  what I have said is determined:  thou and Siba divide the possessions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-555">19:30</span>. And Miphiboseth answered the king:  Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-556">19:31</span>. Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him beyond the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-557">19:32</span>. Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp:  for he was a man exceeding rich.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-558">19:33</span>. And the king said to Berzellai:  Come with me that thou mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-559">19:34</span>. And Berzellai said to the king:  How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">19:35</span>. I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet and bitter?  or can meat or drink delight thy servant?  or can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?  why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-561">19:36</span>. I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee: I need not this recompense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-562">19:37</span>. But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-563">19:38</span>. Then the king said to him:  Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-564">19:39</span>. And when all the people and the king had passed over the Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him:  and he returned to his own place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-565">19:40</span>. So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him.  Now all the people of Juda had brought the king over, and only half of the people of Israel were there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-566">19:41</span>. Therefore all the men of Israel running together to the king, said to him:  Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">19:42</span>. And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel:  Because the king is nearer to me:  why art thou angry for this matter?  have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-568">19:43</span>. And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said:  I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee:  why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king?  And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.<br/>

<br/>
Seba's rebellion.  Amasa is slain by Joab.  Abela is besieged, but upon the citizens casting over the wall the head of Seba, Joab departeth with all his army.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-571">20:1</span>. And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Seba, the son of Bochri, a man of Jemini:  and he sounded the trumpet, and said:  We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai: return to thy dwellings, O Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">20:2</span>. And all Israel departed from David, and followed Seba the son of Bochri:  but the men of Juda stuck to their king from the Jordan unto Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-573">20:3</span>. And when the king was come into his house at Jerusalem, he took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them inward, allowing them provisions:  and he went not in unto them, but they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-574">20:4</span>. And the king said to Amasa:  Assemble to me all the men of Juda against the third day, and be thou here present.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-575">20:5</span>. So Amasa went to assemble the men of Juda, but he tarried beyond the set time which the king had appointed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-576">20:6</span>. And David said to Abisai:  Now will Seba the son of Bochri do us more harm than did Absalom:  take thou therefore the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find fenced cities, and escape us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-577">20:7</span>. So Joab's men went out with him, and the Cerethi and the Phelethi:  and all the valiant men went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">20:8</span>. And when they were at the great stone which is in Gabaon, Amasa coming met them.  And Joab had on a close coat of equal length with his habit, and over it was girded with a sword hanging down to his flank, in a scabbard, made in such manner as to come out with the least motion and strike.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">20:9</span>. And Joab said to Amasa:  God save thee, my brother.  And he took Amasa by the chin with his right hand to kiss him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">20:10</span>. But Amasa did not take notice of the sword, which Joab had, and he struck him in the side, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and gave him not a second wound, and he died.  And Joab, and Abisai his brother pursued after Seba the son of Bochri.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">20:11</span>. In the mean time some men of Joab's company stopping at the dead body of Amasa, said:  Behold he that would have been in Joab's stead the companion of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">20:12</span>. And Amasa imbrued with blood, lay in the midst of the way.  A certain man saw this that all the people stood still to look upon him, so he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and covered him with a garment, that they who passed might, not stop on his account.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">20:13</span>. And when he was removed out of the way, all the people went on following Joab to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">20:14</span>. Now he had passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abela and Bethmaacha:  and all the chosen men were gathered together unto him.<br/>
<br/>
Abela and Bethmaacha. . .Cities of the tribe of Nephtali.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">20:15</span>. And they came, and besieged him in Abela, and in Bethmaacha, and they cast up works round the city, and the city was besieged:  and all the people that were with Joab, laboured to throw down the walls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">20:16</span>. And a wise woman cried out from the city:  Hear, hear, and say to Joab:  Come near hither, and I will speak with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">20:17</span>. And when he was come near to her, she said to him:  Art thou Joab?  And he answered:  I am.  And she spoke thus to him:  Hear the words of thy handmaid.  He answered:  I do hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-588">20:18</span>. And she again said:  A saying was used in the old proverb:  They that inquire, let them inquire in Abela:  and so they made an end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-589">20:19</span>. Am not I she that answer truth in Israel, and thou seekest to destroy the city, and to overthrow a mother in Israel?  Why wilt thou throw down the inheritance of the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-590">20:20</span>. And Joab answering said:  God forbid, God forbid that I should, I do not throw down, nor destroy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-591">20:21</span>. The matter is not so, but a man of mount Ephraim, Seba the son of Bochri by name, hath lifted up his hand against king David:  deliver him only, and we will depart from the city.  And the woman said to Joab: Behold his head shall be thrown to thee from the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-592">20:22</span>. So she went to all the people, and spoke to them wisely:  and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bochri, and cast it out to Joab.  And he sounded the trumpet, and they departed from the city, every one to their home:  and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-593">20:23</span>. So Joab was over all the army of Israel:  and Banaias the son of Joiada was over the Cerethites and Phelethites,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-594">20:24</span>. But Aduram over the tributes:  and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-595">20:25</span>. And Siva was scribe:  and Sadoc and Abiathar, priests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-596">20:26</span>. And Ira the Jairite was the priest of David.</p>

<br/>
A famine of three years, for the sin of Saul against the Gabaonites, at whose desire seven of Saul's race are crucified.  War again with the Philistines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-599">21:1</span>. And there was a famine in the days of David for three years successively:  and David consulted the oracle of the Lord.  And the Lord said:  It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he slow the Gabaonites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-600">21:2</span>. Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them:  (Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Amorrhites:  and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for the children of Israel and Juda:)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-601">21:3</span>. David therefore said to the Gabaonites:  What shall I do for you? and what shall be the atonement or you, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-602">21:4</span>. And the Gabaonites said to him:  We have no contest about silver and gold, but against Saul and against his house:  neither do we desire that any man be slain of Israel.  And the king said to them:  What will you then that I should do for you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-603">21:5</span>. And they said to the king:  The man that crushed us and oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-604">21:6</span>. Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify them to the Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen of the Lord. And the king said:  I will give them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-605">21:7</span>. And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord, that had been between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-606">21:8</span>. So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth:  and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi:<br/>
<br/>
Of Michol. . .They were the sons of Merob, who was married to Hadriel: but they are here called the sons of Michol, because she adopted them, and brought them up as her own.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-607">21:9</span>. And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites:  and they crucified them on a hill before the Lord:  and these seven died together in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to be reaped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-608">21:10</span>. And Respha the daughter of Aia took haircloth, and spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till water dropped upon them out of heaven:  and suffered neither the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-609">21:11</span>. And it was told David, what Respha the daughter of Aia, the concubine of Saul, had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-610">21:12</span>. And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged them when they had slain Saul in Gelboe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-611">21:13</span>. And he brought from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered up the bones of them that were crucified,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-612">21:14</span>. And they buried them with the bones of Saul, and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in the side, in the sepulchre of Cis his father:  and they did all that the king had commanded, and God shewed mercy again to the land after these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-613">21:15</span>. And the Philistines made war again against Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.  And David growing faint,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-614">21:16</span>. Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Arapha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, being girded with a new sword, attempted to kill David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-615">21:17</span>. And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking the Philistine killed him.  Then David's men swore unto him saying:  Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the lamp of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-616">21:18</span>. There was also a second battle in Gob against the Philistines: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of Arapha of the family of the giants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-617">21:19</span>. And there was a third battle in Gob against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an embroiderer of Bethlehem slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.<br/>
<br/>
Adeodatus the son of the Forrest. . .So it is rendered in the Latin Vulgate, by giving the interpretation of the Hebrew names, which are Elhanan the son of Jaare.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">21:20</span>. A fourth battle was in Geth:  where there was a man of great stature, that had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, four and twenty in all, and he was of the race of Arapha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">21:21</span>. And he reproached Israel:  and Jonathan the son of Samae the brother of David slew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-620">21:22</span>. These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by the hand of David, and of his servants.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-625">22:3</span>. God is my strong one, in him will I trust:  my shield, and the horn of my salvation:  he lifteth me up, and is my refuge:  my saviour, thou wilt deliver me from iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-626">22:4</span>. I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised:  and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">22:5</span>. For the pangs of death have surrounded me:  the floods of Belial have made me afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-628">22:6</span>. The cords of hell compassed me:  the snares of death prevented me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">22:7</span>. In my distress I will call upon the Lord, and I will cry to my God:  and he will hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come to his ears.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">22:8</span>. The earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was angry with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">22:9</span>. A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a devouring fire out of his mouth:  coals were kindled by it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">22:10</span>. He bowed the heavens, and came down:  and darkness was under his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">22:11</span>. And he rode upon the cherubims, and flew:  and slid upon the wings of the wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-634">22:12</span>. He made darkness a covering round about him:  dropping waters out of the clouds of the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-635">22:13</span>. By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were kindled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-636">22:14</span>. The Lord shall thunder from heaven:  and the most high shall give forth his voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-637">22:15</span>. He shot arrows and scattered them:  lightning, and consumed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-638">22:16</span>. And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the spirit of his wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-639">22:17</span>. He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of many waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">22:18</span>. He delivered me from my most mighty enemy, and from them that hated me:  for they were too strong for me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-641">22:19</span>. He prevented me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord became my stay.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">22:20</span>. And he brought me forth into a large place, he delivered me, because I pleased him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">22:21</span>. The Lord will reward me according to my justice:  and according to the cleanness of my hands he will render to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-644">22:22</span>. Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-645">22:23</span>. For all his judgments are in my sight:  and his precepts I have not removed from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">22:24</span>. And I shall be perfect with him:  and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">22:25</span>. And the Lord will recompense me according to my justice:  and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">22:26</span>. With the holy one thou wilt be holy:  and with the valiant perfect.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">22:40</span>. Thou hast girded me with strength to battle:  thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">22:41</span>. My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me:  them that hated me, and I shall destroy them.<br/>

<br/>
The last words of David.  A catalogue of his valiant men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">23:1</span>. Now these are David's last words.  David the son of Isai said:  The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">23:2</span>. The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">23:3</span>. The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">23:4</span>. As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain.<br/>
<br/>
As the light, etc. . .So shall be the kingdom of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">23:5</span>. Neither is my house so great with God, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured.  For he is all my salvation, and all my will:  neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is my house, etc. . .As if he should say:  This everlasting covenant was not due to my house:  but purely owing to his bounty; who is all my salvation, and my will:  that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I beseeched of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">23:6</span>. But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">23:7</span>. And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with the staff of a lance:  but they shall be set on fire and burnt to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">23:8</span>. These are the names of the valiant men of David:  Jesbaham sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one onset.<br/>
<br/>
Jesbaham. . .The son of Hachamoni.  For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chron. or Paralip. 11.--Ibid.  Most tender, etc. . .He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong.  It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the name itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his valour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">23:9</span>. After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the Philistines, and they were there gathered together to battle.<br/>
<br/>
Dodo. . .In Latin, Patrui ejus, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo.  The same occurs in ver. 24.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">23:10</span>. And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day:  and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">23:11</span>. And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari.  And the Philistines were gathered together in a troop:  for there was a field full of lentils.  And when the people were fled from the face of the Philistines,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">23:12</span>. He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and defeated the Philistines:  and the Lord gave a great victory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">23:13</span>. Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam:  and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">23:14</span>. And David was then in a hold:  and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">23:15</span>. And David longed, and said:  O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">23:16</span>. And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David:  but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">23:17</span>. Saying:  The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives?  therefore he would not drink.  These things did these three mighty men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">23:18</span>. Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three:  and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">23:19</span>. And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three first he attained not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">23:20</span>. And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel:  he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">23:21</span>. He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand:  but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">23:22</span>. These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">23:23</span>. And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty:  but he attained not to the first three:  and David made him of his privy council.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">23:24</span>. Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem.<br/>

David numbereth the people:  God sendeth a pestilence, which is stopt by David's prayer and sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">24:1</span>. And the anger of the Lord was again kindled against Israel, and stirred up David among them, saying:  Go, number Israel and Juda.<br/>
<br/>
Stirred up, etc. . .This stirring up was not the doing of God, but of Satan; as it is expressly declared, 1 Chron. or Paralip. 21.1.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">24:2</span>. And the king said to Joab the general of his army:  Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and number ye the people that I may know the number of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">24:3</span>. And Joab said to the king:  The Lord thy God increase thy people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again multiply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king:  but what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-720">24:4</span>. But the king's words prevailed over the words of Joab, and of the captains of the army:  and Joab, and the captains of the soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-721">24:5</span>. And when they had passed the Jordan, they came to Aroer to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of Gad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-722">24:6</span>. And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of Dan.  And going about by Sidon,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">24:7</span>. They passed near the walls of Tyre, and all the land of the Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and they came to the south of Juda into Bersabee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">24:8</span>. And having gone through the whole land, after nine months and twenty days, they came to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">24:9</span>. And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king, and there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword:  and of Juda five hundred thousand fighting men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">24:10</span>. But David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered: and David said to the Lord:  I have sinned very much in what I have done:  but I pray thee, O Lord, to take away the iniquity of thy servant, because I have done exceeding foolishly.<br/>
<br/>
David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered. . .That is he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride which had put him upon numbering the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">24:11</span>. And David arose in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-728">24:12</span>. Go, and say to David:  Thus saith the Lord:  I give thee thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">24:13</span>. And when Gad was come to David, he told him, saying:  Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land:  or thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy land.  Now therefore deliberate, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">24:14</span>. And David said to Gad:  I am in a great strait:  but it is better that I should fall into the hands of the Lord (for his mercies are many) than into the hands of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-731">24:15</span>. And the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning unto the time appointed, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersabee seventy thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">24:16</span>. And when the angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction, and said to the angel that slew the people:  It is enough:  now hold thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">24:17</span>. And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people:  It is I; I am he that have sinned, I have done wickedly:  these that are the sheep, what have they done?  let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">24:18</span>. And Gad came to David that day, and said:  Go up, and build an altar to the Lord in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">24:19</span>. And David went up according to the word of Gad which the Lord had commanded him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">24:20</span>. And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">24:21</span>. And going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face to the earth, and said:  Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said to him:  To buy the thrashingfloor of thee, and build an altar to the Lord, that the plague, which rageth among the people, may cease.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">24:22</span>. And Areuna said to David:  Let my lord the king take, and offer, as it seemeth good to him:  thou hast here oxen for a holocaust, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">24:23</span>. All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king:  and Areuna said to the king:  The Lord thy God receive thy vow.<br/>
