<p>THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
In this Epistle, the Apostle again instructs and admonishes Timothy in what belonged to his office, as in the former; and also warns him to shun the conversation of those who had erred from the truth, describing at the same time their character, He tells him of his approaching death and desires him to come speedily to him.  It appears from this circumstance that he wrote this second Epistle in the time of his last imprisonment at Rome and not long before his martyrdom.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2 Timothy Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
He admonishes him to stir up the grace he received by his ordination and not to be discouraged at his sufferings, but to hold firm the sound doctrine of the gospel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son.  Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a pure conscience, that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice, and I am certain that in thee also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear:  but of power and of love and of sobriety.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner:  but labour with the gospel, according to the power of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not according to our own works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and incorruption by the gospel.<br/>
<br/>
By the illumination. . .That is, by the bright coming and appearing of our Saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. For which cause, I also suffer these things:  but I am not ashamed.  For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me:  in faith and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia are turned away from me:  of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus:  because he hath often refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me and found me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day. And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest.<br/>

<br/>
He exhorts him to diligence in his office and patience in suffering. The danger of the delusions of heretics.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:1</span>. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in Christ Jesus:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:2</span>. And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:3</span>. Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:4</span>. No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses:  that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:5</span>. For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:6</span>. The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:7</span>. Understand what I say:  for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:8</span>. Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:9</span>. Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer.  But the word of God is not bound.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:10</span>. Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:11</span>. A faithful saying:  for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:12</span>. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.  If we deny him, he will also deny us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:13</span>. If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:14</span>. Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words:  for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:15</span>. Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:16</span>. But shun profane and vain babblings:  for they grow much towards ungodliness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:17</span>. And their speech spreadeth like a canker:  of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:18</span>. Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:19</span>. But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:20</span>. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth:  and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:21</span>. If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:22</span>. But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:23</span>. And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:24</span>. But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle:  but be mild toward all men, apt to teach, patient,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:25</span>. With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth:  if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:26</span>. And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by whom they are held captive at his will.<br/>

<br/>
The character of heretics of latter days.  He exhorts Timothy to constancy.  Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:1</span>. Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:2</span>. Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:3</span>. Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:4</span>. Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure more than of God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:5</span>. Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power thereof.  Now these avoid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:6</span>. For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:7</span>. Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:8</span>. Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.<br/>
<br/>
Jannes and Mambres. . .The magicians of king Pharao.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:9</span>. But they shall proceed no farther:  for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:10</span>. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:11</span>. Persecutions, afflictions:  such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra:  what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:12</span>. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:13</span>. But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse:  erring, and driving into error,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:14</span>. But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and which have been committed to thee.  Knowing of whom thou hast learned them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:15</span>. And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:16</span>. All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice:<br/>
<br/>
All scripture,. . .Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable for all these ends.  But, if we would have the whole rule of Christian faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures, which Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the Old Testament alone:  nor yet with the New Testament, without taking along with it the traditions of the apostles, and the interpretation of the church, to which the apostles delivered both the book, and the true meaning of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:17</span>. That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</p>

His charge to Timothy.  He tells him of his approaching death and desires him to come to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:1</span>. I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:2</span>. Preach the word:  be instant in season, out of season:  reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:3</span>. For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:4</span>. And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:5</span>. But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.  Be sober.<br/>
<br/>
An evangelist. . .a diligent preacher of the gospel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:6</span>. For I am even now ready to be sacrificed:  and the time of my dissolution is at hand.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:8</span>. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day:  and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming.  Make haste to come to me quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:9</span>. For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:10</span>. Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:11</span>. Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark and bring him with thee:  for he is profitable to me for the ministry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:12</span>. But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:13</span>. The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee:  and the books, especially the parchments.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:17</span>. But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear.  And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:18</span>. The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom.  To whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.<br/>
