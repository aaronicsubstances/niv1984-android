St. John praises Gaius for his walking in truth and for his charity,<br/>

to Demetrius.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3 John Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The Ancient, to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well, as thy soul doth
prosperously.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk in truth.<br/>
<br/>
No greater grace. . .that is nothing that gives me greater joy and satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the brethren:  and that for strangers,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church.  Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a
manner worthy of God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
Taking nothing of the Gentiles. . .These ministers of the gospel are commended by St. John, who took nothing from the Gentiles, lest they
should seem to preach in order to get money by it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. We therefore ought to receive such:  that we may be fellow helpers of the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. I had written perhaps to the church:  but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.<br/>
<br/>
Diotrephes who loveth. . .This man seemeth to be in power, but not a friend to the faithful; therefore this part of the letter might be an
admonition to him from the apostle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:11</span>. Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil:  but that which is good.  He that doth good is of God:  he that doth evil hath not seen God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:12</span>. To Demetrius, testimony is given by all, and by the truth itself: yea and we also give testimony.  And thou knowest that our testimony is
true.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:13</span>. I had many things to write unto thee:  but I would not by ink and pen write to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:14</span>. But I hope speedily to see thee:  and we will speak mouth to mouth.  Peace be to thee.  Our friends salute thee.  Salute the friends
by name.</p>
