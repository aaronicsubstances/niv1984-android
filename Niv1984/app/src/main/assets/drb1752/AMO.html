<p>THE PROPHECY OF AMOS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
AMOS prophesied in Israel about the same time as OSEE:  and was called from following the cattle to denounce GOD'S judgments to the people of Israel, and the neighbouring nations, for their repeated crimes, in which they continued without repentance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Amos Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The prophet threatens Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon with the judgments of God, for their obstinacy in sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Thecua:  which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two years before the earthquake.<br/>
<br/>
The earthquake. . .Many understand this of a great earthquake, which they say was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer incense in the temple.  But the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here spoken of must have been before that time:  because Jeroboam the second, under whom Amos prophesied, was dead long before that attempt of Ozias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. And he said:  The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem:  and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned, and the top of Carmel is withered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Damascus, and for four I will not convert it:  because they have thrashed Galaad with iron wains.<br/>
<br/>
For three crimes--and for four. . .That is, for their many unrepented of crimes.--Ibid.  I will not convert it. . .That is, I will not spare them, nor turn away the punishments I design to inflict upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the houses of Benadad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And I will break the bar of Damascus:  and I will cut off the inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of pleasure:  and the people of Syria shall be carried away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Gaza, and for four I will not convert it:  because they have carried away a perfect captivity to shut them up in Edom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the houses thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon:  and I will turn my hand against Accaron, and the rest of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Tyre, and for four I will not convert it:  because they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom, and have not remembered the covenant of brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the houses thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Edom, and for four I will not convert him:  because he hath pursued his brother with the sword, and hath carried on his fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. I will send a fire into Theman:  and it shall devour the houses of Bosra.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four I will not convert him:  because he hath ripped up the women with child of Galaad to enlarge his border.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba:  and it shall devour the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle, and with a whirlwind in the day of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And Melchom shall go into captivity, both he, and his princes together, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Melchom. . .The god or idol of the Ammonites, otherwise called Moloch, and Melech:  which in Hebrew signifies a king, and Melchom their king.<br/>

<p><b>Amos Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-18"/>
</b><br/>
The judgments with which God threatens Moab, Juda, and Israel for their sins, and their ingratitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">2:1</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Moab, and for four I will not convert him:  because he hath burnt the bones of the king of Edom even to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:2</span>. And I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the houses of Carioth:  and Moab shall die with a noise, with the sound of the trumpet:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:3</span>. And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all his princes with him, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:4</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Juda, and for four I will not convert him:  because he hath cast away the law of the Lord, and hath not kept his commandments:  for their idols have caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:5</span>. And I will send a fire into Juda, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:6</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  For three crimes of Israel, and for four I will not convert him:  because he hath sold the just man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of shoes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:7</span>. They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the humble:  and the son and his father have gone to the same young woman, to profane my holy name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:8</span>. And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar:  and drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:9</span>. Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face:  whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was strong as an oak:  and I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots beneath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:10</span>. It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years through the wilderness, that you might possess the land of the Amorrhite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:11</span>. And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.  Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:12</span>. And you will present wine to the Nazarites:  and command the prophets, saying:  Prophesy not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:13</span>. Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that is laden with hay.<br/>
<br/>
I will screak. . .Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your sins, etc.  The spirit of God, as St. Jerome takes notice, accommodates himself to the education of the prophet and inspires him with comparisons taken from country affairs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:14</span>. And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant shall not possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:15</span>. And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, neither shall the rider of the horse save his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:16</span>. And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away naked in that day, saith the Lord.<br/>

</b><br/>
The evils that shall fall upon Israel for their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">3:1</span>. Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O ye children of Israel:  concerning the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">3:2</span>. You only have I known of all the families of the earth:  therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.<br/>
<br/>
Visit upon. . .That is, punish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">3:3</span>. Shall two walk together except they be agreed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">3:4</span>. Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey?  will the lion's whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:5</span>. Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if there be no fowler?  Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:6</span>. Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not done?<br/>
<br/>
Evil in a city. . .He speaks of the evil of punishments of war, famine, pestilence, desolation, etc., but not of the evil of sin, of which God is not the author.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:7</span>. For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:8</span>. The lion shall roar, who will not fear?  The Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:9</span>. Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say:  Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:10</span>. And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:11</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  The land shall be in tribulation, and shall be compassed about:  and thy strength shall be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:12</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  As if a shepherd should get out of the lion's mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear:  so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a place of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:13</span>. Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God of hosts:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:14</span>. That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel:  and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:15</span>. And I will strike the winter house with the summer house:  and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith the Lord.<br/>

<p><b>Amos Chapter 4<br id="bookmark-drb1752-53"/>

The Israelites are reproved for their oppressing the poor, for their idolatry, and their incorrigibleness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">4:1</span>. Hear this word, ye fat kine that are in the mountains of Samaria: you that oppress the needy, and crush the poor:  that say to your masters:  Bring, and we will drink.<br/>
<br/>
Fat kine. . .He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">4:2</span>. The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and what shall remain of you in boiling pots.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">4:3</span>. And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other, and you shall be cast forth into Armon, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Armon. . .A foreign country; some understand it of Armenia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">4:4</span>. Come ye to Bethel, and do wickedly:  to Galgal, and multiply transgressions:  and bring in the morning your victims, your tithes in three days.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">4:7</span>. I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest:  and I caused it to rain upon on city, and caused it not to rain upon another city:  one piece was rained upon:  and the piece whereupon I rained not, withered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">4:8</span>. And two and three cities went to one city to drink water, and were not filled:  yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">4:11</span>. I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning:  yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.<br/>

A lamentation for Israel:  an exhortation to return to God.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">5:2</span>. The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">5:4</span>. For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel:  Seek ye me, and you shall live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">5:5</span>. But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee:  for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.<br/>

Bethel,--Galgal,--Bersabee. . .The places where they worshipped their idols.<br/>

<p><b>Amos Chapter 7<br id="bookmark-drb1752-114"/>
</b><br/>
The prophet sees, in three visions, evils coming upon Israel:  he is accused of treason by the false priest of Bethel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">7:1</span>. These things the Lord God shewed to me:  and behold the locust was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king's mowing.<br/>
<br/>
The locust, etc. . .These judgments by locusts and fire, which, by the prophet's intercession, were moderated, signify the former invasions of the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalasar, before the utter desolation of Israel by Salmanasar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">7:2</span>. And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, I said:  O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee:  who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">7:3</span>. The Lord had pity upon this:  It shall not be, said the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">7:4</span>. These things the Lord God shewed to me:  and behold the Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a part at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">7:5</span>. And I said:  O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little one?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">7:6</span>. The Lord had pity upon this.  Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">7:7</span>. These things the Lord shewed to me:  and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason's trowel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">7:8</span>. And the Lord said to me:  What seest thou, Amos?  And I said:  A mason's trowel.  And the Lord said:  Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel.  I will plaster them over no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">7:9</span>. And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste:  and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">7:10</span>. And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying:  Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel:  the land is not able to bear all his words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">7:11</span>. For thus saith Amos:  Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own land.<br/>
<br/>
Jeroboam shall die by the sword. . .The prophet did not say this; but that the Lord would rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword:  which was verified, when Zacharias, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was slain by the sword.  4 Kings 15.10.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">7:12</span>. And Amasias said to Amos:  Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda:  and eat bread there, and prophesy there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">7:13</span>. But prophesy not again any more in Bethel:  because it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">7:14</span>. And Amos answered and said to Amasias:  I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet:  but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a prophet. . .That is, I am not a prophet by education:  nor is prophesying my calling or profession:  but I am a herdsman, whom God was pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">7:15</span>. And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me:  Go, prophesy to my people Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">7:16</span>. And now hear thou the word of the Lord:  Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the house of the idol.<br/>
<br/>
The house of the idol. . .Viz., of the calf worshipped in Bethel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">7:17</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord:  Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line:  and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land.</p>

<p><b>Amos Chapter 8<br id="bookmark-drb1752-133"/>

Under the figure of a hook, which bringeth down the fruit, the approaching desolation of Israel is foreshewed for their avarice and injustices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">8:1</span>. These things the Lord shewed to me:  and behold a hook to draw down the fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">8:2</span>. And he said:  What seest thou, Amos?  And I said:  A hook to draw down fruit.  And the Lord said to me:  The end is come upon my people Israel:  I will not again pass by them any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">8:3</span>. And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the Lord God:  many shall die:  silence shall be cast in every place.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">8:5</span>. Saying:  When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn:  that we may lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">8:6</span>. That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">8:7</span>. The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob:  surely I will never forget all their works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">8:8</span>. Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein:  and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">8:9</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">8:10</span>. And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation:  and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head:  and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">8:11</span>. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land:  not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">8:12</span>. And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east:  they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.<br/>

The certainty of the desolation of Israel:  the restoring of the tabernacle of David, and the conversion of the Gentiles to the church; which shall flourish for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">9:1</span>. I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said:  Strike the hinges, and let the lintels be shook:  for there is covetousness in the head of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall be no flight for them:  they shall flee, and he that shall flee of them shall not be delivered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">9:2</span>. Though they go down even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them out:  and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">9:3</span>. And though they be hid in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them away from thence:  and though they hide themselves from my eyes in the depth of the sea, there will I command the serpent and he shall bite them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">9:4</span>. And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall kill them.  And I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">9:5</span>. And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth, and it shall melt:  and all that dwell therein shall mourn:  and it shall rise up as a river, and shall run down as the river of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">9:6</span>. He that buildeth his ascension in heaven, and hath founded his bundle upon the earth:  who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name.<br/>
<br/>
His ascension. . .That is, his high throne.--Ibid.  His bundle. . .That is, his church bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">9:7</span>. Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord?  did not I bring up Israel, out of the land of Egypt:  and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of Cyrene?<br/>
<br/>
As the children of the Ethiopians. . .That is, as black as they, by your iniquities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">9:8</span>. Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth:  but yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">9:14</span>. And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel:  and they shall build the abandoned cities, and inhabit them:  and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them:  and shall make gardens, and eat the fruits of them.
