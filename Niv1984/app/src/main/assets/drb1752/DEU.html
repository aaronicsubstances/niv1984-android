<p>THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is called DEUTERONOMY, which signifies a SECOND LAW, because it repeats and inculcates the ordinances formerly given on mount Sinai, with other precepts not expressed before.  The Hebrews, from the first words in the book, call it ELLE
HADDEBARIM.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Deuteronomy Chapter 1</b><br/>
<br/>
A repetition of what passed at Sinai and Cadesbarne:  and of the people's murmuring and their punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Cadesbarne.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon:  and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab.  And Moses began to expound the law, and to say:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying:  You have stayed long enough in this mountain:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you:  go in and possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And I said to you at that time:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. I alone am not able to bear you:  for the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. (The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands, and bless you as he hath spoken.)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you and your differences.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Let me have from among you wise and understanding men, and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I may appoint them your rulers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Then you answered me:  The thing is good which thou meanest to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And I commanded them, saying:  Hear them, and judge that which is just:  whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great:  neither shall you respect any man's person, because it is the judgment of God.  And if any thing seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And I commanded you all things that you were to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And departing from Horeb, we passed through the terrible and vast wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite, as the Lord our God had commanded us.  And when we were come into Cadesbarne,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. I said to you:  You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee:  go up and possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers:  fear not, nor be any way discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. And you came all to me, and said:  Let us send men who may view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one of every tribe:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster:  and having viewed the land,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought them to us, and said:  The land is good, which the Lord our God will give us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. You murmured in your tents, and said:  The Lord hateth us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. Whither shall we go up?  the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying:  The multitude is very great, and taller than we:  the cities are great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there.<br/>
<br/>
Walled up to the sky. . .A figurative expression, signifying the walls to be very high.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. And I said to you:  Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as he did in Egypt in the sight of all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">1:32</span>. And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">1:33</span>. Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">1:34</span>. And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry and swore, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">1:35</span>. Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good land, which I promised with an oath to your fathers:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">1:36</span>. Except Caleb the son of Jephone:  for he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath followed the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">1:37</span>. Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at, since the Lord was angry with me also on your account, and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">1:38</span>. But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">1:39</span>. Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil, they shall go in:  and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">1:40</span>. But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">1:41</span>. And you answered me:  We have sinned against the Lord:  we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded.  And when you went ready armed unto the mountain,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">1:42</span>. The Lord said to me:  Say to them:  Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you:  lest you fall before your enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">1:43</span>. I spoke, and you hearkened not:  but resisting the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">1:44</span>. And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do:  and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">1:45</span>. And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard you not, neither would he yield to your voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">1:46</span>. So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time.</p>

<p><b>Deuteronomy Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-49"/>
<br/>
They are forbid to fight against the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. Their victory over Sehon king of Hesebon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:1</span>. And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me:  and we compassed mount Seir a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:2</span>. And the Lord said to me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:3</span>. You have compassed this mountain long enough:  go toward the north:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:4</span>. And command thou the people, saying:  You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:5</span>. Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them.  For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:6</span>. You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat:  you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:7</span>. The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands:  the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:8</span>. And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:9</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Fight not against the Moabites, neither go to battle against them:  for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">2:10</span>. The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">2:11</span>. They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims.  But the Moabites call them Emims.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">2:12</span>. The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir:  who being driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">2:13</span>. Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">2:14</span>. And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years:  until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp, as the Lord had sworn:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">2:15</span>. For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">2:16</span>. And after all the fighting men were dead,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">2:17</span>. The Lord spoke to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">2:18</span>. Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">2:19</span>. And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle:  for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">2:20</span>. It was accounted a land of giants:  and giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">2:21</span>. A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face:  and he made them to dwell in their stead,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">2:22</span>. As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">2:23</span>. The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappadocians:  who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">2:24</span>. Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon:  Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">2:25</span>. This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven:  that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">2:26</span>. So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">2:27</span>. We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">2:28</span>. Sell us meat for money, that we may eat:  give us water for money and so we will drink.  We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">2:29</span>. As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar:  until we come to the Jordan, and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">2:30</span>. And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass:  because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.<br/>
<br/>
Hardened, etc. . .That is, in punishment of his past sins he left him to his own stubborn and perverse disposition, which drew him to his ruin. See the note on Ex. 7.3.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">2:31</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">2:32</span>. And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">2:33</span>. And the Lord our God delivered him to us:  and we slew him with his sons and all his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">2:34</span>. And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and women and children.  We left nothing of them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">2:35</span>. Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">2:36</span>. From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad.  There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands:  the Lord our God delivered all unto us:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">2:37</span>. Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached not:  and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us.<br/>

<br/>
The victory over Og king of Basan.  Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses receive their possession on the other side of Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">3:1</span>. Then we turned and went by the way of Basan:  and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">3:2</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Fear him not:  because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land:  and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">3:3</span>. So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also, the king of Basan, and all his people:  and we utterly destroyed them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">3:4</span>. Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that escaped us:  sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">3:5</span>. All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, besides innumerable towns that had no walls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">3:6</span>. And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">3:7</span>. But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">3:8</span>. And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan:  from the torrent Arnon unto the mount Hermon,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">3:9</span>. Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">3:10</span>. All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">3:11</span>. For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants.  His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man's hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">3:12</span>. And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, unto the half of mount Galaad:  and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">3:13</span>. And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">3:14</span>. Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati.  And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">3:15</span>. To Machir also I gave Galaad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">3:16</span>. And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Arnon, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">3:17</span>. And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">3:18</span>. And I commanded you at that time, saying:  The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">3:19</span>. Leaving your wives and children and cattle.  For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">3:20</span>. Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you:  and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan:  then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">3:21</span>. I commanded Josue also at that time, saying:  Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings:  so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">3:22</span>. Fear them not:  for the Lord your God will fight for you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">3:23</span>. And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">3:24</span>. Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">3:25</span>. I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">3:26</span>. And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me:  It is enough:  speak no more to me of this matter.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">4:27</span>. And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a few among the nations, to which the Lord shall lead you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">4:28</span>. And there you shall serve gods, that were framed with men's hands:  wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">4:30</span>. After all the things aforesaid shall find thee, in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">4:31</span>. Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God:  he will not leave thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he swore to thy fathers.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">4:37</span>. Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them. And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great power,<br/>

Graven things. . .Idols, so called by contempt.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-290">9:8</span>. For in Horeb, also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and would have destroyed thee,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-292">9:10</span>. And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled together.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-303">9:21</span>. And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-304">9:22</span>. At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the graves of lust you provoked the Lord:<br/>

There shall be no poor, etc. . .It is not to be understood as a promise, that there should be no poor in Israel, as appears from ver. 11, where we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for their charity:  but it is an ordinance that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of poverty and want.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">15:18</span>. Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling:  that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that thou dost.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">15:19</span>. Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex.  Thou shalt not work with the firstling of a bullock, and thou shalt not shear the firstlings of thy sheep.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">15:20</span>. In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year, in the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy house.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">28:32</span>. May thy sons and thy daughters be given to another people, thy eyes looking on, and languishing at the sight of them all the day, and may there be no strength in thy hand.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-842">28:68</span>. The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt, by the way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more.  There shalt thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.<br/>

<p><b>Deuteronomy Chapter 29</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-844"/>
<br/>
The covenant is solemnly confirmed between God and his people.  Threats against those that shall break it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-845">29:1</span>. These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab:  beside that covenant which he made with them in Horeb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">29:2</span>. And Moses called all Israel, and said to them:  You have seen all the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">29:3</span>. The great temptations, which thy eyes have seen, those mighty signs and wonders,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">29:4</span>. And the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand, and eyes to see, and ears that may hear, unto this present day.<br/>
<br/>
Hath not given you, etc. . .Through your own fault and because you resisted his grace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">29:5</span>. He hath brought you forty years through the desert:  your garments are not worn out, neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">29:6</span>. You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink:  that you might know that I am the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">29:7</span>. And you came to this place:  and Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, came out against us to fight.  And we slew them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">29:8</span>. And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to Ruben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">29:9</span>. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfil them:  that you may understand all that you do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">29:10</span>. You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes, and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">29:11</span>. Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp, besides the hewers of wood, and them that bring water:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">29:12</span>. That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">29:13</span>. That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">29:14</span>. Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these oaths,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-859">29:15</span>. But with all that are present and that are absent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-860">29:16</span>. For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">29:17</span>. You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">29:18</span>. Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations:  and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">29:19</span>. And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless himself in his heart saying:  I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart:  and the drunken may consume the thirsty,<br/>
<br/>
The drunken, etc., absumat ebria sitientem. . .It is a proverbial expression, which may either be understood, as spoken by the sinner, blessing, that is, flattering himself in his sins with the imagination of peace, and so great an abundance as may satisfy, and as it were, consume all thirst and want:  or it may be referred to the root of bitterness, spoken of before, which being drunken with sin may attract, and by that means consume, such as thirst after the like evils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">29:20</span>. And the Lord should not forgive him:  but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him:  and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">29:21</span>. And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel, according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-866">29:22</span>. And the following generation shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-867">29:23</span>. Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">29:24</span>. And all the nations shall say:  Why hath the Lord done thus to this land?  what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">29:25</span>. And they shall answer:  Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">29:26</span>. And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">29:27</span>. Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">29:28</span>. And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">29:29</span>. Secret things to the Lord our God:  things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.<br/>
<br/>
Secret things, etc. . .As much as to say, secret things belong to, and are known to, God alone; our business must be to observe what he has revealed and manifested to us, and to direct our lives accordingly.<br/>

Great mercies are promised to the penitent:  God's commandment is feasible.  Life and death are set before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-876">30:1</span>. Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-877">30:2</span>. And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-878">30:3</span>. The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into which he scattered thee before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">30:4</span>. If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from hence,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">30:7</span>. And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them that hate and persecute thee.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">30:9</span>. And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things.  For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he rejoiced in thy fathers:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">30:10</span>. Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law:  and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">30:11</span>. This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above thee, nor far off from thee:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-894">30:19</span>. I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing.  Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live:<br/>

And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them.<br/>

<p><b>Deuteronomy Chapter 31</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-897"/>
<br/>
Moses encourageth the people, and Josue, who is appointed to succeed him.  He delivereth the law to the priests.  God foretelleth that the people will often forsake him, and that he will punish them.  He commandeth Moses to write a canticle, as a constant remembrancer of the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-898">31:1</span>. And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-899">31:2</span>. And he said to them:  I am this day a hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the Lord also hath said to me:  Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-900">31:3</span>. The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee:  he will destroy all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them:  and this Josue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-901">31:4</span>. And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-902">31:5</span>. Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you, you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-903">31:6</span>. Do manfully and be of good heart:  fear not, nor be ye dismayed at their sight:  for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader, and will not leave thee nor forsake thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-904">31:7</span>. And Moses called Josue, and said to him before all Israel:  Take courage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring this people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers, and thou shalt divide it by lot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-905">31:8</span>. And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with thee:  he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee:  fear not, neither be dismayed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-906">31:9</span>. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the ancients of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-907">31:10</span>. And he commanded them, saying:  After seven years, in the year of remission, in the feast of tabernacles,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-908">31:11</span>. When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou shalt read the words of this law before all Israel, in their hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-909">31:12</span>. And the people being all assembled together, both men and women, children and strangers, that are within thy gates:  that hearing they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and fulfil all the words of this law:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-910">31:13</span>. That their children also, who now are ignorant, may hear, and fear the Lord their God, all the days that they live in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-911">31:14</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold the days of thy death are nigh:  call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony, that I may give him a charge.  So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-912">31:15</span>. And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud, which stood in the entry of the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-913">31:16</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell:  there will they forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-914">31:17</span>. And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day:  and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured:  all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day:  In truth it is because God is not with me, that these evils have found me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-915">31:18</span>. But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the evils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-916">31:19</span>. Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of Israel:  that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-917">31:20</span>. For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey.  And when they have eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will serve them:  and will despise me, and make void my covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-918">31:21</span>. And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed.  For I know their thoughts, and what they are about to do this day, before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-919">31:22</span>. Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-920">31:23</span>. And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said:  Take courage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-921">31:24</span>. Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-922">31:25</span>. He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-923">31:26</span>. Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God:  that it may be there for a testimony against thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-924">31:27</span>. For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck.  While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord:  how much more when I shall be dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-925">31:28</span>. Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-926">31:29</span>. For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you:  and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-927">31:30</span>. Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-928-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Deuteronomy Chapter 32</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-929"/>
<br/>
A canticle for the remembrance of the law.  Moses is commanded to go up into a mountain, from whence he shall see the promised land but not enter into it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-930">32:1</span>. Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-931">32:2</span>. Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-932">32:3</span>. Because I will invoke the name of the Lord:  give ye magnificence to our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-933">32:4</span>. The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments:  God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-934">32:5</span>. They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in their filth:  they are a wicked and perverse generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-935">32:6</span>. Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people?  Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-936">32:7</span>. Remember the days of old, think upon every generation:  ask thy father, and he will declare to thee:  thy elders and they will tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-937">32:8</span>. When the Most High divided the nations:  when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-938">32:9</span>. But the Lord's portion is his people:  Jacob the lot of his inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-939">32:10</span>. He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness:  he led him about, and taught him:  and he kept him as the apple of his eye.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-940">32:11</span>. As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-941">32:12</span>. The Lord alone was his leader:  and there was no strange god with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-942">32:13</span>. He set him upon high land:  that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-943">32:14</span>. Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan:  and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-944">32:15</span>. The beloved grew fat, and kicked:  he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-945">32:16</span>. They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-946">32:17</span>. They sacrificed to devils and not to God:  to gods whom they knew not:  that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-947">32:18</span>. Thou hast forsaken the God that begot thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-948">32:19</span>. The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath:  because his own sons and daughters provoked him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-949">32:20</span>. And he said:  I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be:  for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-950">32:21</span>. They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities:  and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-951">32:22</span>. A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell:  and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-952">32:23</span>. I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-953">32:24</span>. They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite:  I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-954">32:25</span>. Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-955">32:26</span>. I said:  Where are they?  I will make the memory of them to cease from among men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-956">32:27</span>. But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it:  lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say:  Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-957">32:28</span>. They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-958">32:29</span>. O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-959">32:30</span>. How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand?  Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-960">32:31</span>. For our God is not as their gods:  our enemies themselves are judges.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-961">32:32</span>. Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha:  their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-962">32:33</span>. Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-963">32:34</span>. Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">32:35</span>. Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide:  the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">32:36</span>. The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants:  he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-966">32:37</span>. And he shall say:  Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-967">32:38</span>. Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings:  let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">32:39</span>. See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me:  I will kill and I will make to live:  I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">32:40</span>. I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say:  I live for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">32:41</span>. If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment:  I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">32:42</span>. I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">32:43</span>. Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants:  and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">32:44</span>. So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-974">32:45</span>. And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">32:46</span>. And he said to them:  Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day:  which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-976">32:47</span>. For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-977">32:48</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-978">32:49</span>. Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho:  and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">32:50</span>. When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">32:51</span>. Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction, in Cades of the desert of Sin:  and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">32:52</span>. Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.<br/>

Moses before his death blesseth the tribes of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-984">33:1</span>. This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God, Moses, blessed the children of Israel, before his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-985">33:2</span>. And he said:  The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he rose up to us:  he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of saints.  In his right hand a fiery law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-986">33:3</span>. He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand:  and they that approach to his feet, shall receive of his doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">33:4</span>. Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">33:5</span>. He shall be king with the most right, the princes of the people, being assembled with the tribes of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">33:6</span>. Let Ruben live, and not die, and be he small in number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-990">33:7</span>. This is the blessing of Juda.  Hear, O Lord, the voice of Juda, and bring him in unto his people:  his hands shall fight for him, and he shall be his helper against his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-991">33:8</span>. To Levi also he said:  Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be to thy holy man, whom thou hast proved in the temptation, and judged at the waters of contradiction:<br/>
<br/>
Holy man. . .Aaron and his successors in the priesthood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">33:9</span>. Who hath said to his father, and to his mother:  I do not know you; and to his brethren:  I know you not:  and their own children they have not known.  These have kept thy word, and observed thy covenant,<br/>
<br/>
Who hath said, etc. . .It is the duty of the priestly tribe to prefer God's honour and service before all considerations of flesh and blood: in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin, when these would withdraw them from the business of their calling.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">33:10</span>. Thy judgments, O Jacob, and thy law, O Israel:  they shall put incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">33:11</span>. Bless, O Lord, his strength, and receive the works of his hands. Strike the backs of his enemies, and let not them that hate him rise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">33:12</span>. And to Benjamin he said:  The best beloved of the Lord shall dwell confidently in him:  as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the day long, and between his shoulders shall be rest.<br/>
<br/>
Shall dwell, etc. . .This seems to allude to the temple being built in the confines of the tribe of Benjamin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">33:13</span>. To Joseph also he said:  Of the blessing of the Lord be his land, of the fruits of heaven, and of the dew, and of the deep that lieth beneath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">33:14</span>. Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-999">33:16</span>. And of the fruits of the earth, and of the fulness thereof.  The blessing of him that appeared in the bush, come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
The Nazarite. . .See the note on Gen. 49.26.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1000">33:17</span>. His beauty as of the firstling of a bullock, his horns as the horns of a rhinoceros:  with them shall he push the nations even to the ends of the earth.  These are the multitudes of Ephraim and these the thousands of Manasses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1001">33:18</span>. And to Zabulon he said:  Rejoice, O Zabulon, in thy going out; and Issachar in thy tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1002">33:19</span>. They shall call the people to the mountain:  there shall they sacrifice the victims of justice.  Who shall suck as milk the abundance of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1003">33:20</span>. And to Gad he said:  Blessed be Gad in his breadth:  he hath rested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head.<br/>
<br/>

He saw, etc. . .The pre-eminence of the tribe of Gad, to which this alludeth, was their having the lawgiver Moses buried in their borders; though the particular place was not known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1005">33:22</span>. To Dan also he said:  Dan is a young lion, he shall flow plentifully from Basan.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1006">33:23</span>. And To Nephtali he said:  Nephtali shall enjoy abundance, and shall be full of the blessings of the Lord:  he shall possess the sea and the south.<br/>
<br/>
The sea. . .The lake of Genesareth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1007">33:24</span>. To Aser also he said:  Let Aser be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.<br/>

<p><b>Deuteronomy Chapter 34</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-1014"/>
<br/>
Moses seeth the promised land, but is not suffered to go into it.  He dieth at the age of 120 years.  God burieth his body secretly, and all Israel mourn for him thirty days.  Josue, replenished (by imposition of Moses's hands) with the spirit of God, succeedeth.  But Moses, for his special familiarity with God, and for most wonderful miracles, is commended above all other prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1015">34:1</span>. Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount Nebo, to the top of Phasga over against Jericho:  and the Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1016">34:2</span>. And all Nephtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and all the land of Juda unto the furthermost sea,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1017">34:3</span>. And the south part, and the breadth of the plain of Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Segor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1018">34:4</span>. And the Lord said to him:  This is the land, for which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying:  I will give it to thy seed.  Thou hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1019">34:5</span>. And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, by the commandment of the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
Died there. . .This last chapter of Deuteronomy, in which the death of Moses is related, was written by Josue, or by some of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1020">34:6</span>. And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over against Phogor:  and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day.<br/>
<br/>
He buried him, viz. . .by the ministry of angels, and would have the place of his burial to be unknown, lest the Israelites, who were so prone to idolatry, might worship him with divine honours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1021">34:7</span>. Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died:  his eye was not dim, neither were his teeth moved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1022">34:8</span>. And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab thirty days:  and the days of their mourning in which they mourned Moses were ended.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1023">34:9</span>. And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands upon him.  And the children of Israel obeyed him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1024">34:10</span>. And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1025">34:11</span>. In all the signs and wonders, which he sent by him, to do in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1026">34:12</span>. And all the mighty hand, and great miracles, which Moses did before all Israel.<br/>
