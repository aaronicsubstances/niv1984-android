<p>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
Ephesus was the capital of Lesser Asia, and celebrated for the temple of Diana, to which the most part of the people of the East went frequently to worship.  But St. Paul having preached the Gospel there, for two years the first time and afterwards for about a year, converted many.  He wrote this Epistle to them when he was a prisoner in Rome; and sent it by Tychicus.  He admonishes them to hold firmly the faith which they had received and warns them, and also those of the neighbouring cities, against the sophistry of philosophers and doctrine of false teachers who were come among them.  The matters of faith contained in this Epistle are exceedingly sublime, and consequently very difficult to be understood.  It was written about twenty-nine years after our Lord's Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Ephesians Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The great blessings we have received through Christ.  He is the head of all the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Grace be to you and peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ:<br/>
<br/>
In heavenly places. . .or, in heavenly things.  In coelestibus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself:  according to the purpose of his will:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us, in his beloved son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his, grace,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Which hath superabounded in us, in all wisdom and prudence,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. That we may be unto the praise of his glory:  we who before hoped in Christ:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation), in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory.<br/>
<br/>
Acquisition. . .that is, a purchased possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Wherefore, I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus and of your love towards all the saints,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. The eyes of your heart enlightened that you may know what the hope is of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the dead and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. Above all principality and power and virtue and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. And he hath subjected all things under his feet and hath made him head over all the church,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. Which is his body and the fulness of him who is filled all in all.</p>

</b><br/>
All our good comes through Christ.  He is our peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:1</span>. And you, when you were dead in your offences and sins,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:2</span>. Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:3</span>. In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:4</span>. But God (who is rich in mercy) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:5</span>. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in Christ (by whose grace you are saved)<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:8</span>. For by grace you are saved through faith:  and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:9</span>. Not of works, that no man may glory.<br/>
<br/>
Not of works. . .as of our own growth, or from ourselves; but as from the grace of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:10</span>. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:11</span>. For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore gentiles is the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:12</span>. That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise and without God in this world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:13</span>. But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:14</span>. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:15</span>. Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees:  that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:16</span>. And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:17</span>. And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off:  and peace to them that were nigh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:18</span>. For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:19</span>. Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners:  but you are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:20</span>. Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:<br/>

The mystery hidden from former ages was discovered to the apostle, to be imparted to the Gentiles.  He prays that they may be strengthened in God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:1</span>. For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:2</span>. If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:3</span>. How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:4</span>. As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:5</span>. Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:6</span>. That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body:  and copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:7</span>. Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:8</span>. To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:9</span>. And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God who created all things:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:6</span>. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:8</span>. Wherefore he saith:  Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts to men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:9</span>. Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:10</span>. He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens:  that he might fill all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:11</span>. And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors:<br/>
<br/>
Gave some apostles--Until we all meet, etc. . .Here it is plainly expressed, that Christ has left in his church a perpetual succession of orthodox pastors and teachers, to preserve the faithful in unity and truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:12</span>. For the perfecting of the saints, for the word of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:13</span>. Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:14</span>. That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:23</span>. Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church.  He is the saviour of his body.<br/>

As the church is subject to Christ. . .The church then, according to St. Paul, is ever obedient to Christ, and can never fall from him, but remain faithful to him, unspotted and unchanged to the end of the world.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:25</span>. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">5:26</span>. That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">5:27</span>. That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">5:28</span>. So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.  He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">5:29</span>. For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">5:30</span>. Because we are members of him, body, of his flesh and of his bones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">5:31</span>. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother:  and shall cleave to his wife.  And they shall be two in one flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:32</span>. This is a great sacrament:  but I speak in Christ and in the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">5:33</span>. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love for his wife as himself:  And let the wife fear her husband.<br/>

<p><b>Ephesians Chapter 6<br id="bookmark-drb1752-142"/>
</b><br/>
Duties of children and servants.  The Christian's armour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">6:1</span>. Children, obey your parents in the Lord:  for this is just.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">6:2</span>. Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">6:3</span>. That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">6:4</span>. And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger:  but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">6:5</span>. Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">6:6</span>. Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men:  but, as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">6:7</span>. With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:8</span>. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">6:9</span>. And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings:  knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven. And there is no respect of persons with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:10</span>. Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord and in the might of his power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:11</span>. Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:12</span>. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.<br/>
<br/>
High places, or heavenly places. . .That is to say, in the air, the lowest of the celestial regions; in which God permits these wicked spirits or fallen angels to wander.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:13</span>. Therefore, take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day and to stand in all things perfect.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:14</span>. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of justice:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:15</span>. And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">6:16</span>. In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">6:17</span>. And take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">6:18</span>. By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit:  and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:19</span>. And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:20</span>. For which I am an ambassador in a chain:  so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">6:21</span>. But that you also may know the things that concern me and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">6:22</span>. Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose:  that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">6:23</span>. Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">6:24</span>. Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.  Amen.<br/>
<br/>
In incorruption. . .That is, with a pure and perfect love.</p>
