<p>THE BOOK OF EXODUS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
The Second Book of Moses is called EXODUS, from the Greek word EXODOS, which signifies going out:  because it contains the history of the going out of the children of Israel out of Egypt.  The Hebrews, from the words with which it begins, call it VEELLE SEMOTH:  These are the names.  It contains transactions for 145 years; that is, from the death of Joseph to the erecting of the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Exodus Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The Israelites are multiplied in Egypt.  They are oppressed by a new king, who commandeth all their male children to be killed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob:  they went in every man with his household:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And he said to his people:  Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply:  and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens:  and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.<br/>
<br/>
Of tabernacles. . .Or, of storehouses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews:  of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. Commanding them:  When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come:  if it be a man child, kill it:  if a woman, keep it alive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>:  And the king called for them and said:  What is it that you meant to do, that you would save the men children?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. They answered:  The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives:  and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.<br/>
<br/>
Because the midwives feared God, etc. . .The midwives were rewarded, not for their lie, which was a venial sin; but for their fear of God, and their humanity:  but this reward was only temporal, in building them houses, that is, in establishing and enriching their families.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying:  Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river:  whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.<br/>
</p>

<p><b>Exodus Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-25"/>
</b><br/>
Moses is born and exposed on the bank of the river; where he is taken up by the daughter of
Pharao, and adopted for her son.  He killeth an Egyptian, and fleeth into Madian; where he marrieth a wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:1</span>. After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:2</span>. And she conceived, and bore a son:  and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:3</span>. And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch:  and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:4</span>. His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:5</span>. And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river:  and her maids walked by the river's brink.  And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it:  and when it was brought,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:6</span>. She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said:  This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:7</span>. And the child's sister said to her:  Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:8</span>. She answered:  Go.  The maid went and called her mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:9</span>. And Pharao's daughter said to her:  Take this child, and nurse him for me:  I will give thee thy wages.  The woman took and nursed the child:  and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:10</span>. And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.<br/>
<br/>
Moses. . .Or Moyses, in the Egyptian tongue, signifies one taken or saved out of the water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:11</span>. In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren:  and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:12</span>. And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
He slew the Egyptian. . .This he did by a particular inspiration of God; as a prelude to his delivering the people from their oppression and bondage.  He thought, says St. Stephen, Acts 7.25, that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them.  But such particular and extraordinary examples are not to be imitated.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:13</span>. And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling:  and he said to him that did the wrong:  Why strikest thou thy
neighbour?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:14</span>. But he answered:  Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us?  wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian?  Moses feared, and said:  How is this come to be known?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:15</span>. And Pharao heard of this word, and sought to kill Moses:  but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of
Madian, and he sat down by a well.<br/>
<br/>
Madian. . .A city and country of Arabia, which took its name from Madian the son of Abraham, by
Cetura, and was peopled by his posterity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:16</span>. And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water:  and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:17</span>. And the shepherds came and drove them away:  and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:18</span>:  And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?<br/>
<br/>
Raguel. . .He had two names, being also called Jethro, as appears from the first verse of the following chapter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:19</span>. They answered:  A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds:  and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:20</span>. But he said:  Where is he?  why have you let the man go?  call him that he may eat bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:21</span>. And Moses swore that he would dwell with him.  And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:22</span>. And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying:  I have been a stranger in a foreign country.  And she bore another, whom he called
Eliezer, saying:  For the God of my father, my helper, hath delivered me out of the hand of
Pharao.<br/>
<br/>
Gersam. . .Or Gershom.  This name signifies a stranger there:  as Eliezer signifies the help of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:23</span>. Now after a long time the king of Egypt died:  and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works:  and their cry went up unto God from the works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:24</span>. And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:25</span>. And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.<br/>
<br/>
Knew them. . .That is, he had respect to them, he cast a merciful eye upon them.<br/>

<p><b>Exodus Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-52"/>
</b><br/>
God appeareth to Moses in a bush, and sendeth him to deliver Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:1</span>. Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro, his father in law, the priest of Madian:  and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:2</span>. And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush:  and he saw that the bush was on fire, and was not burnt.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord appeared. . .That is, an angel representing God, and speaking in his name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:3</span>. And Moses said:  I will go, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:4</span>. And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush.  and said:  Moses, Moses.  And he answered:  Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:5</span>. And he said:  Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet; for the place, whereon thou standest, is holy ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:6</span>. And he said:  I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  Moses hid his face:  for he durst not look at God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:7</span>. And the Lord said to him:  I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:8</span>. And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:9</span>. For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me:  and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:10</span>. But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:11</span>. And Moses said to God:  Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:12</span>. And he said to him:  I will be with thee; and this thou shalt have for a sign that I have sent thee:  When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:13</span>. Moses said to God:  Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them:  The God of your fathers hath sent me to you.  If they shall say to me:  What is his name?  What shall I say to them?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:14</span>. God said to Moses:  I AM WHO AM.  He said:  Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel:  HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.<br/>
<br/>
I am who am. . .That is, I am being itself, eternal, self-existent, independent, infinite; without beginning, end, or change; and the source of all other beings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:15</span>. And God said again to Moses:  Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel:  The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent me to you; this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:16</span>. Go and gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying:  Visiting I have visited you; and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:17</span>. And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:18</span>:  And they shall hear thy voice; and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us; we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:19</span>. But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:20</span>. For I will stretch forth my hand, and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them:  after these he will let you go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:21</span>. And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians:  and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:22</span>. But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment:  and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Shall spoil, etc. . .That is, you shall strip, and take away the goods of the Egyptians.  This was not authorizing theft or injustice; but was a just disposal made by Him, who is the great lord and master of all things, in order to pay the children of Israel some part of what was due to them from the Egyptians for their labours.<br/>

<br/>
Moses is empowered to confirm his mission with miracles:  his brother Aaron is appointed to assist him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:1</span>. Moses answered, and said:  They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say:  The Lord hath not appeared to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:2</span>. Then he said to him:  What is that thou holdest in thy hand?  He answered:  A rod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:3</span>. And the Lord said:  Cast it down upon the ground.  He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moses fled from it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:4</span>. And the Lord said:  Put out thy hand, and take it by the tail.  He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:5</span>. That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:6</span>. And the Lord said again:  Put thy hand into thy bosom.  And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:7</span>. And he said:  Put back thy hand into thy bosom.  He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:8</span>. If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:9</span>. But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice:  take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river, shall be turned into blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:10</span>. Moses said:  I beseech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before; and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:11</span>. The Lord said to him:  Who made man's mouth?  or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind?  did not I?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:12</span>. Go therefore, and I will be in thy mouth; and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:13</span>. But he said:  I beseech thee, Lord, send whom thou wilt send.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:14</span>. The Lord being angry at Moses, said:  Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent:  behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee, shall be glad at heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:15</span>. Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth:  and I will be in thy mouth, and in his month, and will shew you what you must do.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">4:16</span>. He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth:  but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">4:17</span>. And take this rod in thy hand.  wherewith thou shalt do the signs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">4:18</span>:  Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him; I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive.  And Jethro said to him:  Go in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">4:19</span>. And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian:  Go, and return into Egypt; for they are all dead that sought thy life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">4:20</span>. Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass; and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">4:21</span>. And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt:  See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand:  I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.<br/>
<br/>
I shall harden, etc. . .Not by being the efficient cause of his sin; but by withdrawing from him, for his just punishment, the dew of grace that might have softened his heart; and so suffering him to grow harder and harder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">4:22</span>. And thou shalt say to him:  Thus saith the Lord:  Israel is my son, my firstborn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">4:23</span>. I have said to thee:  Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go:  behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">4:24</span>. And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord met him, and would have killed him. . .This was an angel representing the Lord, who treated Moses in this manner, for having neglected the circumcision of his younger son; which his wife understanding, circumcised her child upon the spot, upon which the angel let Moses go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">4:25</span>. Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and touched his feet, and said:  A bloody spouse art thou to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:26</span>. And he let him go after she had said:  A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:27</span>. And the Lord said to Aaron:  Go into the desert to meet Moses.  And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">4:28</span>. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">4:29</span>. And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">4:30</span>. And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">4:31</span>. And the people believed.  And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">5:1</span>. After these things, Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharao: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  Let my people go, that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">5:2</span>. But he answered:  Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go?  I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">5:3</span>. And they said:  The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness, and to sacrifice to the Lord our God; lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">5:4</span>. The king of Egypt said to them:  Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works?  Get you gone to your burdens.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">5:5</span>. And Pharao said:  The people of the land are numerous; you see that the multitude is increased; how much more if you give them rest from their works?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">5:6</span>. Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the task-masters of the people, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">5:7</span>. You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before; but let them go and gather straw.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">5:8</span>. And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before; neither shall you diminish any thing thereof, for they are idle, and therefore they cry.  saying:  Let us go and sacrifice to our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">5:9</span>. Let them be oppressed with works, and let them fulfil them; that they may not regard lying words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">5:10</span>. And the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters, went out and said to the people:  Thus saith Pharao:  I allow you no straw;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">5:11</span>. Go, and gather it where you can find it; neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">5:12</span>. And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">5:13</span>. And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying:  Fulfil your work every day, as before ye were wont to do, when straw was given you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">5:14</span>. And they that were over the works of the children of Israel, were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying:  Why have you not made up the task of bricks, both yesterday and to day, as before?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:15</span>. And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying:  Why dealest thou so with thy servants?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:16</span>. Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before; behold we, thy servants, are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:17</span>. And he said:  You are idle, and therefore you say:  Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:18</span>:  Go therefore and work:  straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:19</span>. And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them:  There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:20</span>. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:21</span>. And they said to them:  The Lord see and judge, because you have, made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword, to kill us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:22</span>. And Moses returned to the Lord, and said:  Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people?  wherefore hast thou sent me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:23</span>. For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people:  and thou hast not delivered them.<br/>

<br/>
God reneweth his promise.  The genealogies of Ruben, Simon and Levi, down to Moses and Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
6;1. And the Lord said to Moses:  Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao:  for by a mighty hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">6:2</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  I am the Lord<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">6:3</span>. That appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty:  and my name ADONAI I did not shew them.<br/>
<br/>
My name Adonai. . .The name, which is in the Hebrew text, is that most proper name of God, which signifieth his eternal, self-existent being, Ex. 3.14, which the Jews out of reverence never pronounce; but, instead of it, whenever it occurs in the Bible, they read Adonai, which signifies the Lord; and, therefore, they put the points or vowels, which belong to the name Adonai, to the four letters of that other ineffable name Jod, He, Vau, He.  Hence some moderns have framed the name Jehovah, unknown to all the ancients, whether Jews or Christians; for the true pronunciation of the name, which is in the Hebrew text, by long disuse, is now quite lost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">6:4</span>. And I made a covenant with them, to give them the land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">6:5</span>. I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them:  and I have remembered my covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">6:6</span>. Therefore say to the children of Israel:  I am the Lord who will bring you out from the work-prison of the Egyptians, and will deliver you from bondage:  and redeem you with a high arm, and great judgments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">6:7</span>. And I will take you to myself for my people, I will be your God: and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the work-prison of the Egyptians:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">6:8</span>. And brought you into the land, concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:  and I will give it you to possess:  I am the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">6:9</span>. And Moses told all this to the children of Israel:  but they did not hearken to him, for anguish of spirit, and most painful work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">6:10</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>

<br/>
Uncircumcised lips. . .So he calls the defect he had in his words, or utterance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">6:13</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and he gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharao the king of Egypt, that they should bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.<br/>

Moses and Aaron go into Pharao:  they turn the rod into a serpent; and the waters of Egypt into blood, which was the first plague.  The magicians do the like, and Pharao's heart is hardened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:1</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold, I have appointed thee the god of Pharao; and Aaron, thy brother, shall be thy prophet.<br/>
<br/>
The god of Pharao. . .Viz., to be his judge; and to exercise a divine power, as God's instrument, over him and his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">7:2</span>. Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee; and he shall speak to Pharao, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.<br/>

<br/>
I shall harden, etc. . .not by being the efficient cause of his hardness of heart, but by permitting it; and by withdrawing grace from him, in punishment of his malice; which alone was the proper cause of his being hardened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">7:4</span>. And he will not hear you:  and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and will bring forth my army and my people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by very great judgments.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">7:6</span>. And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded; so did they.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">7:7</span>. And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharao.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">7:8</span>. And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">7:9</span>. When Pharao shall say to you, Shew signs; thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharao, and it shall be turned into a serpent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">7:10</span>. So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as the Lord had commanded.  And Aaron took the rod before Pharao and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">7:11</span>. And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians; and they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets, did in like manner.<br/>

Magicians. . .Jannes, and Mambres, or Jambres, 2 Tim. 3.8.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">7:17</span>. Thus therefore saith the Lord:  In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord:  behold I will strike with the rod, that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.<br/>

The Lord also said to Moses:  Say to Aaron, Take thy rod; and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be turned into blood:  and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">7:20</span>. And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded:  and lifting up the rod, he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants:  and it was turned into blood.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">7:21</span>. And the fishes that were in the river died; and the river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">7:22</span>. And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in like manner; and Pharao's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">7:23</span>. And he turned himself away, and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to it this time also.<br/>

The second plague is of frogs:  Pharao promiseth to let the Israelites go, but breaketh his promise.  The third plague is of sciniphs.  The fourth is of flies.  Pharao again promiseth to dismiss the people, but doth it not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">8:1</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Go in to Pharao, and thou shalt say to him:  Thus saith the Lord:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<br/>

And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs; which shall come up and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">8:4</span>. And the frogs shall come in to thee, and to thy people, and to all thy servants.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">8:6</span>. And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">8:7</span>. And the magicians also, by their enchantments, did in like manner, and they brought forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">8:8</span>. But Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them:  Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Pray ye to the Lord, etc. . .By this it appears, that though the magicians, by the help of the devil, could bring frogs, yet they could not take them away:  God being pleased to abridge in this the power of Satan.  So we see they could not afterwards produce the lesser insects; and in this restraint of the power of the devil, were forced to acknowledge the finger of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">8:9</span>. And Moses said to Pharao:  Set me a time when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and may remain only in the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-202">8:10</span>. And he answered:  To morrow.  But he said:  I will do according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like to the Lord our God.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-204">8:12</span>. And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao:  and Moses cried to the Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharao concerning the frogs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-205">8:13</span>. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses:  and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">8:14</span>. And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land was corrupted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">8:15</span>. And Pharao seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart, and did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.<br/>
<br/>
Pharao hardened his own heart. . .By this we see that Pharao was himself the efficient cause of his heart being hardened, and not God.--See the same repeated in ver. 32.  Pharao hardened his heart at this time also: likewise chap. 9.7, 35, and chap. 13.15.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">8:16</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Say to Aaron:  Stretch forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth; and may there be sciniphs in all the land of Egypt.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-209">8:17</span>. And they did so.  And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rod; and he struck the dust of the earth, and there came sciniphs on men and on beasts:  all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs through all the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">8:18</span>:  And the magicians with their enchantments practised in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not:  and there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">8:19</span>. And the magicians said to Pharao:  This is the finger of God.  And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">8:20</span>. The Lord also said to Moses:  Arise early, and stand before Pharao; for he will go forth to the waters:  and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">8:26</span>. And Moses said:  It cannot be so:  for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God:  now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship, in their presence, they will stone us.<br/>
<br/>
The abominations, etc. . .That is, the things they worship for Gods: oxen, rams, etc.  It is the usual style of the scriptures to call all idols and false gods, abominations, to signify how much the people of God ought to detest and abhor them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">8:27</span>. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness; and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">8:29</span>. And Moses said:  I will go out from thee, and will pray to the Lord:  and the flies shall depart from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people to morrow:  but do not deceive any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">8:30</span>. So Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to the Lord.<br/>

The fifth plague is a murrain among the cattle.  The sixth, of boils in men and beasts.  The seventh, of hail.  Pharao promiseth again to let the people go, and breaketh his word.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">9:1</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Go in to Pharao, and speak to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">9:6</span>. The Lord therefore did this thing the next day:  and all the beasts of the Egyptians died, but of the beasts of the children of Israel there died not one.<br/>
<br/>
All the beasts. . .That is, many of all kinds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">9:7</span>. And Pharao sent to see; and there was not any thing dead of that which Israel possessed.  And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.<br/>

Send therefore now presently, and gather together thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for men and beasts, and all things that shall be found abroad, and not gathered together out of the fields which the hail shall fall upon, shall die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">9:20</span>. He that feared the word of the Lord among Pharao's servants, made his servants and his cattle flee into houses:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">9:24</span>. And the hail and fire mixt with it drove on together:  and it was of so great bigness, as never before was seen in the whole land of Egypt since that nation was founded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">9:25</span>. And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt all things that were in the fields, both man and beast:  and the hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of the country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">9:26</span>. Only in the land of Gessen, where the children of Israel were, the hail fell not.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">9:33</span>. And when Moses was gone from Pharao out of the city, he stretched forth his hands to the Lord:  and the thunders and the hail ceased, neither did there drop any more rain upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">9:34</span>. And Pharao seeing that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders were ceased, increased his sin:<br/>

And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Egyptians:  such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day.  And he turned himself away, and went forth from Pharao.<br/>

<br/>
Sprinkle, etc. . .This sprinkling the doors of the Israelites with the blood of the paschal lamb, in order to their being delivered from the sword of the destroying angel, was a lively figure of our redemption by the blood of Christ.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-333">12:27</span>. You shall say to them:  It is the victim of the passage of the Lord, when he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, striking the Egyptians, and saving our houses.  And the people bowing themselves, adored.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-334">12:28</span>. And the children of Israel going forth, did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">12:29</span>. And it came to pass at midnight, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharao, who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive woman that was in the prison, and all the firstborn of cattle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-336">12:30</span>. And Pharao arose in the night, and all his servants, and all Egypt:  and there arose a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house wherein there lay not one dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-337">12:31</span>. And Pharao calling Moses and Aaron, in the night, said:  Arise and go forth from among my people, you and the children of Israel:  go, sacrifice to the Lord as you say.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">12:32</span>. Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you demanded, and departing bless me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-339">12:33</span>. And the Egyptians pressed the people to go forth out of the land speedily, saying:  We shall all die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-340">12:34</span>. The people therefore took dough before it was leavened; and tying it in their cloaks, put it on their shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-341">12:35</span>. And the children of Israel did as Moses had commanded:  and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver and gold, and very much raiment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-342">12:36</span>. And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them:  and they stripped the Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-343">12:37</span>. And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse to Socoth, being about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">12:38</span>. And a mixed multitude, without number, went up also with them, sheep and herds, and beasts of divers kinds, exceeding many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">12:39</span>. And they baked the meal, which a little before they had brought out of Egypt in dough:  and they made hearth cakes unleavened:  for it could not be leavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart, and not suffering them to make any stay; neither did they think of preparing any meat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-346">12:40</span>. And the abode of the children of Israel that they made in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-347">12:41</span>. Which being expired, the same day all the army of the Lord went forth out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-348">12:42</span>. This is the observable night of the Lord, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:  this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">12:43</span>. And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:  This is the service of the Phase; no foreigner shall eat of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">12:44</span>. But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so shall eat.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">12:48</span>. And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner:  and he shall be as he that is born in the land:  but if any man be uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">12:49</span>. The same law shall be to him that is born in the land, and to the proselyte that sojourneth with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">12:50</span>. And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.<br/>

Sanctify unto me every firstborn. . .Sanctification in this place means that the firstborn males of the Hebrews should be deputed to the ministry in the divine worship; and the firstborn of beasts to be given for a sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">13:3</span>. And Moses said to the people:  Remember this day in which you came forth out of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage, for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought you forth out of this place:  that you eat no leavened bread.<br/>

For when Pharao was hardened, and would not let us go, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beasts:  therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb of the male sex, and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.<br/>

Pharao pursueth the children of Israel.  They murmur against Moses, but are encouraged by him, and pass through the Red Sea.  Pharao and his army following them are drowned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">14:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">14:2</span>. Speak to the children of Israel:  Let them turn and encamp over against Phihahiroth, which is between Magdal and the sea over against Beelsephon:  you shall encamp before it upon the sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">14:3</span>. And Pharao will say of the children of Israel:  They are straitened in the land, the desert hath shut them in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">14:4</span>. And I shall harden his heart and he will pursue you:  and I shall be glorified in Pharao, and in all his army:  and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord.  And they did so.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">14:5</span>. And it was told the king of the Egyptians that the people was fled:  and the heart of Pharao and of his servants was changed with regard to the people, and they said:  What meant we to do, that we let Israel go from serving us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">14:6</span>. So he made ready his chariot, and took all his people with him.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">14:8</span>. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; but they were gone forth in a mighty hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">14:9</span>. And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone before, they found them encamped at the sea side:  all Pharao's horse and chariots and the whole army were in Phihahiroth, before Beelsephon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">14:10</span>. And when Pharao drew near, the children of Israel lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians behind them:  and they feared exceedingly, and cried to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">14:11</span>. And they said to Moses:  Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt, therefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness:  why wouldst thou do this, to lead us out of Egypt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">14:12</span>. Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying: Depart from us, that we may serve the Egyptians?  for it was much better to serve them, than to die in the wilderness.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">14:21</span>. And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea, the Lord took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing all the night, and turned it into dry ground:  and the water was divided.<br/>

And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place:  and as the Egyptians were fleeing away, the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">14:28</span>. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them, neither did there so much as one of them remain.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">15:23</span>. And they came into Mara, and they could not drink the waters of Mara because they were bitter:  whereupon he gave a name also agreeable to the place, calling it Mara, that is, bitterness.<br/>

The people murmur for want of meat:  God giveth them quails and manna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">16:1</span>. And they set forward from Elim, and all the multitude of the children of Israel came into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai:  the fifteenth day of the second month, after they came out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">16:2</span>. And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">16:3</span>. And the children of Israel said to them:  Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat over the fleshpots, and ate bread to the full:  Why have you brought us into this desert, that you might destroy all the multitude with famine?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">16:4</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you; let the people go forth, and gather what is sufficient for every day:  that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law, or not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">16:5</span>. But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in:  and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">16:6</span>. And Moses and Aaron said to the children of Israel In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath brought you forth out of the land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">16:7</span>. And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord:  for he hath heard your murmuring against the Lord:  but as for us, what are we, that you mutter against us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">16:8</span>. And Moses said:  In the evening the Lord will give you flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full:  for he hath heard your murmurings, with which you have murmured against him, for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">16:9</span>. Moses also said to Aaron:  Say to the whole congregation of the children of Israel:  Come before the Lord; for he hath heard your murmuring.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">16:10</span>. And when Aaron spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness; and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">16:11</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">16:12</span>. I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel, say to them:  In the evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-458">16:13</span>. So it came to pass in the evening, that quails coming up, covered the camp:  and in the morning a dew lay round about the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">16:14</span>. And when it had covered the face of the earth, it appeared in the wilderness small, and as it were beaten with a pestle, like unto the hoar frost on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">16:15</span>. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another:  Manhu! which signifieth:  What is this! for they knew not what it was.  And Moses said to them:  This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">16:16</span>. This is the word that the Lord hath commanded:  Let every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat; a gomor for every man, according to the number of your souls that dwell in a tent, so shall you take of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">16:17</span>. And the children of Israel did so:  and they gathered, one more, another less.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">16:18</span>:  And they measured by the measure of a gomor:  neither had he more that had gathered more; nor did he find less that had provided less: but every one had gathered, according to what they were able to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">16:19</span>. And Moses said to them:  Let no man leave thereof till the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">16:20</span>. And they hearkened not to him, but some of them left until the morning, and it began to be full of worms, and it putrified, and Moses was angry with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">16:21</span>. Now every one of them gathered in the morning, as much as might suffice to eat:  and after the sun grew hot, it melted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">16:22</span>. But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much, that is, two gomors every man:  and all the rulers of the multitude came, and told Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">16:23</span>. And he said to them:  This is what the Lord hath spoken:  To morrow is the rest of the sabbath sanctified to the Lord.  Whatsoever work is to be done, do it; and the meats that are to be dressed, dress them; and whatsoever shall remain, lay it up until the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">16:24</span>. And they did so as Moses had commanded, and it did not putrify, neither was there worm found in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">16:25</span>. And Moses said:  Eat it to day, because it is the sabbath of the Lord:  to day it shall not be found in the field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">16:26</span>. Gather it six days; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord, therefore it shall not be found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">16:27</span>. And the seventh day came; and some of the people going forth to gather, found none.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">16:28</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  How long will you refuse to keep my commandments, and my law?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">16:29</span>. See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, and for this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision:  let each man stay at home, and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">16:30</span>. And the people kept the sabbath on the seventh day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">16:31</span>. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna:  and it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste thereof like to flour with honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-477">16:32</span>. And Moses said:  This is the word which the Lord hath commanded: Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto generations to come hereafter; that they may know the bread, wherewith I fed you in the wilderness when you were brought forth out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">16:33</span>. And Moses said to Aaron:  Take a vessel, and put manna into it, as much as a gomor can hold; and lay it up before the Lord, to keep unto your generations,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-479">16:34</span>. As the Lord commanded Moses.  And Aaron put it in the tabernacle to be kept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-480">16:35</span>. And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land:  with this meat were they fed, until they reached the borders of the land of Chanaan.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">17:1</span>. Then all the multitude of the children of Israel setting forward from the desert of Sin, by their mansions, according to the word of the Lord, encamped in Raphidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">17:2</span>. And they chode with Moses, and said:  Give us water, that we may drink.  And Moses answered them:  Why chide you with me?  Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">17:3</span>. So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying:  Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">17:4</span>. And Moses cried to the Lord, saying:  What shall I do to this people?  Yet a little more and they will stone me.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-489">17:6</span>. Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb, and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink.  Moses did so before the ancients of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-490">17:7</span>. And he called the name of that place Temptation, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted the Lord, saying:  Is the Lord amongst us or not?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">17:10</span>. Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur, went up upon the top of the hill.<br/>

The ten commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-558">20:1</span>. And the Lord spoke all these words:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-559">20:2</span>. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">20:3</span>. Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.<br/>

<br/>
A graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing, etc. . .All such images, or likenesses, are forbidden by this commandment, as are made to be adored and served; according to that which immediately follows, thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them.  That is, all such as are designed for idols or image-gods, or are worshipped with divine honour.  But otherwise images, pictures, or representations, even in the house of God, and in the very sanctuary so far from being forbidden, are expressly authorized by the word of God.  See Ex. 25.15, and etc.; chap. 38.7; Num. 21.8, 9; 1 Chron. or Paralip. 28.18, 19; 2 Chron. or Paralip. 3.10.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-562">20:5</span>. Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them:  I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-563">20:6</span>. And shewing mercy unto thousands to them that love me, and keep my commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-564">20:7</span>. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:  for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-565">20:8</span>. Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-566">20:9</span>. Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">20:10</span>. But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God:  thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-568">20:11</span>. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day:  therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">20:22</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel:  You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">20:25</span>. And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up a tool upon it, it shall be defiled.<br/>

<br/>
Moses writeth his law; and after offering sacrifices, sprinkleth the blood of the testament upon the people:  then goeth up the mountain which God covereth with a fiery cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">24:1</span>. And he said to Moses:  Come up to the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel, and you shall adore afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">24:2</span>. And Moses alone shall come up to the Lord, but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people come up with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">24:3</span>. So Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments:  and all the people answered with one voice:  We will do all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">24:4</span>. And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord:  and rising in the morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mount, and twelve titles according to the twelve tribes of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Titles. . .That is, pillars.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">24:5</span>. And he sent young men of the children of Israel, and they offered holocausts, and sacrificed pacific victims of calves to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Holocausts. . .Whole burnt offerings, in which the whole sacrifice was consumed with fire upon the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">24:6</span>. Then Moses took half of the blood, and put it into bowls; and the rest he poured upon the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">24:7</span>. And taking the book of the covenant, he read it in the hearing of the people:  and they said:  All things that the Lord hath spoken, we will do, we will be obedient.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">24:8</span>. And he took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people, and he said:  This is the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">24:9</span>. Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel went up:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">24:10</span>. And they saw the God of Israel:  and under his feet as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as the heaven, when clear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">24:11</span>. Neither did he lay his hand upon those of the children of Israel, that retired afar off, and they saw God, and they did eat and drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">24:12</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Come up to me into the mount, and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and the law, and the commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">24:13</span>. Moses rose up, and his minister Josue:  and Moses going up into the mount of God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">24:14</span>. Said to the ancients:  Wait ye here till we return to you.  You have Aaron and Hur with you:  if any question shall arise, you shall refer it to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">24:15</span>. And when Moses was gone up, a cloud covered the mount.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">24:16</span>. And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai, covering it with a cloud six days:  and the seventh day he called him out of the midst of the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-708">24:17</span>. And the sight of the glory of the Lord, was like a burning fire upon the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel.<br/>

<br/>
A propitiatory. . .a covering for the ark:  called a propitiatory, or mercy seat, because the Lord, who was supposed to sit there upon the wings of the cherubims, with the ark for his footstool, from thence shewed mercy.  It is also called the oracle, ver. 18 and 20; because from thence God gave his orders and his answers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">25:18</span>. Thou shalt make also two cherubims of beaten gold, on the two sides of the oracle.<br/>

Three cups as it were nuts to every branch, and a bowl withal, and a lily:  and three cups likewise of the fashion of nuts in the other branch, and a bowl withal, and a lily.

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-818">28:3</span>. And thou shalt speak to all the wise of heart, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's vestments, in which he being consecrated, may minister to me.<br/>

The rational of judgment. . .This part of the priest's attire, which he wore at his breast, was called the rational of judgment; partly because it admonished both priest and people of their duty to God, by carrying the names of all their tribes in his presence; and by the Urim and the Thummim, that is, doctrine and truth, which were written upon it; and partly because it gave divine answers and oracles, as if it were rational and endowed with judgment.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">28:28</span>. And may be fastened by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a violet fillet, that the joining artificially wrought may continue, and the rational and the ephod may not be loosed one from the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-844">28:29</span>. And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the rational of judgment upon his breast, when he shall enter into the sanctuary, a memorial before the Lord for ever.<br/>

And thou shalt put in the rational of judgment doctrine and truth, which shall be on Aaron's breast, when he shall go in before the Lord:  and he shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his breast, in the sight of the Lord always.<br/>
<br/>
Doctrine and Truth. . .Hebrew, Urim and Thummim:  illuminations and perfections.  These words, written on the rational, seem to signify the light of doctrine and the integrity of life, with which the priests of God ought to approach him.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">28:31</span>. And thou shalt make the tunic of the ephod all of violet,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">28:32</span>. In the midst whereof above shall be a hole for the head, and a border round about it woven, as is wont to be made in the outmost parts of garments, that it may not easily be broken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">28:33</span>. And beneath at the feet of the same tunic, round about, thou shalt make as it were pomegranates, of violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with little bells set between:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">28:34</span>. So that there shall be a golden bell and a pomegranate, and again another golden bell and a pomegranate.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">28:42</span>. Thou shalt make also linen breeches, to cover the flesh of their nakedness, from the reins to the thighs:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">28:43</span>. And Aaron and his sons shall use them when they shall go into the tabernacle of the testimony, or when they approach to the altar to minister in the sanctuary.  lest being guilty of iniquity they die.  It shall be a law for ever to Aaron, and to his seed after him.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">32:1</span>. And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, gathering together against Aaron, said:  Arise, make us gods, that may go before us:  For as to this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has befallen him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">32:2</span>. And Aaron said to them:  Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">32:3</span>. And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings to Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">32:4</span>. And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders' work, and made of them a molten calf.  And they said:  These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">32:5</span>. And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying To morrow is the solemnity of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">32:13</span>.

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-982">32:14</span>. And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">32:19</span>. And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances:  and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the mount:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">32:20</span>. And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strewed into water, and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">32:21</span>. And he said to Aaron:  What has this people done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-991">32:23</span>. They said to me:  make us gods, that may go before us; for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is befallen him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">32:24</span>. And I said to them:  Which of you hath any gold?  and they took and brought it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">32:25</span>. And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies)<br/>
<br/>
Naked. . .Having lost not only their gold, and their honour, but what was worst of all, being stripped also of the grace of God, and having lost him.--The shame of the filth. . .That is, of the idol, which they had taken for their god.  It is the usual phrase of the scripture to call idols filth and abominations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">32:26</span>. Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said:  If any man be on the Lord's side, let him join with me.  And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">32:27</span>. And he said to them:  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  Put every man his sword upon his thigh:  go, and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">32:28</span>. And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">32:29</span>. And Moses said:  You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be given to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-998">32:30</span>. And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people:  You have sinned a very great sin:  I will go up to the Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-999">32:31</span>. And returning to the Lord, he said:  I beseech thee:  this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of gold:  either forgive them this trespass,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1000">32:32</span>. Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1001">32:33</span>. And the Lord answered him:  He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1002">32:34</span>. But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee:  my angel shall go before thee.  And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1011">33:6</span>. So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments by Mount Horeb.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1013">33:8</span>. And when Moses went forth to the tabernacle, all the people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld the back of Moses, till he went into the tabernacle.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1015">33:10</span>. And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle.  And they stood and worshipped at the doors of their tent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1016">33:11</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend.  And when he returned into the camp, his servant Josue, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
Face to face. . .That is, in a most familiar manner.  Though as we learn from this very chapter, Moses could not see the face of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1017">33:12</span>. And Moses said to the Lord:  Thou commandest me to lead forth this people; and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said:  I know thee by name, and thou hast found favour in my sight.<br/>
<br/>
I know thee by name. . .In the language of the scriptures, God is said to know such as he approves and loves:  and to know by name, those whom he favours in a most singular manner, as he did his servant Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1018">33:13</span>. If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, shew me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before thy eyes:  look upon thy people this nation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1019">33:14</span>. And the Lord said:  My face shall go before thee, and I will give thee rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1020">33:15</span>. And Moses said:  If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not out of this place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1021">33:16</span>. For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people, that we have found grace in thy sight, unless thou walk with us, that we may be glorified by all people that dwell upon the earth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1022">33:17</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  This word also, which thou hast spoken, will I do; for thou hast found grace before me, and thee I have known by name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1023">33:18</span>. And he said:  Shew me thy glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1024">33:19</span>. He answered:  I will shew thee all good, and I will proclaim in the name of the Lord before thee:  and I will have mercy on whom I will, and I will be merciful to whom it shall please me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1025">33:20</span>. And again he said:  Thou canst not see my face:  for man shall not see me, and live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1026">33:21</span>. And again he said:  Behold there is a place with me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1027">33:22</span>. And when my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock, and protect thee with my righthand till I pass:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1028">33:23</span>. And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face thou canst not see.<br/>
<br/>
See my back parts. . .The Lord by his angel, usually spoke to Moses in the pillar of the cloud; so that he could not see the glory of him that spoke familiarly with him.  In the vision here mentioned he was allowed to see something of him, in an assumed corporeal form:  not in the face, the rays of which were too bright for mortal eye to bear, but to view him as it were behind, when his face was turned from him.<br/>

<p><b>Exodus Chapter 34<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1030"/>
</b><br/>
The tables are renewed:  all society with the Chanaanites is forbid: some precepts concerning the firstborn, the sabbath, and other feasts: after forty days' fast, Moses returneth to the people with the commandments, and his face appearing horned with rays of light, he covereth it, whensoever he speaketh to the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1031">34:1</span>. And after this he said:  Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the former, and I will write upon them the words, which were in the tables, which thou brokest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1032">34:2</span>. Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go up into Mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1033">34:3</span>. Let no man go up with thee, and let not any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1034">34:4</span>. Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been before; and rising very early he went up into the Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, carrying with him the tables.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1035">34:5</span>. And when the Lord was come down in a cloud, Moses stood with him, calling upon the name of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1036">34:6</span>. And when he passed before him, he said:  O the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and of much compassion, and true,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1037">34:7</span>. Who keepest mercy unto thousands:  who takest away iniquity, and wickedness, and sin, and no man of himself is innocent before thee.  Who renderest the iniquity of the fathers to the children, and to the grandchildren unto the third and fourth generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1038">34:8</span>. And Moses making haste, bowed down prostrate unto the earth, and adoring,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1039">34:9</span>. Said:  If I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, I beseech thee that thou wilt go with us, (for it is a stiffnecked people) and take away our iniquities and sin, and possess us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1040">34:10</span>. The Lord answered:  I will make a covenant in the sight of all, I will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth, nor in any nations; that this people, in the midst of whom thou art, may see the terrible work of the Lord which I will do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1041">34:11</span>. Observe all things which this day I command thee:  I myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1042">34:12</span>. Beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1044">34:14</span>. Adore not any strange god.  The Lord his name is jealous, he is a jealous God.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1045">34:15</span>. Make no covenant with the men of those countries; lest, when they have committed fornication with their gods, and have adored their idols, some one call thee to eat of the things sacrificed.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1055">34:25</span>. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon leaven; neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the solemnity of the Phase.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1058">34:28</span>. And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights:  he neither ate bread nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tables the ten words of the covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1059">34:29</span>. And when Moses came down from the Mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Horned. . .That is, shining, and sending forth rays of light like horns.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1060">34:30</span>. And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face of Moses horned, were afraid to come near.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1061">34:31</span>. And being called by him, they returned, both Aaron and the rulers of the congregation.  And after that he spoke to them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1062">34:32</span>. And all the children of Israel came to him:  and he gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord on Mount Sinai.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1065">34:35</span>. And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was horned, but he covered his face again, if at any time he spoke to them.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1105">36:1</span>. Beseleel therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1106">36:2</span>. And when Moses had called them, and every skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1107">36:3</span>. He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them.  And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1108">36:4</span>. Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1109">36:5</span>. Said to Moses:  The people offereth more than is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1110">36:6</span>. Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier's voice:  Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary.  And so they ceased from offering gifts,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1111">36:7</span>. Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1112">36:8</span>. And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1113">36:9</span>. The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four:  all the curtains were of the same size.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1114">36:10</span>. And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1115">36:11</span>. He made also loops of violet in the edge of one curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1116">36:12</span>. That the loops might meet one against another, and might be joined each with the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1117">36:13</span>. Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1118">36:14</span>. He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1119">36:15</span>. One curtain was thirty cubits long, and four cubits broad:  all the curtains were of one measure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1120">36:16</span>. Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1121">36:17</span>. And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1122">36:18</span>. And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1123">36:19</span>. He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red; and another cover over that of violet skins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1124">36:20</span>. He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1125">36:21</span>. The length of one board was ten cubits; and the breadth was one cubit and a half.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1126">36:22</span>. There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other.  And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1127">36:23</span>. Of which twenty were at the south side southward,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1128">36:24</span>. With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1129">36:25</span>. At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh towards the north, he made twenty boards,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1284">40:31</span>. He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof.  After all things were perfected,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1285">40:32</span>. The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1286">40:33</span>. Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1287">40:34</span>. If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1288">40:35</span>. If it hung over, they remained in the same place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1289">40:36</span>. For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</p>
