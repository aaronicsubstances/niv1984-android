<p>THE PROPHECY OF EZECHIEL<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
EZECHIEL, whose name signifies the STRENGTH OF GOD, was of the priestly race; and of the number of captives that were carried away to Babylon with king JOACHIN.  He was contemporary with JEREMIAS, and prophesied to the same effect in Babylon, as JEREMIAS did in Jerusalem; and is said to have ended his days in like manner, by martyrdom.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Ezechiel Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The time of Ezechiel's prophecy:  he sees a glorious vision.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God.<br/>
<br/>
The thirtieth year. . .Either of the age of Ezechiel; or, as others will have it, from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias.  4 Kings 23.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar:  and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north:  and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it:  and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance:  there was the likeness of a man in them.<br/>
<br/>
Living creatures. . .Cherubims (as appears from Ecclesiasticus 49.10) represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes, as supporting the throne of God, and as it were drawing his chariot.  All this chapter appeared so obscure, and so full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from St. Jerome, (Ep. ad Paulin.,) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides:  and they had faces, and wings on the four sides,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another.  They turned not when they went:  but every one went straight forward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And as for the likeness of their faces:  there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four:  and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four:  and the face of an eagle over all the four.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward:  two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And every one of them went straight forward:  whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went:  and they turned not when they went.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps.  This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea:  and the four had all one likeness:  and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. When they went, they went by their four parts:  and they turned not when they went.<br/>
<br/>
When they went, they went by their four parts. . .That is, indifferently to any of their sides either forward or backward:  to the right or to the left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance:  and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And, when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them:  and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Withersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it:  for the spirit of life was in the wheels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together, and followed them:  for the spirit of life was in the wheels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God:  when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was the likeness of the appearance of a man above upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about:  from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day:  this was the appearance of the brightness round about.<br/>

<p><b>Ezechiel Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-31"/>
</b><br/>
The prophet receives his commission.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:1</span>. This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord, and I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke, and he said to me:  Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:2</span>. And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet:  and I heard him speaking to me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:3</span>. And saying:  Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:4</span>. And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart:  and thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:5</span>. If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house:  and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:6</span>. And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words:  for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions.  Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks:  for they are a provoking house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:7</span>. And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear:  for they provoke me to anger.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:8</span>. But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee:  and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me:  open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:9</span>. And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up:  and he spread it before me, and it was written within and without:  and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe.<br/>
</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-41-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Ezechiel Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-42"/>
</b><br/>
The prophet eats the book, and receives further instructions:  the office of a watchman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:1</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find:  eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel. . .By this eating of the book was signified the diligent attention and affection with which we are to receive, and embrace the word of God; and to let it, as it were, sink into our interior by devout meditation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:2</span>. And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:3</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee, and I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:4</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:5</span>. For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:6</span>. Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand:  and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:7</span>. But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee:  because they will not hearken to me:  for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:8</span>. Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces:  and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:9</span>. I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint:  fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence:  for they are a provoking house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:10</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:11</span>. And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord:  If so be they will hear, and will forbear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:12</span>. And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying:  Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:13</span>. The noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:14</span>. The spirit also lifted me, and took me up:  and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit:  for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:15</span>. And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat:  and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.<br/>
<br/>
The heap of new corn. . .It was the name of a place:  in Hebrew, tel abib.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:16</span>. And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:17</span>. Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:18</span>. If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die:  thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live:  the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:19</span>. But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way:  he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:20</span>. Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity:  I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning:  he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered:  but I will require his blood at thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:21</span>. But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin:  living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:22</span>. And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me:  Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:23</span>. And I rose up, and went forth into the plain:  and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar:  and I fell upon my face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:24</span>. And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet:  and he spoke to me, and said to me:  Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:25</span>. And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them:  and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:26</span>. And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth:  because they are a provoking house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:27</span>. But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  He that heareth, let him hear:  and he that forbeareth, let him forbear:  for they are a provoking house.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:2</span>. And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:3</span>. And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city:  and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it:  it is a sign to the house of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:4</span>. And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity.<br/>

The prophet sees in a vision the abominations committed in Jerusalem; which determine the Lord to spare them no longer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">8:1</span>. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of Juda sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">8:2</span>. And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire:  from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire:  and from his loins, and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">8:3</span>. And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of my head:  and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem, near the inner gate, that looked toward the north, where was set the idol of jealousy to provoke to jealousy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">8:4</span>. And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I had seen in the plain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">8:5</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north, and I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north:  and behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy in the very entry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">8:6</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary?  and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">8:7</span>. And he brought me in to the door of the court:  and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">8:8</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, dig in the wall, and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">8:9</span>. And he said to me:  Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they commit here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">8:10</span>. And I went in and saw, and behold every form of creeping things, and of living creatures, the abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were painted on the wall all round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">8:11</span>. And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures:  and every one had a censer in his hand:  and a cloud of smoke went up from the incense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">8:12</span>. And he said to me:  Surely thou seest, O son of man, what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber:  for they say:  The Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">8:13</span>. And he said to me:  If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">8:14</span>. And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lord's house, which looked to the north:  and behold women sat there mourning for Adonis.<br/>
<br/>
Adonis. . .The favourite of Venus, slain by a wild boar, as feigned by the heathen poets, and which being here represented by an idol, is lamented by the female worshippers of that goddess.  In the Hebrew, the name is Tammuz.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">8:15</span>. And he said to me:  Surely thou hast seen, O son of man:  but turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations than these.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">8:16</span>. And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord: and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men having their backs towards the temple of the Lord, in their faces to the east:  and they adored towards the rising of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">8:17</span>. And he said to me:  Surely thou hast seen, O son of man:  is this a light thing to the house of Juda, that they should commit these abominations which they have committed here:  because they have filled the land with iniquity, and have turned to provoke me to anger?  and behold they put a branch to their nose.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">8:18</span>. Therefore I also will deal with them in my wrath:  my eye shall not spare them, neither will I shew mercy:  and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.<br/>

<br/>
Mark Thau. . .Thau, or Tau, is the last letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and signifies a sign, or a mark; which is the reason why some translators render this place set a mark, or mark a mark without specifying what this mark was.  But St. Jerome, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter Thau, which in the ancient Hebrew character, was the form of a cross.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">9:5</span>. And to the others he said in my hearing:  Go ye after him through the city, and strike:  let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">9:6</span>. Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and women:  but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary.  So they began at the ancient men who were before the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">9:7</span>. And he said to them:  Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain:  go ye forth.  And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">9:8</span>. And the slaughter being ended I was left; and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said:  Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">9:9</span>. And he said to me:  The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness:  for they have said:  The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">11:1</span>. And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun:  and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men:  and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of Banaias, princes of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">11:2</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">11:3</span>. Saying:  Were not houses lately built?  This city is the caldron, and we the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
Were not houses lately built, etc. . .These men despised the predictions and threats of the prophets; who declared to them from God, that the city should be destroyed, and the inhabitants carried into captivity: and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets, that the city, so far from being like to be destroyed, had lately been augmented by the building of new houses; from whence they further inferred, by way of a proverb, using the similitude of a cauldron, out of which the flesh is not taken, till it is thoroughly boiled, and fit to be eaten, that they should not be carried away out of their city, but there end their days in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-215">11:4</span>. Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">11:5</span>. And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me:  Speak: Thus saith the Lord:  Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">11:6</span>. You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">11:7</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, all this is the caldron:  and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">11:8</span>. You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">11:9</span>. And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">11:10</span>. You shall fall by the sword:  I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
In the borders of Israel. . .They pretended that they should die in peace in Jerusalem; God tells them it should not be so; but that they should be judged and condemned, and fall by the sword in the borders of Israel:  viz., in Reblatha in the land of Emath, where all their chief men were put to death by Nabuchodonosor.  4 Kings 25., and Jer. 52.10, 27.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">11:11</span>. This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof:  I will judge you in the borders of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">11:12</span>. And you shall know that I am the Lord:  because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">11:13</span>. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died:  and I fell down upon my face, and I cried with a loud voice:  and said:  Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God:  wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">11:14</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">11:15</span>. Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said:  Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.<br/>
<br/>
Thy brethren, etc. . .He speaks of them that had been carried away captives before; who were despised by them that remained in Jerusalem: but as the prophet here declares to them from God, should be in a more happy condition than they, and after some time return from their captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">11:16</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries:  I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">11:17</span>. Therefore speak to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">11:18</span>. And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">11:19</span>. And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels:  and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">11:20</span>. That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them:  and that they may be my people, and I may be their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">11:21</span>. But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">11:22</span>. And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them:  and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">11:23</span>. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">11:24</span>. And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God:  and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">11:25</span>. And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-320">15:2</span>. Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-322">15:4</span>. Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel:  the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes:  shall it be useful for any work?<br/>

Under the figure of an unfaithful wife, God upbraids Jerusalem with her ingratitude and manifold disloyalties:  but promiseth mercy by a new covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-329">16:1</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-330">16:2</span>. Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.<br/>
<br/>
Make known to Jerusalem. . .That is, by letters, for the prophet was then in Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-331">16:3</span>. And thou shalt say:  Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem:  Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-332">16:4</span>. And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-333">16:5</span>. No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee:  but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-334">16:6</span>. And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood:  and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood:  Live:  I have said to thee:  Live in thy blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">16:7</span>. I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field:  and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's ornament:  thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew:  and thou was naked, and full of confusion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-336">16:8</span>. And I passed by thee, and saw thee:  and behold thy time was the time of lovers:  and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy.  and I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God:  and thou becamest mine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-337">16:9</span>. And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee:  and I anointed thee with oil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">16:10</span>. And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shod thee with violet coloured shoes:  and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-339">16:11</span>. I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.<br/>
<br/>
I decked thee also with ornaments, etc. . .That is, with spiritual benefits, giving you a law with sacrifices, sacraments, and other holy rites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-340">16:12</span>. And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-341">16:13</span>. And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours:  thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful:  and wast advanced to be a queen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-342">16:14</span>. And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty:  for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-343">16:15</span>. But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">16:16</span>. And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side:  and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">16:17</span>. And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast committed fornication with them.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">16:21</span>. Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast sacrificed, etc. . .As there is nothing more base and abominable than the crimes mentioned throughout this chapter; so the infidelities of the Israelites in forsaking God, and sacrificing even their children to idols, are strongly figured by these allegories.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">16:22</span>. And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">16:25</span>. At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution:  and hast made thy beauty to be abominable:  and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">16:26</span>. And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">16:27</span>. Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification:  and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">16:28</span>. Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satisfied:  and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">16:29</span>. Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans:  and neither so wast thou satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">16:30</span>. Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith Lord God:  seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-359">16:31</span>. Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street:  and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-360">16:32</span>. But is an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">16:33</span>. Gifts are given to all harlots:  but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">16:34</span>. And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication, for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-363">16:35</span>. Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-364">16:36</span>. Thus saith the Lord God:  Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">16:37</span>. Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou hast hated:  and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">16:38</span>. And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged:  and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">16:39</span>. And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews:  and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty:  and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">16:40</span>. And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">16:41</span>. And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women:  and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">16:42</span>. And my indignation shall rest in thee:  and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">16:43</span>. Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things:  wherefore I also have turned all thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">16:44</span>. Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying:  As the mother was, so also is her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">16:45</span>. Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children:  and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children:  your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">16:46</span>. And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand:  and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">16:47</span>. But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their wickednesses:  thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">16:48</span>. As I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">16:49</span>. Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and the poor.<br/>
<br/>
This was the iniquity of Sodom, etc. . .That is, these were the steps by which the Sodomites came to fall into those abominations for which they were destroyed.  For pride, gluttony, and idleness are the highroad to all kinds of lust; especially when they are accompanied with a neglect of the works of mercy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">16:50</span>. And they were lifted up, and committed abominations before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">16:51</span>. And Samaria committed not half thy sins:  but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abominations which thou hast done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">16:52</span>. Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sins, doing more wickedly than they:  for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">16:53</span>. And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom, with her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.<br/>
<br/>
I will bring back, etc. . .This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles out of all nations, and of many of the Jews, to the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">16:54</span>. That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">16:55</span>. And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their ancient state:  and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state:  and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient state. . .That is, to their former state of liberty, and their ancient possessions.  In the spiritual sense, to the true liberty, and the happy inheritance of the children of God, through faith in Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">16:56</span>. And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day of thy pride,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">16:57</span>. Before thy malice was laid open:  as it is at this time, making thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Palestine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">16:58</span>. Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">16:59</span>. For thus saith the Lord God:  I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">16:60</span>. And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth:  and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">16:61</span>. And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed:  when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger:  and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">16:62</span>. And I will establish my covenant with thee:  and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">16:63</span>. That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.<br/>

<br/>
A large eagle. . .Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon.--Ibid.  Came to Libanus. . .That is, to Jerusalem.--Ibid.  Took away the marrow of the cedar. . .King Jechonias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">17:4</span>. He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof:  and carried it away into the land of Chanaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.<br/>

Chanaan. . .This name, which signifies traffic, is not taken here for Palestine, but for Chaldea:  and the city of merchants here mentioned is Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">17:5</span>. And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for seed, that it might take a firm root over many waters:  he planted it on the surface of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Of the seed of the land, etc. . .Viz., Sedecias, whom he made king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">17:6</span>. And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him:  and the roots thereof were under him.  So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs.<br/>
<br/>
Towards him. . .Nabuchodonosor, to whom Sedecias swore allegiance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">17:7</span>. And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers:  and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.<br/>
<br/>
Another large eagle. . .Viz., the king of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">17:8</span>. It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">17:9</span>.

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">20:1</span>. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month:  there came men of the ancients of Israel to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">20:2</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>

And say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob:  and appeared to them in the land of Egypt, and lifted up my hand for them, saying:  I am the Lord your God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">20:6</span>. In that day I lifted up my hand for them to bring them out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which excelled amongst all lands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">20:7</span>. And I said to them:  Let every man cast away the scandals of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">20:9</span>. But I did otherwise for my name's sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, in the midst of whom they were, and among whom I made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-480">20:11</span>. And I gave them my statutes, and I shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">20:12</span>. Moreover I gave them also my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them:  and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">20:13</span>. But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert:  they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a man do he shall live in them:  and they grievously violated my sabbaths.  I said therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert, and would consume them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">20:14</span>. But I spared them for the sake of my name, lest it should be profaned before the nations, from which I brought them out, in their sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">20:15</span>. So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert, not to bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-494">20:25</span>. Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments, in which they shall not live.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">20:28</span>. And I had brought them into the land, for which I lifted up my hand to give it them:  they saw every high hill, and every shady tree, and there they sacrificed their victims:  and there they presented the provocation of their offerings, and there they set their sweet odours, and poured forth their libations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">20:29</span>. And I said to them:  What meaneth the high place to which you go? and the name thereof was called High-place even to this day.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">20:34</span>. And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries, in which you are scattered, I will reign over you with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">20:35</span>. And I will bring you into the wilderness of people, and there will I plead with you face to face.<br/>
<br/>
The wilderness of people. . .That is, a desert in which there are no people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">20:36</span>. As I pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt; even so will I judge you, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">20:37</span>. And I will make you subject to my sceptre, and will bring you into the bands of the covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">20:38</span>. And I will pick out from among you the transgressors, and the wicked, and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel:  and you shall know that I am the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">20:39</span>. And as for you, O house of Israel:  thus saith the Lord God:  Walk ye every one after your idols, and serve them.  But if in this also you hear me not, but defile my holy name any more with your gifts, and with your idols;<br/>
<br/>
Walk ye every one, etc. . .It is not an allowance, much less a commandment to serve idols; but a figure of speech, by which God would have them to understand that if they would walk after their idols, they must not pretend to serve him at the same time:  for that he would by no means suffer such a mixture of worship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">20:40</span>. In my holy mountain, in the high mountain of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel serve me; all of them I say, in the land in which they shall please me, and there will I require your firstfruits, and the chief of your tithes with all your sanctifications.<br/>
<br/>
In my holy mountain, etc. . .The foregoing verse, to make the sense complete, must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture of worship which the Jews then followed.  In this verse, God promises to the true Israelites, especially to those of the Christian church, that they shall serve him in another manner, in his holy mountain, the spiritual Sion:  and shall by accepted of by him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">20:41</span>. I will accept of you for an odour of sweetness, when I shall have brought you out from the people, and shall have gathered you out of the lands into which you are scattered, and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">20:42</span>. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">20:43</span>. And there you shall remember your ways, and all your wicked doings with which you have been defiled; and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight, for all your wicked deeds which you committed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">20:44</span>. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have done well by you for my own name's sake, and not according to your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-590">23:3</span>. And they committed fornication in Egypt, in their youth they committed fornication:  there were their breasts pressed down, and the teats of their virginity were bruised.<br/>
<br/>
Committed fornication. . .That is, idolatry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-591">23:4</span>. And their names were Oolla the elder, and Ooliba her younger sister:  and I took them, and they bore sons and daughters.  Now for their names, Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba.<br/>
<br/>
Oolla and Ooliba. . .God calls the kingdom of Israel Oolla, which signifies their own habitation, because they separated themselves from his temple:  and the kingdom of Juda, Ooliba, which signifies his habitation in her, because of his temple among them in Jerusalem.<br/>

On the Assyraians, etc. . .That is, the idols of the Assyrians:  for all that is said in this chapter of the fornications of Israel and Juda, is to be understood in a spiritual sense, of their disloyalty to the Lord, by worshipping strange gods.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-595">23:8</span>. Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in Egypt:  for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured out their fornication upon her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-596">23:9</span>. Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doted.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-601">23:14</span>. And she increased her fornications:  and when she had seen men painted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">23:43</span>. And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries:  Now will this woman still continue in her fornication.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">28:3</span>. Behold thou art wiser than Daniel:  no secret is hid from thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art wiser than Daniel. . .Viz., in thy own conceit.  The wisdom of Daniel was so much celebrated in his days, that it became a proverb amongst the Chaldeans, when any one would express an extraordinary wisdom, to say he was as wise as Daniel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">28:4</span>. In thy wisdom and thy understanding thou hast made thyself strong:  and hast gotten gold an silver into thy treasures.<br/>

Thou wast the seal of resemblance. . .The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called the seal of resemblance, etc.  But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride.<br/>

A cherub stretched out. . .That is, thy wings extended.  This alludes to the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary, which with stretched out wings covered the ark.--Ibid.  The stones of fire. . .That is, bright and precious stones which sparkle like fire.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-837">31:11</span>. I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations, he shall deal with him:  I have cast him out according to his wickedness.<br/>

I have delivered. . .Here the time past is put for the future, i.  e., I shall deliver.--Ibid.  The mighty one, etc. . .Viz., Nabuchodonosor, who conquered both the Assyrians and Egyptians.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">31:12</span>. And strangers, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country:  and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and leave him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-839">31:13</span>. All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches.<br/>

For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height:  nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height:  for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down into the pit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-841">31:15</span>.

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-842">31:16</span>. I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit:  and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">31:17</span>. For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are slain by the sword; and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the nations.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">33:3</span>. And he sees the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">33:4</span>. Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, if the sword come, and cut him off:  his blood shall be upon his own head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">33:5</span>. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself, his blood shall be upon him:  but if he look to himself, he shall save his life.<br/>

And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet:  and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and cut off a soul from among them:  he indeed is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">33:7</span>. So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel:  therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-889">33:9</span>. But if thou tell the wicked man, that he may be converted from his ways, and he be not converted from his way he shall die in his iniquity:  but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-890">33:10</span>. Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel:  Thus you have spoken, saying:  Our iniquities, and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them:  how then can we live?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-891">33:11</span>. Say to them:  As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways:  and why will you die, O house of Israel?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-893">33:13</span>. Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and he, trusting in his justice, commit iniquity:  all his justices shall be forgotten, and his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall he die.<br/>

So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence:  and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.<br/>
<br/>

The prophet sees in a vision the rebuilding of the temple:  the dimensions of several parts thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1092">40:1</span>. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, the fourteenth year after the city was destroyed:  in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me thither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1093">40:2</span>. In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain:  upon which there was as the building of a city, bending towards the south.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1094">40:3</span>. And he brought me in thither, and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand, and he stood in the gate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1095">40:4</span>. And this man said to me:  Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee:  for thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee:  declare all that thou seest, to the house of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1096">40:5</span>. And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth:  and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1097">40:6</span>. And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went up the steps thereof:  and he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate one reed, that is, one threshold was one reed broad;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1098">40:7</span>. And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad: and between the little chambers were five cubits:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1132">40:41</span>. Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side at the sides of the gate were eight tables, upon which they slew the victims.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1133">40:42</span>. And the four tables for the holocausts were made of square stones:  one cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high:  to lay the vessels upon, in which the holocaust and the victim is slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1134">40:43</span>. And the borders of them were of one handbreadth, turned inwards round about:  and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1135">40:44</span>. And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singing men in the inner court, which was on the side of the gate that looketh to the north:  and their prospect was towards the south, one at the side of the east gate, which looketh toward the north.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1136">40:45</span>. And he said to me:  This chamber, which looketh toward the south shall be for the priests that watch in the wards of the temple.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1137">40:46</span>. But the chamber that looketh towards the north shall be for the priests that watch over the ministry of the altar.  These are the sons of Sadoc, who among the sons of Levi, come near to the Lord, to minister to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1138">40:47</span>. And he measured the court a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad foursquare:  and the altar that was before the face of the temple.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1148">41:6</span>. And the side chambers one by another, were twice thirty-three: and they bore outwards, that they might enter in through the wall of the house in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
One by another. . .Or one over another; literally, side to side, or side upon side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1149">41:7</span>. And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round: therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts:  and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1150">41:8</span>. And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six cubits:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1151">41:9</span>. And the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without, which was five cubits:  and the inner house was within the side chambers of the house,<br/>
<br/>
And the inner house was within the side chambers of the house. . .Because these side chambers were in the very walls of the temple all round.  Or, it may also be rendered (more agreeably to the Hebrew) so as to signify that the thickness of the wall for the side chamber within, was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1152">41:10</span>. And between the chambers was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1153">41:11</span>. And the door of the side chambers was turned towards the place of prayer:  one door was toward the north, and another door was toward the south:  and the breadth of the place for prayer, was five cubits round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1154">41:12</span>. And the building that was separate, and turned to the way that looked toward the sea, was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the building, five cubits thick round about:  and ninety cubits long.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1155">41:13</span>. And he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits:  and the separate building, and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits in length.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1156">41:14</span>. And the breadth before the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1157">41:15</span>. And he measured the length of the building over against it, which was separated at the back of it:  and the galleries on both sides a hundred cubits:  and the inner temple, and the porches of the court.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1158">41:16</span>. The thresholds, and the oblique windows, and the galleries round about on three sides, over against the threshold of every one, and floored with wood all round about:  and the ground was up to the windows, and the windows were shut over the doors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1159">41:17</span>. And even to the inner house, and without all the wall round about within and without, by measure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1160">41:18</span>. And there were cherubims and palm trees wrought, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub, and every cherub had two faces.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1161">41:19</span>. The face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side:  set forth through all the house round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1162">41:20</span>. From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate, were cherubims and palm trees wrought in the wall of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1163">41:21</span>. The threshold was foursquare, and the face of the sanctuary sight to sight.<br/>
<br/>
The threshold was foursquare. . .That is, the gate of the temple was foursquare:  and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1164">41:22</span>. The altar of wood was three cubits high:  and the length thereof was two cubits:  and the corners thereof, aid the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood.  And he said to me:  This is the table before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1165">41:23</span>. And there were two doors in the temple, and in the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1166">41:24</span>. And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other:  for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1167">41:25</span>. And there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the temple, and the figures of palm trees, like as were made on the walls: for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the porch without.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1168">41:26</span>. Upon which were the oblique windows, and the representation of palm trees on this side, and on that side in the sides of the porch, according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1172">42:2</span>. In the face of the north door was the length of hundred cubits, and the breadth of fifty cubits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1173">42:3</span>. Over against the twenty cubits of the inner court, and over against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone, where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1174">42:4</span>. And before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad, looking to the inner parts of a way of one cubit.  And their doors were toward the north.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1175">42:5</span>. Where were the store chambers lower above:  because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from he lower parts, and from the midst of the building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1176">42:6</span>. For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts:  therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1177">42:7</span>. And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1178">42:8</span>. For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits:  and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1179">42:9</span>. And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1180">42:10</span>. In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1181">42:11</span>. And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north:  they were as long as they, and as broad as they:  and all the going in to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1182">42:12</span>. According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south:  there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1183">42:13</span>. And he said to me:  The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building:  they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies:  there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass:  for it is a holy place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1184">42:14</span>. And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court:  but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy:  and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people.<br/>

The glory of God returns to the new temple.  The Israelites shall no more profane God's name by idolatry:  the prophet is commanded to shew them the dimensions, and form of the temple, and of the altar, with the sacrifices to be offered thereon.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1193">43:1</span>. And he brought me to the gate that looked towards the east.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1194">43:2</span>. And behold the glory of the God of Israel came in by the way of the east:  and his voice was like the noise of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1195">43:3</span>. And I saw the vision according to the appearance which I had seen when he came to destroy the city:  and the appearance was according to the vision which I had seen by the river Chobar:  and I fell upon my face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1196">43:4</span>. And the majesty of the Lord went into the temple by the way of the gate that looked to the east.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1198">43:6</span>. And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and the man that stood by me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1199">43:7</span>. Said to me:  Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever:  and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their kings by their fornications, and by the carcasses of their kings, and by the high places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1200">43:8</span>. They who have set their threshold by my threshold, and their posts by my posts:  and there was but a wall between me, and them:  and they profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed: for which reason I consumed them in my wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1201">43:9</span>. Now therefore let them put away their fornications, and the carcasses of their kings far from me:  and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1202">43:10</span>. But thou, son of man, shew to the house of Israel the temple, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the building:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1203">43:11</span>. And be ashamed of all that they have done.  Shew them the form of the house, and of the fashion thereof, the goings out and the comings in, and the whole plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and all its order, and all its laws, and thou shalt write it in their sight:  that they may keep the whole form thereof, and its ordinances, and do them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1204">43:12</span>. This is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain:  All its border round about; most holy:  this then is the law of the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1205">43:13</span>. And these are the measures of the altar by the truest cubit, which is a cubit and a handbreadth:  the bottom thereof was a cubit, and the breadth a cubit:  and the border thereof unto its edge, and round about, one handbreadth:  and this was the trench of the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1206">43:14</span>. And from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits, and the breadth of one cubit:  and from the lesser brim to the greater brim four cubits, and the breadth of one cubit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1207">43:15</span>. And the Ariel itself was four cubits:  and from the Ariel upward were four horns.<br/>
<br/>
The Ariel. . .That is, the altar itself, or rather the highest part of it, upon which the burnt offerings were laid.  In the Hebrew it is Harel, that is, the mountain of God:  but in the following verse Haariel, that is, the lion of God; a figure, from its consuming, and as it were devouring the sacrifices, as a lion devours its prey.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1210">43:18</span>. And he said to me:  Son of man, thus saith the Lord God:  These are the ceremonies of the altar, in what day soever it shall be made: that holocausts may be offered upon it, and blood poured out.<br/>

And he brought me again to the gate of the house, and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the east:  for the forefront of the house looked toward the east:  but the waters came down to the right side of the temple to the south part of the altar.<br/>
<br/>
Waters. . .These waters are not to be understood literally (for there were none such that flowed from the temple); but mystically, of the baptism of Christ, and of his doctrine and his grace:  the trees that grow on the banks are Christian virtues:  the fishes are Christians, that spiritually live in and by these holy waters, the fishermen are the apostles, and apostolic preachers:  the fenny places, where there is no health, are such as by being out of the church are separated from these waters of life.<br/>
