<p>THE FIRST BOOK OF ESDRAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book taketh its name from the writer:  who was a holy priest, and doctor of the law.  He is called by the Hebrews, Ezra.<br/>
<br/>
<b>1 Esdras Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Cyrus king of Persia releaseth God's people from their captivity, with license to return and build the temple in Jerusalem:  and restoreth the holy vessels which Nabuchodonosor had taken from thence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians:  and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and in writing also, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians:  The Lord the God of heaven hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Who is there among you of all his people?  His God be with him.  Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel:  he is the God that is in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And king Cyrus brought forth vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of his god.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And this is the number of them:  thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten:  other vessels a thousand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred: all these Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>1 Esdras Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-86"/>
</b><br/>
An altar is built for sacrifice, the feast of tabernacles is solemnly celebrated, and the foundations of the temple are laid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">3:1</span>. And now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities:  and the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">3:2</span>. And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and his brethren the priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel that they might offer holocausts upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.<br/>
<br/>
Josue. . .or Jesus (Jeshua) the son of Josedec; he was the high priest, at that time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">3:3</span>. And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of the lands round about put them in fear, and they offered upon it a holocaust to the Lord morning and evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">3:4</span>. And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the holocaust every day orderly according to the commandment, the duty of the day in its day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">3:5</span>. And afterwards the continual holocaust, both on the new moons, and on all the solemnities of the Lord, that were consecrated, and on all in which a freewill offering was made to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">3:6</span>. From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer holocausts to the Lord:  but the temple of God was not yet founded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">3:7</span>. And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons:  and meat and drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Libanus to the sea of Joppe, according to the orders which Cyrus king of the Persians had given them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">3:8</span>. And in the second year of their coming to the temple of God in Jerusalem, the second month, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the priests, and the Levites, and all that were come from the captivity to Jerusalem began, and they appointed Levites from twenty years old and upward, to hasten forward the work of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">3:9</span>. Then Josue and his sons and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons, and the children of Juda, as one man, stood to hasten them that did the work in the temple of God:  the sons of Henadad, and their sons, and their brethren the Levites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">3:10</span>. And when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the Lord, the priests stood in their ornaments with trumpets:  and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise God by the hands of David king of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">3:11</span>. And they sung together hymns, and praise to the Lord:  because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel.  And all the people shouted with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">3:12</span>. But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers and the ancients that had seen the former temple; when they had the foundation of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud voice:  and many shouting for joy, lifted up their voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">3:13</span>. So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people:  for one with another the people shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off.</p>

</b><br/>
The Samaritans by their letter to the king hinder the building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:1</span>. Now the enemies of Juda and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to the Lord the God of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:2</span>. And they came to Zorobabel, and the chief of the fathers, and said to them:  Let us build with you, for we seek your God as ye do:  behold we have sacrificed to him, since the days of Asor Haddan king of Assyria, who brought us hither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">4:3</span>. But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said to them:  You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus king of the Persians hath commanded us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">4:4</span>. Then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of Juda, and troubled them in building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">4:5</span>. And they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their design all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">4:6</span>. And in the reign of Assuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
Assuerus. . .Otherwise called Cambyses the son and successor of Cyrus. He is also in the following verse named Artaxerxes, a name common to almost all the kings of Persia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">4:7</span>. And in the days of Artaxerxes, Beselam, Mithridates, and Thabeel, and the rest that were in the council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians:  and the letter of accusation was written in Syrian, and was read in the Syrian tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">4:8</span>. Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe wrote a letter from Jerusalem to king Artaxerxes, in this manner:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">4:9</span>. Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe and the rest of their counsellors, the Dinites, and the Apharsathacites, the Therphalites, the Apharsites, the Erchuites, the Babylonians, the Susanechites, the Dievites, and the Elamites,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">4:10</span>. And the rest of the nations, whom the great and glorious Asenaphar brought over:  and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the countries of this side of the river in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">4:11</span>. (This is the copy of the letter, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the king, thy servants, the men that are on this side of the river, send greeting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">4:12</span>. Be it known to the king, that the Jews, who came up from thee to us, are come to Jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, setting up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">4:13</span>. And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues, and this loss will fall upon the kings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">4:14</span>. But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">4:15</span>. That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt find written in the records:  and shalt know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were raised therein of old time:  for which cause also the city was destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:16</span>. We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired, thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">4:17</span>. The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the scribe, and to the rest that were in their council, inhabitants of Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, sending greeting and peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">4:18</span>. The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">4:19</span>. And I commanded:  and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been raised therein.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">4:20</span>. For there have been powerful kings in Jerusalem, who have had dominion over all the country that is beyond the river:  and have received tribute, and toll and revenues.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">4:21</span>. Now therefore hear the sentence:  Hinder those men, that this city be not built, till further orders be given by me.<br/>

By the exhortation of Aggeus, and Zacharias, the people proceed in building the temple.  Which their enemies strive in vain to hinder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:1</span>. Now Aggeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judea and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:2</span>. Then rose up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and began to build the temple of God in Jerusalem, and with them were the prophets of God helping them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:3</span>. And at the same time came to them Thathanai, who was governor beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and their counsellors:  and said thus to them:  Who hath given you counsel to build this house, and to repair the walls thereof?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:4</span>. In answer to which we gave them the names of the men who were the promoters of that building.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:5</span>. But the eye of their God was upon the ancients of the Jews, and they could not hinder them.  And it was agreed that the matter should be referred to Darius, and then they should give satisfaction concerning that accusation.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">5:7</span>. The letter which they sent him, was written thus:  To Darius the king all peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">5:8</span>. Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber is laid in the walls:  and this work is carried on diligently and advanceth in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">5:9</span>. And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus:  Who hath given you authority to build this house, and to repair these walls?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">5:10</span>. We asked also of them their names, that we might give thee notice:  and we have written the names of the men that are the chief among them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">5:11</span>. And they answered us in these words, saying:  We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building a temple that was built these many years ago, and which a great king of Israel built and set up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:12</span>. But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he delivered them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean:  and he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">5:13</span>. But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, king Cyrus set forth a decree, that this house of God should be built.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">5:14</span>. And the vessels also of gold and silver of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor had taken out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, and had brought them to the temple of Babylon, king Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sassabasar, whom also he appointed governor,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">5:15</span>. And said to him:  Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:16</span>. Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not yet finished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">5:17</span>. Now therefore if it seem good to the king, let him search in the king's library, which is in Babylon, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that the house of God in Jerusalem should be built, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">6:2</span>. And there was found in Ecbatana, which is a castle in the province of Media, a book in which this record was written.<br/>

And also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor took out of the temple of Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and carried back to the temple of Jerusalem to their place, which also were placed in the temple of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:6</span>. Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, depart far from them,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:8</span>. I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king's chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered.<br/>
<br/>

And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocausts to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the custom of the priests that are in Jerusalem, be given them day by day, that there be no complaint in any thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:10</span>. And let them offer oblations to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his children.<br/>

And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the children of the priests, and of the children of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and of the Nathinites to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.<br/>

And I proclaimed a fast. . .It is not enough to part from Babylon, that is, figuratively from sin, but we must also do works of penance; and therefore Esdras here proclaimed an extraordinary fast to those that were come from captivity.

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">8:32</span>. And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">8:33</span>. And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, Levites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">8:34</span>. According to the number and weight of everything:  and all the weight was written at that time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">8:35</span>. Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats for sin:  all for a holocaust to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">8:36</span>. And they gave the king's edicts to the lords that were from the king's court, and the governors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the house of God.</p>

<p><b>1 Esdras Chapter 9<br id="bookmark-drb1752-238"/>
</b><br/>
Esdras mourneth for the transgression of the people:  his confession and prayer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">9:1</span>. And after these things were accomplished, the princes came to me, saying:  The people of Israel, and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, and from their abominations, namely, of the Chanaanites, and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, and the Ammonites, and the Moabites, and the Egyptians, and the Amorrhites.<br/>
<br/>
This shows how sinful it is to intermarry with those that the Church forbids us, on account of the danger of perversion and falling off from the true faith.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">9:2</span>. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and they have mingled the holy seed with the people of the lands.  And the hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in this transgression.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">9:3</span>. And when I had heard this word, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked off the hairs of my head and my beard, and I sat down mourning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">9:4</span>. And there were assembled to me all that feared the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that were come from the captivity, and I sat sorrowful, until the evening sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">9:5</span>. And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my affliction, and having rent my mantle and my garment, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the Lord my God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">9:6</span>. And said:  My God I am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to thee:  for our iniquities are multiplied over our heads, and our sins are grown up even unto heaven,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">9:7</span>. From the days of our fathers:  and we ourselves also have sinned grievously unto this day, and for our iniquities we and our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, and to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">9:8</span>. And now as a little, and for a moment has our prayer been made before the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in his holy place, and that our God would enlighten our eyes, and would give us a little life in our bondage.<br/>
<br/>
A pin. . .or nail, here signifies a small settlement or holding; which Esdras begs for, to preserve even a part of the people, who, by their great iniquity had incurred the anger of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">9:9</span>. For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our God hath not forsaken us, but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to give us life, and to set up the house of our God, and to rebuild the desolations thereof, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">9:10</span>. And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?  for we have forsaken thy commandments,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">9:11</span>. Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying:  The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their filth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">9:12</span>. Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, and take not their daughters for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their prosperity for ever:  that you may be strengthened, and may eat the good things of the land, and may have your children your heirs for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">9:13</span>. And after all that is come upon us, for our most wicked deeds, and our great sin, seeing that thou our God hast saved us from our iniquity, and hast given us a deliverance as at this day,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">9:14</span>. That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor join in marriage with the people of these abominations.  Art thou angry with us unto utter destruction, not to leave us a remnant to be saved?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">9:15</span>. O Lord God of Israel, thou art just:  for we remain yet to be saved as at this day.  Behold we are before thee in our sin, for there can be no standing before thee in this matter.</p>

<p><b>1 Esdras Chapter 10<br id="bookmark-drb1752-255"/>
</b><br/>
Order is given for discharging strange women:  the names of the guilty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">10:1</span>. Now when Esdras was thus praying, and beseeching, and weeping, and lying before the temple of God, there was gathered to him of Israel an exceeding great assembly of men and women and children, and the people wept with much lamentation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">10:2</span>. And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to Esdras:  We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:  and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">10:3</span>. Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them that fear the commandment of the Lord our God:  let it be done according to the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">10:4</span>. Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take courage, and do it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">10:5</span>. So Esdras arose, and made the chiefs of the priests and of the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word, and they swore.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">10:6</span>. And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither:  he ate no bread, and drank no water:  for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come out of the captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">10:7</span>. And proclamation was made in Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble together into Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">10:8</span>. And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">10:9</span>. Then all the men of Juda, and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days, in the ninth month, the twentieth day of the month:  and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of the sin, and the rain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">10:10</span>. And Esdras the priest stood up, and said to them:  You have transgressed, and taken strange wives, to add to the sins of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">10:11</span>. And now make confession to the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange wives.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">10:12</span>. And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy word unto us, so be it done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">10:13</span>. But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and we are not able to stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly sinned in this matter,)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">10:14</span>. Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude:  and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned away from us for this sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">10:15</span>. Then Jonathan the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, Levites, helped them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">10:16</span>. And the children of the captivity did so.  And Esdras the priest, and the men heads of the families in the houses of their fathers, and all by their names, went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">10:17</span>. And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">10:18</span>. And there were found among the sons of the priests that had taken strange wives:  Of the sons of Josue the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Godolia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">10:19</span>. And they gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer for their offence a ram of the flock.<br/>
