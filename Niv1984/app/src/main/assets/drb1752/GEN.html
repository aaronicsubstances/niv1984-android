<p>THE BOOK OF GENESIS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This book is so called from its treating of the GENERATION, that is, of the creation and the beginning of the world.  The Hebrews call it
BERESITH, from the Word with which it begins.  It contains not only the history of the Creation of the world; but also an account of its
progress during the space of 2369 years, that is, until the death of JOSEPH.</p>
<p><b>Genesis Chapter 1<br/>
</b>
<br/>
God createth Heaven and Earth, and all things therein, in six days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And God said:  Be light made.  And light was made.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And God said:  Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters:  and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br/>
<br/>
A firmament. . .By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth, and the highest stars.  The lower part of which divideth the
waters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place:  and let the dry land appear.  And it
was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas.  And God saw that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And he said:  let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may
have seed in itself upon the earth.  And it was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having
seed each one according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And the evening and the morning were the third day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And God said:  Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days and years:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth, and it was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And God made two great lights:  a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night:  and the stars.<br/>
<br/>
Two great lights. . .God created on the first day, light, which being moved from east to west, by its rising and setting, made morning and
evening.  But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars.  The moon, though much less than the
stars, is here called a great light, from its giving a far greater light to the earth than any of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness.  And God saw that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. God also said:  let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the
firmament of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and
every winged fowl according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. And he blessed them, saying:  Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea:  and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. And God said:  Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and
creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds.  And it was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.
And God saw that it was good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. And he said:  Let us make man to our image and likeness:  and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air,
and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Let us make man to our image. . .This image of God in man, is not in the body, but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance, endued with
understanding and free will.  God speaketh here in the plural number, to insinuate the plurality of persons in the Deity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. And God created man to his own image:  to the image of God he created him:  male and female he created them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. And God blessed them, saying:  Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the
fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Increase and multiply. . .This is not a precept, as some Protestant controvertists would have it, but a blessing, rendering them fruitful;
for God had said the same words to the fishes, and birds, (ver. 22) who were incapable of receiving a precept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. And God said:  Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own
kind, to be your meat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they
may have to feed upon.  And it was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good.  And the evening and morning were the sixth day.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-33-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Genesis Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-34"/>
</b><br/>
God resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it.  The earthly paradise, in which God placeth man.  He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of
knowledge.  And formeth a woman of his rib.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:1</span>. So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:2</span>. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made:  and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.<br/>
<br/>
He rested, etc. . .That is, he ceased to make or create any new kinds of things.  Though, as our Lord tells us, John 5.17, "He still
worketh", viz., by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:3</span>. And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:  because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:4</span>. These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the
earth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:5</span>. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew:  for the Lord God had not
rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:6</span>. But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:7</span>. And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth:  and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living
soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:8</span>. And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning:  wherein he placed man whom he had formed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:9</span>. And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of:  the tree of life also in the
midst of paradise:  and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br/>
<br/>
The tree of life. . .So called because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant
state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all. The tree of knowledge. . .To which the deceitful serpent falsely
attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge, beyond that which God was pleased to give.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:10</span>. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:11</span>. The name of the one is Phison:  that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:12</span>. And the gold of that land is very good:  there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:13</span>. And the name of the second river is Gehon:  the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:14</span>. And the name of the third river is Tigris:  the same passeth along by the Assyrians.  And the fourth river is Euphrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:15</span>. And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:16</span>. And he commanded him, saying:  Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:17</span>. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.  For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the
death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:18</span>. And the Lord God said:  It is not good for man to be alone:  let us make him a help like unto himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:19</span>. And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see
what he would call them:  for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:20</span>. And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field:  but for Adam there was not
found a helper like himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:21</span>. Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam:  and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:22</span>. And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman:  and brought her to Adam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:23</span>. And Adam said:  This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:24</span>. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife:  and they shall be two in one flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">2:25</span>. And they were both naked:  to wit, Adam and his wife:  and were not ashamed.</p>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-61"/>
</b><br/>
The serpent's craft.  The fall of our first parents.  Their punishment. The promise of a Redeemer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:1</span>. Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made.  And he said to the woman:  Why hath
God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:2</span>. And the woman answered him, saying:  Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:3</span>. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not
touch it, lest perhaps we die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:4</span>. And the serpent said to the woman:  No, you shall not die the death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:5</span>. For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:  and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and
evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:6</span>. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold:  and she took of the fruit thereof, and
did eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:7</span>. And the eyes of them both were opened:  and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made
themselves aprons.<br/>
<br/>
And the eyes, etc. . .Not that they were blind before, (for the woman saw that the tree was fair to the eyes, ver. 6.) nor yet that their
eyes were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and
innocence, and incurred the dreadful evil of sin.  From whence followed a shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because
being now stript of original grace, they quickly began to be subject to the shameful rebellions of the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:8</span>. And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of
the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:9</span>. And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him:  Where art thou?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:10</span>. And he said:  I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:11</span>. And he said to him:  And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
shouldst not eat?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:12</span>. And Adam said:  The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:13</span>. And the Lord God said to the woman:  Why hast thou done this?  And she answered:  The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:14</span>. And the Lord God said to the serpent:  Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth:  upon
thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:15</span>. I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed:  she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her
heel.<br/>
<br/>
She shall crush. . .Ipsa, the woman; so divers of the fathers read this place, conformably to the Latin:  others read it ipsum, viz., the seed.
The sense is the same:  for it is by her seed, Jesus Christ, that the woman crushes the serpent's head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:16</span>. To the woman also he said:  I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions:  in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt
be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:17</span>. And to Adam he said:  Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that
thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:  with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:18</span>. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">3:19</span>. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken:  for dust thou art, and into
dust thou shalt return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:20</span>. And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:  because she was the mother of all the living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">3:21</span>. And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">3:22</span>. And he said:  Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil:  now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of
the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.<br/>
<br/>
Behold Adam, etc. . .This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his pride, in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">3:23</span>. And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">3:24</span>. And he cast out Adam:  and placed before the paradise of pleasure
Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 4<br id="bookmark-drb1752-87"/>
</b><br/>
The history of Cain and Abel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:1</span>. And Adam knew Eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying:  I have gotten a man through God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:2</span>. And again she brought forth his brother Abel.  And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:3</span>. And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:4</span>. Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat:  and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Had respect. . .That is, shewed his acceptance of his sacrifice (as coming from a heart full of devotion):  and that, as we may suppose, by
some visible token, such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">4:5</span>. But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect:  and Cain was exceeding angry, and his countenance fell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">4:6</span>. And the Lord said to him:  Why art thou angry?  and why is thy countenance fallen?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">4:7</span>. If thou do well, shalt thou not receive?  but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door?  but the lust thereof shall be under
thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">4:8</span>. And Cain said to Abel his brother:  Let us go forth abroad.  And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and
slew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">4:9</span>. And the Lord said to Cain:  Where is thy brother Abel?  And he answered:  I know not:  am I my brother's keeper?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">4:10</span>. And he said to him:  What hast thou done?  the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">4:11</span>. Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">4:12</span>. When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit:  a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">4:13</span>. And Cain said to the Lord:  My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">4:14</span>. Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a
fugitive on the earth:  every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me.<br/>
<br/>
Every one that findeth me shall kill me. . .His guilty conscience made him fear his own brothers and nephews; of whom, by this time, there
might be a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years; as may be gathered from Gen. 5.3, compared with chap. 4.25,
though in the compendious account given in the scriptures, only Cain and Abel are mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:15</span>. And the Lord said to him:  No, it shall not so be:  but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold.  And the Lord set a mark
upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.<br/>
<br/>
Set a mark, etc. . .The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy writ supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a
horror and consternation in his countenance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:16</span>. And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the east side of Eden.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">4:17</span>. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch:  and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of
his son Henoch.<br/>
<br/>
His wife. . .She was a daughter of Adam, and Cain's own sister; God dispensing with such marriages in the beginning of the world, as
mankind could not otherwise be propagated.  He built a city, viz. . .In process of time, when his race was multiplied, so as to be numerous
enough to people it.  For in the many hundred years he lived, his race might be multiplied even to millions.<br/>
<br/>

wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.<br/>
<br/>
I have slain a man, etc. . .It is the tradition of the Hebrews, that Lamech in hunting slew Cain, mistaking him for a wild beast; and that
having discovered what he had done, he beat so unmercifully the youth, by whom he was led into that mistake, that he died of the blows.<br/>

worship and invocation of God.</p>

Man's sin is the cause of the deluge.  Noe is commanded to build the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">6:1</span>. And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:2</span>. The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all which they chose.<br/>
<br/>
The sons of God. . .The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called sons of God from their religion and piety:  whereas the ungodly race of
Cain, who by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth, are called the children of men.  The unhappy consequence of the former
marrying with the latter, ought to be a warning to Christians to be very circumspect in their marriages; and not to suffer themselves to be
determined in their choice by their carnal passion, to the prejudice of virtue or religion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">6:3</span>. And God said:  My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
His days shall be, etc. . .The meaning is, that man's days, which before the flood were usually 900 years, should now be reduced to 120 years.
Or rather, that God would allow men this term of 120 years, for their repentance and conversion, before he would send the deluge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:4</span>. Now giants were upon the earth in those days.  For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth
children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.<br/>
<br/>
Giants. . .It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a gigantic stature in comparison with what men now are.  But these here
spoken of are called giants, as being not only tall in stature, but violent and savage in their dispositions, and mere monsters of cruelty
and lust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:5</span>. And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all
times,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:6</span>. It repented him that he had made man on the earth.  And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,<br/>
<br/>
It repented him, etc. . .God, who is unchangeable, is not capable of repentance, grief, or any other passion.  But these expressions are used
to declare the enormity of the sins of men, which was so provoking as to determine their Creator to destroy these his creatures, whom before
he had so much favoured.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:7</span>. He said:  I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the
fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">6:12</span>. And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth),<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:13</span>. He said to Noe:  The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the
earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:14</span>. Make thee an ark of timber planks:  thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.<br/>

thirty cubits.<br/>
<br/>
Three hundred cubits, etc. . .The ark, according to the dimensions here set down, contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits;
which was more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures, with all necessary provisions:  even supposing the cubits
here spoken of to have been only a foot and a half each, which was the least kind of cubits.<br/>

Did not return. . .The raven did not return into the ark; but (as it may be gathered from the Hebrew) went to and fro; sometimes going to the
mountains, where it found carcasses to feed on:  and other times returning, to rest upon the top of the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">8:8</span>. He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">8:9</span>. But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark:  for the waters were upon the whole earth:  and he put
forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">8:10</span>. And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-209">8:11</span>. And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth.  Noe therefore understood that

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 9<br id="bookmark-drb1752-222"/>
</b><br/>
God blesseth Noe:  forbiddeth blood, and promiseth never more to destroy the world by water.  The blessing of Sem and Japheth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">9:1</span>. And God blessed Noe and his sons.  And he said to them:  Increase, and multiply, and fill the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">9:2</span>. And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the
earth:  all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">9:3</span>. And every thing that moveth, and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">9:4</span>. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">9:5</span>. For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his
brother, will I require the life of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">9:6</span>. Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed:  for man was made to the image of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">9:7</span>. But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth and fill it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">9:8</span>. Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">9:9</span>. Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">9:10</span>. And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds, as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of
the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">9:11</span>. I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from
henceforth a flood to waste the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">9:12</span>. And God said:  This is the sign of the covenant which I give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for
perpetual generations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">9:13</span>. I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me and between the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">9:14</span>. And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">9:15</span>. And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh:  and there shall no more be waters of a flood
to destroy all flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">9:16</span>. And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every
living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">9:17</span>. And God said to Noe:  This shall be the sign of the covenant, which I have established, between me and all flesh upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">9:18</span>. And the sons of Noe, who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth:  and Cham is the father of Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">9:19</span>. These three are the sons of Noe:  and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">9:20</span>. And Noe a husbandman began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">9:21</span>. And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.<br/>
<br/>
Drunk. . .Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin, in being overcome by wine:  because he knew not the strength of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">9:22</span>. Which when Cham the father of Chanaan had seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren
without.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">9:23</span>. But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father:  and their faces were
turned away, and they saw not their father's nakedness.<br/>
<br/>
Covered the nakedness. . .Thus, as St. Gregory takes notice L. 35; Moral. c. 22, we ought to cover the nakedness, that is, the sins, of
our spiritual parents and superiors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">9:24</span>. And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">9:25</span>. He said:  Cursed be Chanaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
Cursed be Chanaan. . .The curses, as well as the blessings, of the patriarchs, were prophetical:  And this in particular is here recorded
by Moses, for the children of Israel, who were to possess the land of Chanaan.  But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's faults?  The
Hebrews answer, that he being then a boy, was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined
with him in laughing at it:  which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham, this prophetical curse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">9:26</span>. And he said:  Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">9:27</span>. May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">9:28</span>. And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">9:29</span>. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">10:5</span>. By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands, every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.<br/>

The islands. . .So the Hebrews called all the remote countries, to which they went by ships from Judea, to Greece, Italy, Spain, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">10:6</span>. And the Sons of Cham:  Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">10:7</span>. And the sons of Chus:  Saba, and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and
Sabatacha.  The sons of Regma:  Saba, and Dadan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">10:8</span>. Now Chus begot Nemrod:  he began to be mighty on the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">10:9</span>. And he was a stout hunter before the Lord.  Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
A stout hunter. . .Not of beasts but of men:  whom by violence and tyranny he brought under his dominion.  And such he was, not only in the
opinion of men, but before the Lord, that is, in his sight who cannot be deceived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">10:10</span>. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">10:11</span>. Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">10:19</span>. And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and

Jectan.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-290">11:3</span>. And each one said to his neighbour:  Come let us make brick, and bake them with fire.  And they had brick instead of stones, and slime
instead of mortar:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-291">11:4</span>. And they said:  Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-292">11:5</span>. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam were building.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-327">12:6</span>. Abram passed through the country unto the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale:  now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.<br/>

<br/>
My sister. . .This was no lie; because she was his niece, being daughter to his brother Aran, and therefore, in the style of the Hebrews, she
might truly be called his sister, as Lot is called Abram's brother, Gen. 14.14.  See Gen. 20.12.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">12:14</span>. And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.<br/>

camels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">12:17</span>. But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.<br/>
<br/>

Abram and Lot part from each other.  God's promise to Abram.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">13:1</span>. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into the south.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">13:2</span>. And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-346">13:3</span>. And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-347">13:4</span>. In the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he called upon the name of the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">13:6</span>. Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together:  for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-350">13:7</span>. Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot.  And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-351">13:8</span>. Abram therefore said to Lot:  Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">13:9</span>. Behold the whole land is before thee:  depart from me, I pray thee:  if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right:  if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">13:10</span>. And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">13:11</span>. And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east:  and they were separated one brother from the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">13:12</span>. Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan:  and Lot abode in the towns, that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">13:13</span>. And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord beyond measure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">13:14</span>. And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">13:15</span>. All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">14:2</span>. Made war against Bara, king of Sodom, and against Bersa, king of Gomorrha, and against Sennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber, king of Seboim, and against the king of Bala, which is Segor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">14:3</span>. All these came together into the woodland vale, which now is the salt sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">14:4</span>. For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they revolted from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">14:5</span>. And in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and the kings that were with him:  and they smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim, and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save of Cariathaim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">14:6</span>. And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir, even to the plains of Pharan, which is in the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">14:7</span>. And they returned, and came to the fountain of Misphat, the same is Cades:  and they smote all the country of the Amalecites, and the Amorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">14:8</span>. And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor, went out:  and they set themselves against them in battle array, in the woodland vale:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">14:9</span>. To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus:  four kings against five.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">14:10</span>. Now the woodland vale had many pits of slime.  And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs, and were overthrown there:  and they that remained, fled to the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Of slime.  Bituminis. . .This was a kind of pitch, which served for mortar in the building of Babel, Gen. 11.3, and was used by Noe in pitching the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">14:11</span>. And they took all the substance of the Sodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their victuals, and went their way:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">14:15</span>. And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the night, and defeated them:  and pursued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">14:16</span>. And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his brother, with his substance, the women also, and the people.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">15:2</span>. And Abram said:  Lord God, what wilt thou give me?  I shall go without children:  and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">16:1</span>. Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children:  but having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">16:2</span>. She said to her husband:  Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing:  go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least.  And when he agreed to her request,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">16:3</span>. She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.<br/>
<br/>
To wife. . .Plurality of wives, though contrary to the primitive institution of marriage, Gen. 2.24, was by divine dispensation allowed to the patriarchs:  which allowance seems to have continued during the time of the law of Moses.  But Christ our Lord reduced marriage to its primitive institution.  Matt. 19.<br/>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 18<br id="bookmark-drb1752-459"/>

Angels are entertained by Abraham.  They foretell the birth of Isaac. Abraham's prayer for the men of Sodom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">18:1</span>. And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">18:2</span>. And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three men standing near to him:  and as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and adored down to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">18:3</span>. And he said:  Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">18:4</span>. But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye your feet, and rest ye under the tree.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">18:5</span>. And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall pass on:  for therefore are you come aside to your servant.  And they said:  Do as thou hast spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">18:6</span>. Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara, and said to her:  Make haste, temper together three measures of flour, and make cakes upon the hearth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">18:7</span>. And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence a calf, very tender and very good, and gave it to a young man, who made haste and boiled it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">18:8</span>. He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he had boiled, and set before them:  but he stood by them under the tree.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">18:9</span>. And when they had eaten, they said to him:  Where is Sara thy wife?  He answered:  Lo she is in the tent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">18:10</span>. And he said to him:  I will return and come to thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara, thy wife, shall have a son.  Which when Sara heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">18:11</span>. Now they were both old, and far advanced in years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of women.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">18:12</span>. And she laughed secretly, saying:  After I am grown old, and my lord is an old man, shall I give myself to pleasure?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">18:13</span>. And the Lord said to Abraham:  Why did Sara laugh, saying:  Shall I, who am an old woman, bear a child indeed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">18:14</span>. Is there any thing hard to God?  According to appointment I will return to thee at this same time, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">18:15</span>. Sara denied, saying:  I did not laugh:  for she was afraid.  But the Lord said:  Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">18:16</span>. And when the men rose up from thence, they turned their eyes towards Sodom:  and Abraham walked with them, bringing them on the way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">18:17</span>. And the Lord said:  Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-477">18:18</span>. Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">18:19</span>. For I know that he will command his children, and his household after him, to keep the way of the Lord, and do judgment and justice: that for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-479">18:20</span>. And the Lord said:  The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly grievous.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-480">18:21</span>. I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me; or whether it be not so, that I may know.<br/>
<br/>
I will go down, etc. . .The Lord here accommodates his discourse to the way of speaking and acting amongst men; for he knoweth all things, and needeth not to go anywhere for information.  Note here, that two of the three angels went away immediately for Sodom; whilst the third, who represented the Lord, remained with Abraham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">18:22</span>. And they turned themselves from thence, and went their way to Sodom:  but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">18:23</span>. And drawing nigh, he said:  Wilt thou destroy the just with the wicked?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">18:24</span>. If there be fifty just men in the city, shall they perish withal?  and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just, if they be therein?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">18:25</span>. Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the just with the wicked, and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is not beseeming thee:  thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not make this judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">18:26</span>. And the Lord said to him:  If I find in Sodom fifty just within the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">18:27</span>. And Abraham answered, and said:  Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">18:28</span>. What if there be five less than fifty just persons?  wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city:  And he said:  I will not destroy it, if I find five and forty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">18:29</span>. And again he said to him:  But if forty be found there, what wilt thou do?  He said:  I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-489">18:30</span>. Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I speak:  What if thirty shall be found there?  He answered:  I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-490">18:31</span>. Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord: What if twenty be found there?  He said:  I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-491">18:32</span>. I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I speak yet once more:  What if ten shall be found there?  And he said:  I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">18:33</span>. And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.<br/>

Lot, entertaining Angels in his house, is delivered from Sodom, which is destroyed:  his wife for looking back is turned into a statue of salt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">19:1</span>. And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the city.  And seeing them, he rose up and went to meet them:  and worshipped prostrate to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">19:2</span>. And said:  I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there:  wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go on your way.  And they said:  No, but we will abide in the street.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">19:3</span>. He pressed them very much to turn in unto him:  and when they were come into his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">19:4</span>. But before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house, both young and old, all the people together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">19:5</span>. And they called Lot, and said to him:  Where are the men that came in to thee at night?  bring them out hither, that we may know them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">19:6</span>. Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">19:7</span>. Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">19:8</span>. I have two daughters who, as yet, have not known man; I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">19:9</span>. But they said:  Get thee back thither.  And again:  Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge?  therefore we will afflict thee more than them.  And they pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">19:10</span>. And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">19:11</span>. And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">19:12</span>. And they said to Lot:  Hast thou here any of thine?  son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">19:13</span>. For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">19:14</span>. So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters, and said:  Arise:  get you out of this place, because the Lord will destroy this city.  And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">19:15</span>. And when it was morning, the angels pressed him, saying:  Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters that thou hast:  lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">19:16</span>. And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">19:17</span>. And they brought him forth, and set him without the city:  and there they spoke to him, saying:  Save thy life:  look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about:  but save thy self in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">19:18</span>. And Lot said to them:  I beseech thee, my Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">19:19</span>. Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil seize me, and I die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">19:20</span>. There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it:  is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">19:21</span>. And he said to him:  Behold also in this, I have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">19:22</span>. Make haste, and be saved there:  because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither.  Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.<br/>
<br/>
Segor. . .That is, a little one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">19:23</span>. The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">19:24</span>. And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">19:25</span>. And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">19:26</span>. And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of salt.<br/>
<br/>
And his wife. . .As a standing memorial to the servants of God to proceed in virtue, and not to look back to vice or its allurements.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-521">19:27</span>. And Abraham got up early in the morning, and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-522">19:28</span>. He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that country:  and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">19:29</span>. Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-524">19:30</span>. And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-525">19:31</span>. And the elder said to the younger:  Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">19:32</span>. Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">19:33</span>. And they made their father drink wine that night:  and the elder went in, and lay with her father:  but he perceived not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">19:34</span>. And the next day the elder said to the younger:  Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">19:35</span>. They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him:  and neither then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">19:36</span>. So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">19:37</span>. And the elder bore a son, and she called his name Moab:  he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-532">19:38</span>. The younger also bore a son, and she called his name Ammon; that is, the son of my people:  he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">20:3</span>. And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him:  Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken:  for she hath a husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">20:4</span>. Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said:  Lord, wilt thou slay a nation that is ignorant and just?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">20:6</span>. And God said to him:  And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart:  and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">20:7</span>. Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet:  and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live:  but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">20:9</span>. And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him:  What hast thou done to us?  what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?  thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-544">20:10</span>. And again he expostulated with him, and said:  What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">20:12</span>. Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">21:13</span>. But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-571">21:17</span>. And God heard the voice of the boy:  and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying:  What art thou doing, Agar?  fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">21:18</span>. Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-573">21:19</span>. And God opened her eyes:  and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-574">21:20</span>. And God was with him:  and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-575">21:21</span>. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-576">21:22</span>. At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army, said to Abraham:  God is with thee in all that thou dost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-577">21:23</span>. Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock:  but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">21:24</span>. And Abraham said:  I will swear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">21:25</span>. And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">21:26</span>. And Abimelech answered:  I knew not who did this thing:  and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">21:27</span>. Then Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">21:28</span>. And Abraham set apart seven ewelambs of the flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">21:29</span>. And Abimelech said to him:  What mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">21:30</span>. But he said:  Thou shalt take seven ewelambs at my hand:  that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">21:31</span>. Therefore that place was called Bersabee; because there both of them did swear.<br/>
<br/>
Bersabee. . .That is, the well of oath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">21:32</span>. And they made a league for the well of oath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">21:33</span>. And Abimelech and Phicol, the general of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Palestines.  But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-588">21:34</span>. And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.</p>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 22<br id="bookmark-drb1752-590"/>
</b><br/>
The faith and obedience of Abraham is proved in his readiness to sacrifice his son Isaac.  He is stayed from the act by an angel.  Former promises are renewed to him.  His brother Nachor's issue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-591">22:1</span>. After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham.  And he answered:  Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
God tempted, etc. . .God tempteth no man to evil, James 1.13; but by trial and experiment maketh known to the world, and to ourselves, what we are, as here by this trial the singular faith and obedience of Abraham was made manifest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-592">22:2</span>. He said to him:  Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-593">22:3</span>. So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass, and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son:  and when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-594">22:4</span>. And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-595">22:5</span>. And he said to his young men:  Stay you here with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-596">22:6</span>. And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword.  And as they two went on together,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-597">22:7</span>. Isaac said to his father:  My father.  And he answered:  What wilt thou, son?  Behold, saith he, fire and wood:  where is the victim for the holocaust?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-598">22:8</span>. And Abraham said:  God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son.  So they went on together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-599">22:9</span>. And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-600">22:10</span>. And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-601">22:11</span>. And behold, an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying:  Abraham, Abraham.  And he answered:  Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-602">22:12</span>. And he said to him:  Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him:  now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-603">22:13</span>. Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-604">22:14</span>. And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth.  Whereupon, even to this day, it is said:  In the mountain the Lord will see.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-605">22:15</span>. And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-606">22:16</span>. By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord:  because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-607">22:17</span>. I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-608">22:18</span>. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-610">22:20</span>. After these things, it was told Abraham, that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.<br/>

Sara's death and burial in the field bought of Ephron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-617">23:1</span>. And Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">23:2</span>. And she died in the city of Arbee which is Hebron, in the land of Chanaan:  and Abraham came to mourn and weep for her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">23:3</span>. And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies, he spoke to the children of Heth, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-620">23:4</span>. I am a stranger and sojourner among you:  give me the right of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">23:5</span>. The children of Heth answered, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-622">23:6</span>. My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God among us:  bury thy dead in our principal sepulchres:  and no man shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his sepulchre.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">23:7</span>. Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, to wit, the children of Heth:<br/>
<br/>
Bowed down to the people. . .Adoravit, literally adored.  But this word here, as well as in many other places in the Latin scriptures, is used to signify only an inferior honour and reverence paid to men, expressed by a bowing down of the body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-624">23:8</span>. And said to them:  If it please your soul that I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron the son of Seor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-625">23:9</span>. That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in the end of his field:  For as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you, for a possession of a burying place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-626">23:10</span>. Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth.  And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">23:11</span>. Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken to what I say:  The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the presence of the children of my people, bury thy dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-628">23:12</span>. Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">23:13</span>. And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people:  I beseech thee to hear me:  I will give money for the field; take it, and so will I bury my dead in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">23:14</span>. And Ephron answered:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">23:15</span>. My lord, hear me.  The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver:  this is the price between me and thee:  but what is this?  bury thy dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">23:16</span>. And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred sicles of silver, of common current money.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">23:17</span>. And the field that before was Ephron's, wherein was the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees thereof, in all its limits round about,<br/>
<br/>

Abraham's servant, sent by him into Mesopotamia, bringeth from thence Rebecca, who is married to Isaac.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-639">24:1</span>. Now Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed him in all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">24:2</span>. And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was ruler over all he had:  Put thy hand under my thigh,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-641">24:3</span>. That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the daughters of the Chanaanites, among whom I dwell:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">24:4</span>. But that thou go to my own country and kindred, and take a wife from thence for my son Isaac.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">24:5</span>. The servant answered:  If the woman will not come with me into this land, must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou camest out?<br/>

The Lord God of heaven, who took me out of my father's house, and out of my native country, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:  To thy seed will I give this land:  he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.<br/>
<br/>
He will send his angel before thee. . .This shows that the Hebrews believed that God gave them guardian angels for their protection.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">24:8</span>. But if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by the oath:  only bring not my son back thither again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">24:9</span>. The servant, therefore, put his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his lord, and swore to him upon his word.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">24:10</span>. And he took ten camels of his master's herd, and departed, carrying something of all his goods with him, and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-649">24:11</span>. And when he had made the camels lie down without the town, near a well of water, in the evening, at the time when women are wont to come out to draw water, he said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-650">24:12</span>. O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, meet me today, I beseech thee, and shew kindness to my master, Abraham.<br/>

Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say:  Let down thy pitcher that I may drink:  and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:  let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac:  and by this, I shall understand that thou hast shewn kindness to my master.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-654">24:16</span>. An exceeding comely maid, and a most beautiful virgin, and not known to man:  and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and was coming back.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-656">24:18</span>. And she answered:  Drink, my lord.  And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">24:19</span>. And when he had drunk, she said:  I will draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">24:20</span>. And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to the well to draw water; and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">24:21</span>. But he musing, beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-660">24:22</span>. And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out golden earrings, weighing two sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">24:26</span>. The man bowed himself down, and adored the Lord,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">24:28</span>. Then the maid ran, and told in her mother's house all that she had heard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-667">24:29</span>. And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban, who went out in haste to the man, to the well.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-670">24:32</span>. And he brought him into his lodging; and he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were come with him.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">24:41</span>. But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee one.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">24:43</span>. Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say:  Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">24:44</span>. And shall say to me:  Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:  let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for my master's son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">24:45</span>. And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder:  and she went down to the well and drew water.  And I said to her:  Give me a little to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">24:46</span>. And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me:  Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink.  I drank, and she watered the camels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">24:47</span>. And I asked her, and said:  Whose daughter art thou?  And she answered:  I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him.  So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">24:48</span>. And falling down, I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">24:49</span>. Wherefore, if you do according to mercy and truth with my master, tell me:  but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">24:50</span>. And Laban and Bathuel answered:  The word hath proceeded from the Lord:  we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">24:51</span>. Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">24:52</span>. Which when Abraham's servant heard, falling down to the ground, he adored the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">24:53</span>. And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca, for a present.  He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">24:54</span>. And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there.  And in the morning, the servant arose, and said:  Let me depart, that I may go to my master.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">24:55</span>. And her brother and mother answered:  Let the maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">24:56</span>. Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">24:57</span>. And they said:  Let us call the maid, and ask her will.<br/>
<br/>
Let us call the maid, and ask her will. . .Not as to her marriage, as she had already consented, but of her quitting her parents and going to her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">24:58</span>. And they called her, and when she was come, they asked:  Wilt thou go with this man?  She said:  I will go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">24:59</span>. So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his company.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">24:60</span>. Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying:  Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">24:61</span>. So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man:  who with speed returned to his master.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">24:62</span>. At the same time, Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing:  for he dwelt in the south country:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">24:63</span>. And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent:  and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">24:64</span>. Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">24:65</span>. And said to the servant:  Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field?  And he said to her:  That man is my master.  But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">24:66</span>. And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">24:67</span>. Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her to wife:  and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother's death.<br/>

Abraham's children by Cetura; his death and that of Ismael.  Isaac hath Esau and Jacob twins.  Esau selleth his first birthright to Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-708">25:1</span>. And Abraham married another wife named Cetura:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-709">25:2</span>. Who bore him Zamram, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-710">25:3</span>. Jecsan also begot Saba, and Dadan.  The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-711">25:4</span>. But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa:  all these were the children of Cetura.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-712">25:5</span>. And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">25:6</span>. And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.<br/>
<br/>
Concubines. . .Agar and Cetura are here called concubines, (though they were lawful wives, and in other places are so called,) because they were of an inferior degree, and such in scripture are usually called concubines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-714">25:7</span>. And the days of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-715">25:8</span>. And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days:  and was gathered to his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-716">25:9</span>. And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">25:10</span>. Which he had bought of the children of Heth:  there was he buried, and Sara his wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">25:11</span>. And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">25:12</span>. These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's servant, bore unto him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-720">25:13</span>. And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations.  The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-721">25:14</span>. And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-722">25:15</span>. Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">25:16</span>. These are the sons of Ismael:  and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">25:17</span>. And the years of Ismael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">25:18</span>. And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians.  He died in the presence of all his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">25:19</span>. These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">25:20</span>. Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-728">25:21</span>. And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren:  and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">25:22</span>. But the children struggled in her womb, and she said:  If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive?  And she went to consult the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">25:23</span>. And he answering, said:  Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-731">25:24</span>. And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">25:25</span>. He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin:  and his name was called Esau.  Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother's foot in his hand:  and therefore he was called Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">25:26</span>. Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">25:27</span>. And when they were grown up, Esau became a skilful hunter, and a husbandman:  but Jacob, a plain man, dwelt in tents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">25:28</span>. Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting:  and Rebecca loved Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">25:29</span>. And Jacob boiled pottage:  to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">25:30</span>. Said:  Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint.  For which reason his name was called Edom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">25:31</span>. And Jacob said to him:  Sell me thy first birthright.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">25:32</span>. He answered:  Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">25:33</span>. Jacob said:  Swear therefore to me.  Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">25:34</span>. And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.<br/>

Isaac sojourneth in Gerara, where God reneweth to him the promise made to Abraham.  King Abimelech maketh league with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">26:1</span>. And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Palestines, to Gerara.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">26:2</span>. And the Lord appeared to him, and said:  Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">26:3</span>. And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfil the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">26:4</span>. And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven:  and I will give to thy posterity all these countries:  and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">26:5</span>. Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">26:6</span>. So Isaac abode in Gerara.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">26:7</span>. And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered:  She is my sister:  for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">26:8</span>. And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech, king of the Palestines, looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca, his wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-752">26:9</span>. And calling for him, he said:  It is evident she is thy wife:  why didst thou feign her to be thy sister?  He answered:  I feared lest I should die for her sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-753">26:10</span>. And Abimelech said:  Why hast thou deceived us?  Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin.  And he commanded all the people, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">26:11</span>. He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">26:12</span>. And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold:  and the Lord blessed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">26:13</span>. And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">26:14</span>. And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family.  Wherefore the Palestines envying him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">26:15</span>. Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, filling them up with earth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">26:16</span>. Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac:  Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">26:17</span>. So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">26:18</span>. And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father, Abraham, had digged, and which, after his death, the Philistines had of old stopped up:  and he called them by the same names, by which his father before had called them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">26:19</span>. And they digged in the torrent, and found living water:<br/>
<br/>
Torrent. . .That is, a channel where sometimes a torrent or violent stream had run.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-763">26:20</span>. But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying:  It is our water.  Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-764">26:21</span>. And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-765">26:22</span>. Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not; therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying:  Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Latitude. . .That is, wideness, or room.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-766">26:23</span>. And he went up from that place to Bersabee,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-767">26:24</span>. Where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying:  I am the God of Abraham thy father, do not fear, for I am with thee:  I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-768">26:25</span>. And he built there an altar:  and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-769">26:26</span>. To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers, came from Gerara,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-770">26:27</span>. Isaac said to them:  Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-771">26:28</span>. And they answered:  We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said:  Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-772">26:29</span>. That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-773">26:30</span>. And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-774">26:31</span>. Arising in the morning, they swore one to another:  and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-775">26:32</span>. And behold, the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying:  We have found water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-776">26:33</span>. Whereupon he called it Abundance:  and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-777">26:34</span>. And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hethite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same place.<br/>
<br/>

Jacob, by him mother's counsel, obtaineth his father's blessing instead of Esau.  And by her is advised to fly to his uncle Laban.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-781">27:1</span>. Now Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see: and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him:  My son?  And he answered:  Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-782">27:2</span>. And his father said to him, Thou seest that I am old, and know not the day of my death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-783">27:3</span>. Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go abroad; and when thou hast taken something by hunting,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-784">27:4</span>. Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou knowest I like, and bring it that I may eat:  and my soul may bless thee, before I die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-785">27:5</span>. And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father's commandment,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-786">27:6</span>. She said to her son Jacob:  I heard thy father talking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-787">27:7</span>. Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the Lord, before I die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-788">27:8</span>. Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-789">27:9</span>. And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he gladly eateth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-790">27:10</span>. Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-791">27:11</span>. And he answered her:  Thou knowest that Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am smooth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-792">27:12</span>. If my father should feel me, and perceive it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-793">27:13</span>. And his mother said to him:  Upon me be this curse, my son:  only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-794">27:14</span>. He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother.  She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-795">27:15</span>. And she put on him very good garments of Esau, which she had at home with her:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-796">27:16</span>. And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-797">27:17</span>. And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him bread that she had baked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-798">27:18</span>. Which when he had carried in, he said:  My father?  But he answered:  I hear.  Who art thou, my son?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-799">27:19</span>. And Jacob said:  I am Esau, thy firstborn:  I have done as thou didst command me:  arise, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.<br/>
<br/>
I am Esau thy firstborn. . .St. Augustine (L. Contra mendacium, c. 10), treating at large upon this place, excuseth Jacob from a lie, because this whole passage was mysterious, as relating to the preference which was afterwards to be given to the Gentiles before the carnal Jews, which Jacob by prophetic light might understand.  So far is certain, that the first birthright, both by divine election and by Esau's free cession belonged to Jacob:  so that if there were any lie in the case, it could be no more than an officious and venial one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-800">27:20</span>. And Isaac said to his son:  How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son?  He answered:  It was the will of God, that what I sought came quickly in my way:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-801">27:21</span>. And Isaac said:  Come hither, that I may feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou be my son Esau, or no.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-802">27:22</span>. He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said:  The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of Esau.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-803">27:23</span>. And he knew him not, because his hairy hands made him like to the elder.  Then blessing him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-804">27:24</span>. He said:  Art thou my son Esau?  He answered:  I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-805">27:25</span>. Then he said:  Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.  And when they were brought, and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had drunk,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">27:26</span>. He said to him:  Come near me, and give me a kiss, my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-807">27:27</span>. He came near, and kissed him.  And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he said:  Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord hath blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-808">27:28</span>. God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-809">27:29</span>. And let peoples serve thee, and tribes worship thee:  be thou lord of thy brethren, and let thy mother's children bow down before thee.  Cursed be he that curseth thee:  and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-810">27:30</span>. Isaac had scarce ended his words, when, Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-811">27:31</span>. And brought in to his father meats, made of what he had taken in hunting, saying:  Arise, my father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy soul may bless me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-812">27:32</span>. And Isaac said to him:  Why! who art thou?  He answered:  I am thy firstborn son, Esau.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-813">27:33</span>. Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be believed, said:  Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest?  and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-814">27:34</span>. Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry; and, being in a consternation, said:  Bless me also, my father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-815">27:35</span>. And he said:  Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-816">27:36</span>. But he said again:  Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time:  My birthright he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing.  And again he said to his father:  Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?<br/>
<br/>
Jacob. . .That is, a supplanter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-817">27:37</span>. Isaac answered:  I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants:  I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-818">27:38</span>. And Esau said to him:  Hast thou only one blessing, father?  I beseech thee bless me also.  And when he wept with a loud cry,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">27:39</span>. Isaac being moved, said to him:  In the fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">27:40</span>. Shall thy blessing be.  Thou shalt live by the sword, and shalt serve thy brother:  and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-821">27:41</span>. Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and he said in his heart:  The days will come of the mourning for my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-822">27:42</span>. These things were told to Rebecca:  and she sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to him:  Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to kill thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-823">27:43</span>. Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise and flee to Laban, my brother, to Haran:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-824">27:44</span>. And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-825">27:45</span>. And his indignation cease, and he forget the things thou hast done to him:  afterwards I will send, and bring thee from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-826">27:46</span>. And Rebecca said to Isaac:  I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth:  if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live.<br/>

Jacob's journey to Mesopotamia:  his vision and vow.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">28:10</span>. But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to Haran.<br/>

Jacob serveth Laban seven years for Rachel:  but is deceived with Lia: he afterwards marrieth Rachel.  Lia bears him four sons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">29:1</span>. Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came into the east country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">29:2</span>. And he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying by it:  for the beasts were watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">29:3</span>. And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together, to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were watered, to put it on the mouth of the well again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">29:4</span>. And he said to the shepherds:  Brethren, whence are you?  They answered:  Of Haran.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">29:5</span>. And he asked them, saying:  Know you Laban, the son of Nachor? They said:  We know him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">29:6</span>. He said:  Is he in health?  He is in health, say they:  and behold, Rachel, his daughter, cometh with his flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-859">29:7</span>. And Jacob said:  There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again:  first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-860">29:8</span>. They answered:  We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the flocks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">29:9</span>. They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she fed the flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">29:10</span>. And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle:  he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">29:11</span>. And having watered the flock, he kissed her:  and lifting up his voice wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">29:12</span>. And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca:  but she went in haste and told her father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">29:13</span>. Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him:  and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house.  And when he had heard the causes of his journey,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-866">29:14</span>. He answered:  Thou art my bone and my flesh.  And after the days of one month were expired,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-867">29:15</span>. He said to him:  Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages?  Tell me what wages thou wilt have.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">29:16</span>. Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia; and the younger was called Rachel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">29:17</span>. But Lia was blear-eyed:  Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">29:18</span>. And Jacob being in love with her, said:  I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">29:19</span>. Laban answered:  It is better that I give her to thee than to another man; stay with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">29:20</span>. So Jacob served seven years for Rachel:  and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">29:21</span>. And he said to Laban:  Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-874">29:22</span>. And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-875">29:23</span>. And at night he brought in Lia, his daughter, to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-876">29:24</span>. Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha.  Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom, when morning was come he saw it was Lia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-877">29:25</span>. And he said to his father-in-law:  What is it that thou didst mean to do?  did not I serve thee for Rachel?  why hast thou deceived me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-878">29:26</span>. Laban answered:  It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">29:27</span>. Make up the week of days of this match:  and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-880">29:28</span>. He yielded to his pleasure:  and after the week was past, he married Rachel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-881">29:29</span>. To whom her father gave Bala, for her servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">29:30</span>. And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">29:31</span>. And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">29:32</span>. And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying:  The Lord saw my affliction:  now my husband will love me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">29:33</span>. And again she conceived and bore a son, and said:  Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me:  and she called his name Simeon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">29:34</span>. And she conceived the third time, and bore another son, and said:  Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons:  and therefore she called his name Levi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">29:35</span>. The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said:  Now will I praise the Lord:  and for this she called him Juda.  And she left bearing.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-920">30:31</span>. And Laban said:  What shall I give thee?  But he said:  I require nothing; but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-921">30:32</span>. Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-922">30:33</span>. And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of theft.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-923">30:34</span>. And Laban said:  I like well what thou demandest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-924">30:35</span>. And he separated the same day the she-goats, and the sheep, and the he-goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-925">30:36</span>. And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son-in-law, who fed the rest of his flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-926">30:37</span>. And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane-trees, and pilled them in part:  so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness:  but the parts that were whole, remained green:  and by this means the colour was divers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-927">30:38</span>. And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-928">30:39</span>. And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-929">30:40</span>. And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were Laban's, and the rest were Jacob's, when the flocks were separated one from the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-930">30:41</span>. So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-931">30:42</span>. But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them.  And those that were lateward, became Laban's; and they of the first time, Jacob's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-932">30:43</span>. And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maid-servants and men-servants, camels and asses.</p>

Jacob's departure:  he is pursued and overtaken by Laban.  They make a covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-935">31:1</span>. But after that he had heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying:  Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's, and being enriched by his substance is become great.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-936">31:2</span>. And perceiving also, that Laban's countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-937">31:3</span>. Especially the Lord saying to him:  Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-938">31:4</span>. He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-939">31:5</span>. And said to them:  I see your father's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day:  but the God of my father hath been with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-940">31:6</span>. And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-941">31:7</span>. Yea your father hath also overreached me, and hath changed my wages ten times:  and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-942">31:8</span>. If at any time, he said:  The speckled shall be thy wages:  all the sheep brought forth speckled:  but when he said on the contrary:  Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages:  all the flocks brought forth white ones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-943">31:9</span>. And God hath taken your father's substance, and given it to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-944">31:10</span>. For after the time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-945">31:11</span>. And the angel of God said to me in my sleep:  Jacob.  And I answered:  Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-946">31:12</span>. And he said:  Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-947">31:13</span>. I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me.  Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-948">31:14</span>. And Rachel and Lia answered:  Have we any thing left among the goods and inheritance of our father's house?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-949">31:15</span>. Hath he not counted us as strangers, and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-950">31:16</span>. But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children:  wherefore, do all that God hath commanded thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-951">31:17</span>. Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-952">31:18</span>. And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land of Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-953">31:19</span>. At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.<br/>
<br/>
Her father's idols. . .By this it appears that Laban was an idolater; and some of the fathers are of opinion that Rachel stole away these idols to withdraw him from idolatry, removing the occasion of his sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-954">31:20</span>. And Jacob would not confess to his father-in-law that he was flying away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-955">31:21</span>. And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-956">31:22</span>. It was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob fled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-957">31:23</span>. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-958">31:24</span>. And he saw in a dream God, saying to him:  Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-959">31:25</span>. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain:  and when he, with his brethren, had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-960">31:26</span>. And he said to Jacob:  Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters as captives taken with the sword?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-961">31:27</span>. Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-962">31:28</span>. Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and now indeed,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-963">31:29</span>. It is in my power to return thee evil; but the God of your father said to me yesterday:  Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">31:30</span>. Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's house:  why hast thou stolen away my gods?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">31:31</span>. Jacob answered:  That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-966">31:32</span>. But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft:  with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren.  Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away.  Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-967">31:33</span>. So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not.  And when he was entered into Rachel's tent,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">31:34</span>. She, in haste, hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them:  and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">31:35</span>. She said:  Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women.  So his careful search was in vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">31:36</span>. And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner:  For what fault of mine, and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">31:37</span>. And searched all my household stuff?  What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house?  lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">31:38</span>. Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty years?  thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">31:39</span>. Neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn; I made good all the damage:  whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-974">31:40</span>. Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">31:41</span>. And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks:  thou hast changed also my wages ten times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-976">31:42</span>. Unless the God of my father, Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked:  God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-977">31:43</span>. Laban answered him:  The daughters are mine, and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine:  what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-978">31:44</span>. Come, therefore, let us enter into a league; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">31:45</span>. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">31:46</span>. And he said to his brethren:  Bring hither stones.  And they, gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">31:47</span>. And Laban called it, The witness heap; and Jacob, The hillock of testimony:  each of them according to the propriety of his language.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-982">31:48</span>. And Laban said:  This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-983">31:49</span>. The Lord behold and judge between us, when we shall be gone one from the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-984">31:50</span>. If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them:  none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-985">31:51</span>. And he said again to Jacob:  Behold this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-986">31:52</span>. Shall be a witness:  this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">31:53</span>. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us.  And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">31:54</span>. And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.  And when they had eaten, they lodged there:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">31:55</span>. But Laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them:  and returned to his place.<br/>

Jacob's vision of angels; his message and presents to Esau; his wrestling with an angel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">32:1</span>. Jacob also went on the journey he had begun:  and the angels of God met him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">32:2</span>. And when he saw them, he said:  These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">32:3</span>. And he sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">32:4</span>. And he commanded them, saying:  Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau:  Thus saith thy brother Jacob:  I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">32:5</span>. I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants:  and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">32:6</span>. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying:  We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-998">32:7</span>. Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-999">32:8</span>. Saying:  If Esau come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left, shall escape.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1000">32:9</span>. And Jacob said:  O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac:  O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1001">32:10</span>. I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant.  With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1002">32:11</span>. Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1003">32:12</span>. Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1004">32:13</span>. And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1005">32:14</span>. Two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1006">32:15</span>. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten of their foals.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1007">32:16</span>. And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants:  Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1008">32:17</span>. And he commanded the first, saying:  If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee:  Whose art thou?  or whither goest thou?  or whose are these before thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1009">32:18</span>. Thou shalt answer:  Thy servant Jacob's:  he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1010">32:19</span>. In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying:  Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1011">32:20</span>. And ye shall add:  Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us; for he said:  I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1012">32:21</span>. So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1013">32:22</span>. And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1014">32:23</span>. And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1015">32:24</span>. He remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.<br/>
<br/>
A man, etc. . .This was an angel in human shape, as we learn from Osee 12.4. He is called God, ver. 28 and 30, because he represented the person of the Son of God.  This wrestling, in which Jacob, assisted by God, was a match for an angel, was so ordered (ver. 28,) that he might learn by this experiment of the divine assistance, that neither Esau, nor any other man, should have power to hurt him.--It was also spiritual, as appeareth by his earnest prayer, urging and at last obtaining the angel's blessing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1016">32:25</span>. And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1017">32:26</span>. And he said to him:  Let me go, for it is break of day.  He answered:  I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1018">32:27</span>. And he said:  What is thy name?  He answered:  Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1019">32:28</span>. But he said:  Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1020">32:29</span>. Jacob asked him:  Tell me by what name art thou called?  He answered:  Why dost thou ask my name?  And he blessed him in the same place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1021">32:30</span>. And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying:  I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.<br/>
<br/>
Phanuel. . .This word signifies the face of God, or the sight, or seeing of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1022">32:31</span>. And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1023">32:32</span>. Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh:  because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1033">33:8</span>. And Esau said:  What are the droves that I met?  He answered:  That I might find favour before my lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1034">33:9</span>. But he said:  I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1035">33:10</span>. And Jacob said:  Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands:  for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God:  be gracious to me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1036">33:11</span>. And take the blessing which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things.  He took it with much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1037">33:12</span>. And said:  Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1038">33:13</span>. And Jacob said:  My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young:  which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1039">33:14</span>. May it please my lord to go before his servant:  and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1040">33:15</span>. Esau answered:  I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way.  And he said:  There is no necessity:  I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1041">33:16</span>. So Esau returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1042">33:17</span>. And Jacob came to Socoth:  where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1043">33:18</span>. And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1044">33:19</span>. And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred lambs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1045">33:20</span>. And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.</p>

Dina is ravished, for which the Sichemites are destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1048">34:1</span>. And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1049">34:2</span>. And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her:  and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1050">34:3</span>. And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1051">34:4</span>. And going to Hemor his father, he said:  Get me this damsel to wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1052">34:5</span>. But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1053">34:6</span>. And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1054">34:7</span>. Behold his sons came from the field:  and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob's daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1055">34:8</span>. And Hemor spoke to them:  The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter:  give her him to wife:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1056">34:9</span>. And let us contract marriages one with another:  give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1057">34:10</span>. And dwell with us:  the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1058">34:11</span>. Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren:  Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1059">34:12</span>. Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand:  only give me this damsel to wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1060">34:13</span>. The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their sister:<br/>
<br/>
Deceitfully. . .The sons of Jacob, on this occasion, were guilty of a grievous sin, as well by falsely pretending religion, as by excess of revenge:  though otherwise their zeal against so foul a crime was commendable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1061">34:14</span>. We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1062">34:15</span>. But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1063">34:16</span>. Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1064">34:17</span>. But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1065">34:18</span>. Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1066">34:19</span>. And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required:  for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1067">34:20</span>. And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1069">34:22</span>. One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred:  We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1070">34:23</span>. And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1071">34:24</span>. And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1072">34:25</span>. And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest:  two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1073">34:26</span>. And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1074">34:27</span>. And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1075">34:28</span>. And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1076">34:29</span>. And their children and wives they took captive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1077">34:30</span>. And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi:  You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land.  We are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1078">34:31</span>. They answered:  Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1081">35:1</span>. In the mean time God said to Jacob:  Arise and go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau, thy brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1082">35:2</span>. And Jacob having called together all his household, said:  Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed, and change your garments.<br/>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 37<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1156"/>

Joseph's dreams:  he is sold by his brethren, and carried into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1157">37:1</span>. And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1158">37:2</span>. And these are his generations:  Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy:  and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives:  and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1159">37:3</span>. Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age:  and he made him a coat of divers colours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1160">37:4</span>. And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated hem, and could not speak peaceably to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1161">37:5</span>. Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed:  which occasioned them to hate him the more.<br/>
<br/>
A dream. . .These dreams of Joseph were prophetical, and sent from God; as were also those which he interpreted, Gen. 40. and 41.; otherwise generally speaking, the observing of dreams is condemned in the Scripture, as superstitious and sinful.  See Deut. 18.10; Eccli. 34.2,3.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1162">37:6</span>. And he said to them:  Hear my dream which I dreamed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1163">37:7</span>. I thought we were binding sheaves in the field:  and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down before my sheaf.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1164">37:8</span>. His brethren answered:  Shalt thou be our king?  or shall we be subject to thy dominion?  Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1165">37:9</span>. He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying:  I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1166">37:10</span>. And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his father rebuked him and said:  What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed?  shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?<br/>
<br/>
Worship. . .This word is not used here to signify divine worship, but an inferior veneration, expressed by the bowing of the body, and that, according to the manner of the eastern nations, down to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1167">37:11</span>. His brethren therefore envied him:  but his father considered the thing with himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1168">37:12</span>. And when his brethren abode in Sechem, feeding their father's flocks,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1169">37:13</span>. Israel said to him:  Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem:  come, I will send thee to them.  And when he answered:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1170">37:14</span>. I am ready:  he said to him:  Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle:  and bring me word again what is doing.  So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1171">37:15</span>. And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1172">37:16</span>. But he answered:  I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1173">37:17</span>. And the man said to him:  They are departed from this place:  for I heard them say:  Let us go to Dothain.  And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1174">37:18</span>. And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1175">37:19</span>. And said one to another:  Behold the dreamer cometh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1176">37:20</span>. Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit:  and we will say:  Some evil beast hath devoured him:  and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1177">37:21</span>. And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1178">37:22</span>. Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood:  but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless:  now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1179">37:23</span>. And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1180">37:24</span>. And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1181">37:25</span>. And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1182">37:26</span>. And Juda said to his brethren:  What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1183">37:27</span>. It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled:  for he is our brother and our flesh.  His brethren agreed to his words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1184">37:28</span>. And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1185">37:29</span>. And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1186">37:30</span>. And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said:  The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1187">37:31</span>. And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1188">37:32</span>. Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say:  This we have found:  see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1189">37:33</span>. And the father acknowledging it, said:  It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1190">37:34</span>. And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1191">37:35</span>. And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said:  I will go down to my son into hell, mourning.  And whilst he continued weeping,<br/>
<br/>
Into hell. . .That is, into limbo, the place where the souls of the just were received before the death of our Redeemer.  For allowing that the word hell sometimes is taken for the grave, it cannot be so taken in this place; since Jacob did not believe his son to be in the grave, (whom he supposed to be devoured by a wild beast,) and therefore could not mean to go down to him thither:  but certainly meant the place of rest where he believed his soul to be.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1192">37:36</span>. The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
An eunuch. . .This word sometimes signifies a chamberlain, courtier, or officer of the king:  and so it is taken in this place.<br/>

The sons of Juda:  the death of Her and Onan:  the birth of Phares and Zara.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1195">38:1</span>. At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1196">38:2</span>. And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1197">38:3</span>. And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1198">38:4</span>. And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him Onan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1199">38:5</span>. She bore also a third:  whom she called Sela.  After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1200">38:6</span>. And Juda took a wife for Her, his first born, whose name was Thamar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1201">38:7</span>. And Her, the first born of Juda, was wicked in the sight of the Lord:  and was slain by him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1202">38:8</span>. Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son:  Go in to thy brother's wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1203">38:9</span>. He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother's name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1204">38:10</span>. And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did a detestable thing:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1205">38:11</span>. Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter-in-law:  Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Sela my son grow up:  for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did.  She went her way, and dwelt in her father's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1206">38:12</span>. And after many days were past:  the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died:  and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1207">38:13</span>. And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1208">38:14</span>. And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1209">38:15</span>. When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot:  for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1210">38:16</span>. And going to her, he said:  Suffer me to lie with thee:  for he knew her not to be his daughter-in-law.  And she answered:  What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1211">38:17</span>. He said:  I will send thee a kid out of the flock.  And when she said again:  I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1212">38:18</span>. Juda said:  What wilt thou have for a pledge?  She answered:  Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand.  The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1213">38:19</span>. And she arose and went her way:  and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1214">38:20</span>. And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman:  but he, not finding her,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1215">38:21</span>. Asked the men of that place:  Where is the woman that sat in the cross way?  And when they all made answer:  There was no harlot in this place,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1216">38:22</span>. He returned to Juda, and said to him:  I have not found her; moreover, the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1217">38:23</span>. Juda said:  Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised:  and thou didst not find her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1218">38:24</span>. And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying:  Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly.  And Juda said:  Bring her out that she may be burnt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1219">38:25</span>. But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying:  By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1220">38:26</span>. But he acknowledging the gifts, said:  She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son.  However he knew her no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1221">38:27</span>. And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb:  and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1222">38:28</span>. This shall come forth the first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1223">38:29</span>. But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth:  and the woman said:  Why is the partition divided for thee?  and therefore called his name Phares.<br/>
<br/>
Phares. . .That is, a breach or division.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1224">38:30</span>. Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread:  and she called his name Zara.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1259">40:8</span>. They answered:  We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us.  And Joseph said to them:  Doth not interpretation belong to God?  Tell me what you have dreamed:<br/>
<br/>
Doth not interpretation belong to God?. . .When dreams are from God, as these were, the interpretation of them is a gift of God.  But the generality of dreams are not of this sort; but either proceed from the natural complexions and dispositions of persons, or the roving of their imaginations in the day on such objects as they are much affected with, or from their mind being disturbed with cares and troubles, and oppressed with bodily infirmities:  or they are suggested by evil spirits, to flatter, or to terrify weak minds, in order to gain belief, and so draw them into error or superstition; or at least to trouble them in their sleep, whom they cannot move when they are awake:  so that the general rule, with regard to dreams, is not to observe them, nor to give any credit to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1260">40:9</span>. The chief butler first told his dream:  I saw before me a vine,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1261">40:10</span>. On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1262">40:11</span>. And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:  and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1263">40:12</span>. Joseph answered:  This is the interpretation of the dream:  The three branches, are yet three days:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1264">40:13</span>. After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place:  and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1265">40:14</span>. Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness:  to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1266">40:15</span>. For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1267">40:16</span>. The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said:  I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1268">40:17</span>. And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1269">40:18</span>. Joseph answered:  This is the interpretation of the dream:  The three baskets, are yet three days:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1270">40:19</span>. After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1271">40:20</span>. The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao:  and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1272">40:21</span>. And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1273">40:22</span>. The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1274">40:23</span>. But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.</p>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 41<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1276"/>

Joseph interpreteth the two dreams of Pharao:  he is made ruler over all Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1277">41:1</span>. After two years Pharao had a dream.  He thought he stood by the river,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1278">41:2</span>. Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat:  and they fed in marshy places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1279">41:3</span>. Other seven also came up out of the river, ill-favoured, and lean fleshed:  and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1280">41:4</span>. And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned.  So Pharao awoke.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1281">41:5</span>. He slept again, and dreamed another dream:  Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1282">41:6</span>. Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1283">41:7</span>. And devoured all the beauty of the former.  Pharao awaked after his rest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1284">41:8</span>. And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men:  and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1285">41:9</span>. Then at length the chief butler remembering, said:  I confess my sin:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1286">41:10</span>. The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1287">41:11</span>. Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1288">41:12</span>. There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers:  to whom we told our dreams,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1289">41:13</span>. And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so.  For I was restored to my office:  and he was hanged upon a gibbet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1290">41:14</span>. Forthwith at the king's command Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him:  and changing his apparel brought him in to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1291">41:15</span>. And he said to him:  I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them:  Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1292">41:16</span>. Joseph answered:  Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1293">41:17</span>. So Pharao told what he had dreamed:  Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1294">41:18</span>. And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh:  and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1295">41:19</span>. And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill-favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1296">41:20</span>. And they devoured and consumed the former,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1297">41:21</span>. And yet gave no mark of their being full:  but were as lean and ill-favoured as before.  I awoke, and then fell asleep again,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1298">41:22</span>. And dreamed a dream:  Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1299">41:23</span>. Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1300">41:24</span>. And they devoured the beauty of the former:  I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1301">41:25</span>. Joseph answered:  The king's dream is one:  God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1302">41:26</span>. The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty:  and both contain the same meaning of the dream.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1303">41:27</span>. And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1304">41:28</span>. Which shall be fulfilled in this order.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1305">41:29</span>. Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1306">41:30</span>. After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten:  for the famine shall consume all the land,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1307">41:31</span>. And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1308">41:32</span>. And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing:  it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1309">41:33</span>. Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1310">41:34</span>. That he may appoint overseers over all the countries:  and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1311">41:35</span>. That shall now presently ensue:  and let all the corn be laid up, under Pharao's hands, and be reserved in the cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1312">41:36</span>. And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1313">41:37</span>. The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1314">41:38</span>. And he said to them:  Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1315">41:39</span>. He said therefore to Joseph:  Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1316">41:40</span>. Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey:  only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1317">41:41</span>. And again Pharao said to Joseph:  Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1318">41:42</span>. And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand:  and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1319">41:43</span>. And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1320">41:44</span>. And the king said to Joseph:  I am Pharao:  without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1321">41:45</span>. And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world.  And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis.  Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The saviour of the world. . .Zaphnah paaneah.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1322">41:46</span>. (Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao), and he went round all the countries of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1323">41:47</span>. And the fruitfulness of the seven years came:  and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1324">41:48</span>. And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1325">41:49</span>. And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1326">41:50</span>. And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born:  whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1327">41:51</span>. And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying:  God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house.<br/>
<br/>
Manasses. . .That is, oblivion, or forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1328">41:52</span>. And he named the second Ephraim, saying:  God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.<br/>
<br/>
Ephraim. . .That is, fruitful, or growing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1329">41:53</span>. Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1330">41:54</span>. The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come:  and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1331">41:55</span>. And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao, for food.  And he said to them:  Go to Joseph:  and do all that he shall say to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1332">41:56</span>. And the famine increased daily in all the land:  and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians:  for the famine had oppressed them also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1333">41:57</span>. And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-1334-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Genesis Chapter 42<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1335"/>
</b><br/>
Jacob sendeth his ten sons to buy corn in Egypt.  Their treatment by Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1336">42:1</span>. And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1337">42:2</span>. I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt:  Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1338">42:3</span>. So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1339">42:4</span>. Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren:  Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1340">42:5</span>. And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy.  For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1341">42:6</span>. And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people.  And when his brethren had bowed down to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1342">42:7</span>. And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them:  Whence came you?  They answered:  From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1343">42:8</span>. And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1344">42:9</span>. And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them:  You are spies.  You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.<br/>
<br/>
You are spies. . .This he said by way of examining them, to see what they would answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1345">42:10</span>. But they said:  It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1346">42:11</span>. We are all the sons of one man:  we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1347">42:12</span>. And he answered them:  It is otherwise:  you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1348">42:13</span>. But they said:  We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan:  the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1349">42:14</span>. He saith, This is it that I said:  You are spies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1350">42:15</span>. I shall now presently try what you are:  by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1351">42:16</span>. Send one of you to fetch him:  and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false:  or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.<br/>
<br/>
Or else by the health of Pharao you are spies. . .That is, if these things you say be proved false, you are to be held for spies for your lying, and shall be treated as such.  Joseph dealt in this manner with his brethren, to bring them by the means of affliction to a sense of their former sin, and a sincere repentance for it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1352">42:17</span>. So he put them in prison three days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1353">42:18</span>. And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said:  Do as I have said, and you shall live:  for I fear God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1354">42:19</span>. If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison:  and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1355">42:20</span>. And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die.  They did as he had said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1356">42:21</span>. And they talked one to another:  We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear:  therefore is this affliction come upon us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1357">42:22</span>. And Ruben, one of them, said:  Did not I say to you:  Do not sin against the boy; and you would not hear me?  Behold his blood is required.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1358">42:23</span>. And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1359">42:24</span>. And he turned himself away a little while, and wept:  and returning, he spoke to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1360">42:25</span>. And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way:  and they did so.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1361">42:26</span>. But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1362">42:27</span>. And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1363">42:28</span>. And said to his brethren:  My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack.  And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another:  What is this that God hath done unto us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1364">42:29</span>. And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1365">42:30</span>. The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1366">42:31</span>. And we answered him:  We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1367">42:32</span>. We are twelve brethren born of one father:  one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1368">42:33</span>. And he said to us:  Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men:  Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1369">42:34</span>. And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies:  and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1370">42:35</span>. When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack:  and all being astonished together,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1371">42:36</span>. Their father Jacob said:  You have made me to be without children:  Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away:  all these evils are fallen upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1372">42:37</span>. And Ruben answered him:  Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee:  deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1373">42:38</span>. But he said:  My son shall not go down with you:  his brother is dead, and he is left alone:  if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell.<br/>
<br/>
To hell. . .That is, to that place, where the souls then remained, as above, chapter 37. ver. 35.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1377">43:2</span>. And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons:  Go again, and buy us a little food.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1378">43:3</span>. Juda answered:  The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath, saying:  You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1379">43:4</span>. If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1380">43:5</span>. But if thou wilt not, we will not go:  for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying:  You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1381">43:6</span>. Israel said to them:  You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1382">43:7</span>. But they answered:  The man asked us in order concerning our kindred:  if our father lived:  if we had a brother:  and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded:  could we know that he would say:  Bring hither your brother with you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1383">43:8</span>. And Juda said to his father:  Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live:  lest both we and our children perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1384">43:9</span>. I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand:  unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1385">43:10</span>. If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1386">43:11</span>. Then Israel said to them:  If it must needs be so, do what you will:  take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.<br/>
<br/>
Balm. . .Literally rosin, resinae; but here by that name is meant balm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1387">43:12</span>. And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1388">43:13</span>. And take also your brother, and go to the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1389">43:14</span>. And may my almighty God make him favourable to you:  and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:  and as for me I shall be desolate without children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1390">43:15</span>. So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1391">43:16</span>. And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying:  Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast:  because they shall eat with me at noon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1392">43:17</span>. He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1393">43:18</span>. And they being much afraid, said there one to another:  Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in:  that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1394">43:19</span>. Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1395">43:20</span>. They said:  Sir, we desire thee to hear us.  We came down once before to buy food:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1396">43:21</span>. And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks:  which we have now brought again in the same weight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1397">43:22</span>. And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want:  we cannot tell who put it in our bags.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1398">43:23</span>. But he answered:  Peace be with you, fear not:  your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks.  For the money, which you gave me, I have for good.  And he brought Simeon out to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1399">43:24</span>. And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1400">43:25</span>. But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1401">43:26</span>. Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their face to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1402">43:27</span>. But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying:  Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me?  Is he yet living?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1403">43:28</span>. And they answered:  Thy servant our father, is in health; he is yet living.  And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1404">43:29</span>. And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, and said:  Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said:  God be gracious to thee, my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1405">43:30</span>. And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out:  and going into his chamber, he wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1406">43:31</span>. And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said:  Set bread on the table.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1407">43:32</span>. And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1408">43:33</span>. They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age.  And they wondered very much;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1409">43:34</span>. Taking the messes which they received of him:  and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts.  And they drank, and were merry with him.<br/>

<br/>
Joseph's contrivance to stop his brethren.  The humble supplication of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1412">44:1</span>. And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying:  Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold:  and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1413">44:2</span>. And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat.  And it was so done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1414">44:3</span>. And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1415">44:4</span>. And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way:  Joseph sending for the steward of his house, said:  Arise, and pursue after the men:  and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them:  Why have you returned evil for good?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1416">44:5</span>. The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine:  you have done a very evil thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1417">44:6</span>. He did as he had commanded him.  And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1418">44:7</span>. And they answered:  Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1419">44:8</span>. The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan:  how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1420">44:9</span>. With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1421">44:10</span>. And he said to them:  Let it be according to your sentence:  with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1422">44:11</span>. Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1423">44:12</span>. Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1424">44:13</span>. Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1425">44:14</span>. And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1426">44:15</span>. And he said to them:  Why would you do so?  know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.<br/>
<br/>
The science of divining. . .He speaks of himself according to what he was esteemed in that kingdom.  And indeed, he being truly a prophet, knew more without comparison than any of the Egyptian sorcerers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1427">44:16</span>. And Juda said to him:  What shall we answer my lord?  or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege?  God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:  behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1428">44:17</span>. Joseph answered:  God forbid that I should do so:  he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman:  and go you away free to your father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1429">44:18</span>. Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly:  I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy servant:  for after Pharao thou art.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1430">44:19</span>. My lord.  Thou didst ask thy servants the first time:  Have you a father or a brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1431">44:20</span>. And we answered thee, my lord:  We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1432">44:21</span>. And thou saidst to thy servants:  Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1433">44:22</span>. We suggested to my lord:  The boy cannot leave his father:  for if he leave him, he will die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1434">44:23</span>. And thou saidst to thy servants:  Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1435">44:24</span>. Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1436">44:25</span>. And our father said:  Go again, and buy us a little wheat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1437">44:26</span>. And we said to him:  We cannot go:  if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together:  otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1438">44:27</span>. Whereunto he answered:  You know that my wife bore me two.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1439">44:28</span>. One went out, and you said:  A beast devoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1440">44:29</span>. If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1441">44:30</span>. Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1442">44:31</span>. And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.<br/>
<br/>
His gray hairs. . .That is, his person, now far advanced in years.--With sorrow unto hell. . .The Hebrew word for hell is here sheol, the Greek hades:  it is not taken for the hell of the damned; but for that place of souls below where the servants of God were kept before the coming of Christ.  Which place, both in the Scripture and in the creed, is named hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1443">44:32</span>. Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying:  If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1444">44:33</span>. Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1445">44:34</span>. For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</p>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1450">45:3</span>. And he said to his brethren:  I am Joseph:  Is my father yet living?  His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1451">45:4</span>. And he said mildly to them:  Come nearer to me.  And when they were come near him, he said:  I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1454">45:7</span>. And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1455">45:8</span>. Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1456">45:9</span>. Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him:  Thus saith thy son Joseph:  God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come down to me, linger not.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1466">45:19</span>. Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say:  Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1469">45:22</span>. He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes:  but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best:<br/>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 47<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1513"/>
</b><br/>
Jacob and his sons are presented before Pharao:  he giveth them the land of Gessen.  The famine forceth the Egyptians to sell all their possessions to the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1514">47:1</span>. Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying:  My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan:  and behold they stay in the land of Gessen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1515">47:2</span>. Five men also, the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:<br/>
<br/>
The last. . .xtremos.  Some interpret this word of the chiefest, and most rightly:  but Joseph seems rather to have chosen out such as had the meanest appearance, that Pharao might not think of employing them at court, with danger of their morals and religion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1516">47:3</span>. And he asked them:  What is your occupation?  They answered:  We, thy servants, are shepherds, both we and our fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1517">47:4</span>. We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan:  and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1518">47:5</span>. The king therefore said to Joseph:  Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1519">47:6</span>. The land of Egypt is before thee:  and make them dwell in the best place, and give them the land of Gessen.  And if thou knowest that there are industrious men among them, make them rulers over my cattle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1520">47:7</span>. After this Joseph brought in his father to the king, and presented him before him:  and he blessed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1521">47:8</span>. And being asked by him:  How many are the days of the years of thy life?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1522">47:9</span>. He answered:  The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1523">47:10</span>. And blessing the king, he went out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1524">47:11</span>. But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1525">47:12</span>. And he nourished them, and all his father's house, allowing food to every one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1526">47:13</span>. For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had oppressed the land, more especially of Egypt and Chanaan;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1527">47:14</span>. Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it in to the king's treasure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1528">47:15</span>. And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying:  Give us bread:  why should we die in thy presence, having now no money?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1529">47:16</span>. And he answered them:  Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1530">47:17</span>. And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses:  and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1531">47:18</span>. And they came the second year, and said to him:  We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone:  neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1532">47:19</span>. Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes?  we will be thine, both we and our lands:  buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1533">47:20</span>. So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine.  And he brought it into Pharao's hands:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1534">47:21</span>. And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1535">47:22</span>. Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king:  to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1536">47:23</span>. Then Joseph said to the people:  Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao; take seed and sow the fields,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1537">47:24</span>. That you may have corn.  The fifth part you shall give to the king; the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1538">47:25</span>. And they answered:  our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1539">47:26</span>. From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the kings, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1540">47:27</span>. So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1541">47:28</span>. And he lived in it seventeen years:  and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1542">47:29</span>. And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him:  If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1543">47:30</span>. But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors.  And Joseph answered him:  I will do what thou hast commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1544">47:31</span>. And he said:  Swear then to me.  And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's head.<br/>
<br/>
To the bed's head. . .St. Paul, Heb. 11.21, following the Greek translation of the Septuagint, reads adored the top of his rod.  Where note, that the same word in the Hebrew, according to the different pointing of it, signifies both a bed and a rod.  And to verify both these sentences, we must understand that Jacob leaning on Joseph's rod adored, turning towards the head of his bed:  which adoration, inasmuch as it was referred to God, was an absolute and sovereign worship:  but inasmuch as it was referred to the rod of Joseph, as a figure of the sceptre, that is, of the royal dignity of Christ, was only an inferior and relative honour.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1547">48:1</span>. After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick; and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1548">48:2</span>. And it was told the old man:  Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee.  And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1549">48:3</span>. And when Joseph was come in to him, he said:  God almighty appeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed me,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1550">48:4</span>. And said:  I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people:  and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1552">48:6</span>. But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1553">48:7</span>. For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey, and it was spring time:  and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1554">48:8</span>. Then seeing his sons, he said to him:  Who are these?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1555">48:9</span>. He answered:  They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.  And he said:  Bring them to me, that I may bless them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1556">48:10</span>. For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly.  And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1557">48:11</span>. And said to his son:  I am not deprived of seeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy seed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1558">48:12</span>. And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1559">48:13</span>. And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1560">48:14</span>. But he, stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses, who was the elder, changing his hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1561">48:15</span>. And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said:  God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1563">48:17</span>. And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased:  and taking his father's hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1564">48:18</span>. And he said to his father:  It should not be so, my father; for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.<br/>

Jacob's prophetical blessings of his twelve sons:  his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1571">49:1</span>. And Jacob called his sons, and said to them:  Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1572">49:2</span>. Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye sons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1573">49:3</span>. Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in gifts, greater in command.<br/>
<br/>
My strength, etc. . .He calls him his strength, as being born whilst his father was in his full strength and vigour:  he calls him the beginning of his sorrow, because cares and sorrows usually come on with the birth of children.  Excelling in gifts, etc., because the firstborn had a title to a double portion, and to have the command over his brethren, which Ruben forfeited by his sin; being poured out as water, that is, spilt and lost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1574">49:4</span>. Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch.<br/>
<br/>
Grow thou not. . .This was not meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but by way of a prophecy foretelling that the tribe of Ruben should not inherit the pre-eminences usually annexed to the first birthright, viz., the double portion, the being prince or lord over the other brethren, and the priesthood:  of which the double portion was given to Joseph, the princely office to Juda, and the priesthood to Levi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1575">49:5</span>. Simeon and Levi brethren:  vessels of iniquity waging war.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1576">49:6</span>. Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory be in their assembly:  because in their fury they slew a man, and in their self-will they undermined a wall.<br/>
<br/>
Slew a man,. . .viz., Sichem the son of Hemor, with all his people, Gen. 34.; mystically and prophetically it alludes to Christ, whom their posterity, viz., the priests and the scribes, put to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1577">49:7</span>. Cursed be their fury, because it was stubborn:  and their wrath, because it was cruel:  I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel.<br/>

<br/>
A lion's whelp, etc. . .This blessing of Juda foretelleth the strength of his tribe, the fertility of his inheritance; and principally that the sceptre and legislative power should not be utterly taken away from his race till about the time of the coming of Christ:  as in effect it never was:  which is a demonstration against the modern Jews, that the Messiah is long since come; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken away from Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1580">49:10</span>. The sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of nations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1581">49:11</span>. Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass, O my son, to the vine.  He shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1586">49:16</span>. Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Dan shall judge, etc. . .This was verified in Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan, and began to deliver Israel.  Judges 13.5.  But as this deliverance was but temporal and very imperfect, the holy patriarch (ver. 18) aspires after another kind of deliverer, saying:  I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1587">49:17</span>. Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse's heels, that his rider may fall backward.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1589">49:19</span>. Gad, being girded, shall fight before him:  and he himself shall be girded backward.<br/>
<br/>
Gad being girded, etc. . .It seems to allude to the tribe of Gad; when after they had received for their lot the land of Galaad, they marched in arms before the rest of the Israelites, to the conquest of the land of Chanaan:  from whence they afterwards returned loaded with spoils. See Jos. 4. and 12.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1593">49:23</span>. But they that held darts, provoked him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1594">49:24</span>. His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob:  thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
His bow rested upon the strong, etc. . .That is, upon God, who was his strength:  who also loosed his bands, and brought him out of prison to be the pastor, that is, the feeder and ruler of Egypt, and the stone, that is, the rock and support of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1595">49:25</span>. The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1596">49:26</span>. The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers:  until the desire of the everlasting hills should come: may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
The blessings of thy father, etc. . .That is, thy father's blessings are made more prevalent and effectual in thy regard, by the additional strength they receive from his inheriting the blessings of his progenitors Abraham and Isaac.  The desire of the everlasting hills, etc. . .These blessings all looked forward towards Christ, called the desire of the everlasting hills, as being longed for, as it were, by the whole creation.  Mystically, the patriarchs and prophets are called the everlasting hills, by reason of the eminence of their wisdom and holiness.  The Nazarite. . .This word signifies one separated; and agrees to Joseph, as being separated from, and more eminent than, his brethren.  As the ancient Nazarites were so called from their being set aside for God, and vowed to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1597">49:27</span>. Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1598">49:28</span>. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel:  these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one with their proper blessings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1599">49:29</span>. And he charged them, saying:  I am now going to be gathered to my people:  bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,<br/>
<br/>
To be gathered to my people. . .That is, I am going to die, and so to follow my ancestors that are gone before me, and to join their company in another world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1600">49:30</span>. Over against Mambre, in the land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought together with the field, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession to bury in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1601">49:31</span>. There they buried him, and Sara his wife:  there was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife:  there also Lia doth lie buried.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1602">49:32</span>. And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died:  and he was gathered to his people.</p>

<p><b>Genesis Chapter 50<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1604"/>
</b><br/>
The mourning for Jacob, and his interment.  Joseph's kindness towards his brethren.  His death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1605">50:1</span>. And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1606">50:2</span>. And he commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1607">50:3</span>. And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days:  for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1608">50:4</span>. And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao:  If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharao:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1609">50:5</span>. For my father made me swear to him, saying:  Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan.  So I will go up and bury my father, and return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1610">50:6</span>. And Pharao said to him:  Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1611">50:7</span>. So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1612">50:8</span>. And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1613">50:9</span>. He had also in his train chariots and horsemen:  and it was a great company.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1614">50:10</span>. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan:  where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1615">50:11</span>. And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said:  This is a great mourning to the Egyptians.  And therefore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1616">50:12</span>. So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1617">50:13</span>. And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave, which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place, of Ehpron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1618">50:14</span>. And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1619">50:15</span>. Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another:  Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1620">50:16</span>. And they sent a message to him, saying:  Thy father commanded us before he died,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1621">50:17</span>. That we should say thus much to thee from him:  I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practised against thee:  we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness.  And when Joseph heard this, he wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1622">50:18</span>. And his brethren came to him; and worshipping prostrate on the ground, they said:  We are thy servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1623">50:19</span>. And he answered them:  Fear not:  can we resist the will of God?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1624">50:20</span>. You thought evil against me:  but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1625">50:21</span>. Fear not:  I will feed you and your children.  And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1626">50:22</span>. And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house; and lived a hundred and ten years.  And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation.  The children also of Machir, the sons of Manasses, were born on Joseph's knees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1627">50:23</span>. After which he told his brethren:  God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1628">50:24</span>. And he made them swear to him, saying:  God will visit you, carry my bones with you out of this place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1629">50:25</span>. And he died, being a hundred and ten years old.  And being embalmed, he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
