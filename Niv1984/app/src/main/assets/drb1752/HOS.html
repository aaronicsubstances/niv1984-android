<p>THE PROPHECY OF OSEE<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
OSEE, or Hosea, whose name signifies A saviour, was the first in the order of time among those who are commonly called lesser prophets, because their prophecies are short.  He prophesied in the kingdom of Israel, that is, of the ten tribes, about the same time that Isaias prophesied in the kingdom of
Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Osee Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
By marrying a harlot, and by the names of his children, the prophet sets forth the crimes of Israel and their punishment.  He foretells their redemption by Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The word of the Lord, that came to Osee, the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osee:  and the Lord said to Osee:  Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications:  for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
A wife of fornications. . .That is, a wife that has been given to fornication.  This was to represent the Lord's proceedings with his people Israel, who, by spiritual fornication, were continually offending him.--Ibid.  Children of fornications. . .So called from the character of their mother, if not also from their own wicked dispositions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Debelaim:  and she conceived, and bore him a son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And the Lord said to him:  Call his name Jezrahel:  for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy:  for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.<br/>
<br/>
Without mercy. . .Lo-Ruhamah.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord, their God:  and I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And she weaned her that was called Without mercy.  And she conceived, and bore a son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And he said:  Call his name, Not my people:  for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.<br/>
<br/>
Not my people. . .Lo-ammi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered.  And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them:  You are not my people:  it shall be said to them:  Ye are the sons of the living God.<br/>
<br/>
The number, etc. . .Viz., of the true Israelites, the children of the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel, shall be gathered together:  and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land:  for great is the day of Jezrahel.<br/>
<br/>
One head. . .viz., Christ.--Ibid.  Great is the day of Jezrahel. . .That is, of the seed of God; for Jezrahel signifies the seed of God.<br/>

<p><b>Osee Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-14"/>
</b><br/>
Israel is justly punished for leaving God.  The abundance of grace in the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">2:1</span>. Say ye to your brethren:  You are my people:  and to your sister: Thou hast obtained mercy.<br/>
<br/>
Say to your brethren, etc. . .or, Call your brethren, My people:  and your sister, Her that hath obtained mercy.  This is connected with the latter end of the foregoing chapter, and relates to the converts of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">2:2</span>. Judge your mother, judge her:  because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband.  Let her put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother. . .The synagogue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">2:3</span>. Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born:  and I will make her as a wilderness, and will set her as a land that none can pass through and will kill her with drought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">2:4</span>. And I will not have mercy on her children.  for they are the children of fornications.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">2:5</span>. For their mother hath committed fornication, she that conceived them is covered with shame:  for she said:  I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:6</span>. Wherefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:7</span>. And she shall follow after her lovers, and shall not overtake them:  and she shall seek them, and shall not find, and she shall say:  I will go, and return to my first husband:  because it was better with me then than now.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:8</span>. And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver, and gold, which they have used in the service of Baal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:9</span>. Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its season, and I will set at liberty my wool, and my flax, which covered her disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:10</span>. And now I will lay open her folly in the eyes of her lovers:  and no man shall deliver her out of my hand:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:11</span>. And I will cause all her mirth to cease, her solemnities, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festival times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:12</span>. And I will destroy her vines, and her fig trees, of which she said:  These are my rewards, which my lovers have given me:  and I will make her as a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:13</span>. And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, to whom she burnt incense, and decked herself out with her earrings, and with her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:14</span>. Therefore, behold I will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness:  and I will speak to her heart.<br/>
<br/>
I will allure her, etc. . .After all her disloyalties, I will still allure her by my grace etc., and send her vinedressers, viz., the apostles:  originally her own children, who shall open to her the gates of hope; as heretofore at her coming into the land of promise, she had all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the execution of Achan in the valley of Achor.  Jos. 7.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:15</span>. And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place, and the valley of Achor for an opening of hope:  and she shall sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:16</span>. And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord:  That she shall call me:  My husband, and she shall call me no more Banli.<br/>
<br/>
My husband. . .In Hebrew, Ishi.  Baali, my lord.  The meaning of this verse is:  that whereas Ishi and Baali were used indifferently in those days by wives speaking to their husbands; the synagogue, whom God was pleased to consider as his spouse, should call him only Ishi, and abstain from the name of Baali, because of its affinity with the idol Baal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:17</span>. And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and she shall no more remember their name.<br/>
<br/>
Baalim. . .It is the plural number of Baal:  for there were divers idols of Baal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:18</span>. And in that day I will make a covenant with them, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth:  and I will destroy the bow, and the sword, and war out of the land:  and I will make them sleep secure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:19</span>. And I will espouse thee to me for ever:  and I will espouse thee to me in justice, and judgment, and in mercy, and in commiserations.<br/>
<br/>
I will espouse thee, etc. . .This relates to the happy espousals of Christ with his church:  which shall never be dissolved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:20</span>. And I will espouse thee to me in faith:  and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:21</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day:  I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Hear the heavens, etc. . .All shall conspire in favour of the church, which in the following verse is called Jezrahel, that is, the seed of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:22</span>. And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and these shall hear Jezrahel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:23</span>. And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy on her that was without mercy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:24</span>. And I will say to that which is not my people:  Thou art my people:  and they shall say:  Thou art my God.<br/>
<br/>
That which was not my people, etc. . .This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:1</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress:  as the Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the grapes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:2</span>. And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core of barley.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:3</span>. And I said to her:  Thou shalt wait for me many days:  thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt be no man's, and I also will wait for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:4</span>. For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod, and without theraphim.<br/>
<br/>
Theraphim. . .Images or representations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:5</span>. And after this the children of Israel shall return and shall seek the Lord, their God, and David, their king:  and they shall fear the Lord, and his goodness, in the last days.<br/>

God's judgment against the sins of Israel:  Juda is warned not to follow their example.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">4:1</span>. Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land:  for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">4:2</span>. Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery, have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">4:3</span>. Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the heat of the field, and with the fowls of the air:  yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">4:4</span>. But yet let not any man judge:  and let not a man be rebuked:  for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.<br/>

Let not any man judge, etc. . .As if he would say:  It is in vain to strive with them, or reprove them, they are so obstinate in evil.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">4:14</span>.

<br/>
Galgal and Bethaven. . .Places where idols were worshipped.  Bethel, which signifies the house of God, is called by the prophet, Bethaven, that is, the house of vanity, from Jeroboam's golden calf that was worshipped there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">4:16</span>. For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">14:3</span>. Take with you words, and return to the Lord, and say to him:  Take away all iniquity, and receive the good:  and we will render the calves of our lips.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">14:4</span>. Assyria shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more:  The works of our hands are our gods:  for thou wilt have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">14:5</span>. I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely:  for my wrath is turned away from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">14:6</span>. I will be as the dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">14:7</span>. His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree:  and his smell as that of Libanus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">14:8</span>. They shall be converted that sit under his shadow:  they shall live upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine:  his memorial shall be as the wine of Libanus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">14:9</span>. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?  I will hear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree:  from me is thy fruit found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">14:10</span>. Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?  prudent, and he shall know these things?  for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them:  but the transgressors shall fall in them.<br/>
