<p>THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost, the great prophet, (Ecclesiasticus 48.25,) from the greatness of his prophetic spirit, by which he hath foretold so long before, and in so clear a manner, the coming of Christ, the mysteries of our redemption, the calling of the Gentiles, and the glorious establishment, and perpetual flourishing of the church of Christ:  insomuch that he may seem to have been rather an evangelist than a prophet.  His very name is not without mystery; for Isaias in Hebrew signifies the salvation of the Lord, or Jesus is the Lord.  He was, according to the tradition of the Hebrews, of the blood royal of the kings of Juda:  and after a most holy life, ended his days by a glorious martyrdom; being sawed in two, at the command of his wicked son in law, King Manasses, for reproving his evil ways.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Isaias Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The prophet complains of the sins of Juda and Jerusalem, and exhorts them to a sincere conversion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The vision of Isaias the Son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken.  I have brought up children, and exalted them:  but they have despised me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib:  but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children:  they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression?  the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein:  wounds and bruises and swelling sores:  they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire:  your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord?  I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Offer sacrifice no more in vain:  incense is an abomination to me. The new moons, and the sabbaths and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities:  they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you:  and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear:  for your hands are full of blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes, cease to do perversely,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. Learn to do well:  seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord:  if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow:  and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath:  the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot?  justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. Thy silver is turned into dross:  thy wine is mingled with water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves:  they all love bribes, they run after rewards.  They judge not for the fatherless:  and the widow's cause cometh not in to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel:  Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries:  and I will be revenged of my enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dross, and I will take away all thy tin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy counsellors as of old.  After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together:  and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed:  and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark:  and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.<br/>

<p><b>Isaias Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-34"/>
</b><br/>
All nations shall flow to the church of Christ.  The Jews shall be rejected for their sins.  Idolatry shall be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:1</span>. The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:2</span>. And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.<br/>
<br/>
The last days. . .The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the scripture the last days; because no other age or time shall come after it, but only eternity.--Ibid.  On the top of mountains, etc. . .This shews the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ:  for a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:3</span>. And many people shall go, and say:  Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths:  for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:4</span>. And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people:  and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles:  nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:5</span>. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:6</span>. For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob:  because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:7</span>. Their land is filled with silver and gold:  and there is no end of their treasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:8</span>. And their land is filled with horses:  and their chariots are innumerable.  Their land also is full of idols:  they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:9</span>. And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:10</span>. Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:11</span>. The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop:  and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:12</span>. Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:13</span>. And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:14</span>. And upon all the high mountains and upon all the elevated hills.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:15</span>. And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:16</span>. And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:17</span>. And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:18</span>. And idols shall be utterly destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Idols shall be utterly destroyed. . .or utterly pass away.  This was verified by the establishment of Christianity.  And by this and other texts of the like nature, the wild system of some modern sectaries is abundantly confuted, who charge the whole Christian church with worshipping idols, for many ages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:19</span>. And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:20</span>. In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:21</span>. And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:22</span>. Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.<br/>

The confusion and other evils that shall come upon the Jews for their sins.  The pride of their women shall be punished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:1</span>. For behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:2</span>. The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet and the cunning man, and the ancient.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:6</span>. For a man shall take hold of his brother, one of the house of his father, saying:  Thou hast a garment, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:7</span>. In that day he shall answer, saying:  I am no healer, and in my house there is no bread, nor clothing:  make me not ruler of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:8</span>. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen:  because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:9</span>. The shew of their countenance hath answered them:  and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it:  woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:10</span>. Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the fruit of his doings.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:13</span>. The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:14</span>. The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes:  for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:15</span>. Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:16</span>. And the Lord said:  Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set pace:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">6:3</span>. And they cried one to another, and said:  Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory,<br/>

The prophet assures king Achaz that the two kings his enemies shall not take Jerusalem.  A virgin shall conceive and bear a son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">7:1</span>. And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Rasin king of Syria and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail over it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">7:2</span>. And they told the house of David, saying:  Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">7:3</span>. And the Lord said to Isaias:  Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">7:4</span>. And thou shalt say to him:  See thou be quiet:  fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these firebrands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria, and of the son of Romelia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">7:5</span>. Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">7:6</span>. Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">7:7</span>. Thus saith the Lord God:  It shall not stand, and this shall not be.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">7:8</span>. But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rasin:  and within threescore and five years, Ephraim shall cease to be a people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">7:9</span>. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Romelia.  If you will not believe, you shall not continue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">7:10</span>. And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">7:14</span>. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign.  Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son and his name shall be called Emmanuel.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">7:16</span>. For before the child know to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">7:17</span>. The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">7:18</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">7:19</span>. And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">7:20</span>. In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">7:21</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">7:22</span>. And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter:  for butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">7:23</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall become thorns and briers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">7:24</span>. With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither:  for briers and thorns shall be in all the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:25</span>. And as for the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon.<br/>

The prophet will not cease from preaching Christ:  to whom all nations shall be converted:  and whose church shall continue for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1324">62:1</span>. For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not rest till her just one come forth as brightness, and her saviour be lighted as a lamp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1325">62:2</span>. And the Gentiles shall see thy just one, and all kings thy glorious one:  and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1326">62:3</span>. And thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1327">62:4</span>. Thou shalt no more be called Forsaken:  and thy land shall no more be called Desolate:  but thou shalt be called My pleasure in her, and thy land inhabited.  Because the Lord hath been well pleased with thee: and thy land shall be inhabited.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1328">62:5</span>. For the young man shall dwell with the virgin, and thy children shall dwell in thee.  And the bridegroom shall rejoice over the bride, and thy God shall rejoice over thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1329">62:6</span>. Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen all the day, and all the night, they shall never hold their peace.  You that are mindful of the Lord, hold not your peace,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1330">62:7</span>. And give him no silence till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1331">62:8</span>. The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength:  Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thy enemies:  and the sons of the strangers shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1332">62:9</span>. For they that gather it, shall eat it, and shall praise the Lord: and they that bring it together, shall drink it in my holy courts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1333">62:10</span>. Go through, go through the gates, prepare the way for the people, make the road plain, pick out the stones, and lift up the standard to the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1334">62:11</span>. Behold the Lord hath made it to be heard in the ends of the earth, tell the daughter of Sion:  Behold thy Saviour cometh:  behold his reward is with him, and his work before him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1335">62:12</span>. And they shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.  But thou shalt be called:  A city sought after, and not forsaken.<br/>

Christ's victory over his enemies:  his mercies to his people:  their complaint.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1338">63:1</span>. Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra, this beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength.  I, that speak justice, and am a defender to save.<br/>
<br/>
Edom. . .Edom and Bosra (a strong city of Edom) are here taken in a mystical sense for the enemies of Christ and his church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1339">63:2</span>. Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the winepress?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1340">63:3</span>. I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me:  I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1341">63:4</span>. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, the year of my redemption is come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1342">63:5</span>. I looked about, and there was none to help:  I sought, and there was none to give aid:  and my own arm hath saved for me, and my indignation itself hath helped me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1343">63:6</span>. And I have trodden down the people in my wrath, and have made them drunk in my indignation, and have brought down their strength to the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1344">63:7</span>. I will remember the tender mercies of the Lord, the praise of the Lord for all the things that the Lord hath bestowed upon us, and for the multitude of his good things to the house of Israel, which he hath given them according to his kindness, and according to the multitude of his mercies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1345">63:8</span>. And he said:  Surely they are my people, children that will not deny:  so he became their saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1346">63:9</span>. In all their affliction he was not troubled, and the angel of his presence saved them:  in his love, and in his mercy he redeemed them, and he carried them and lifted them up all the days of old.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1347">63:10</span>. But they provoked to wrath, and afflicted the spirit of his Holy One:  and he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1348">63:11</span>. And he remembered the days of old of Moses, and of his people: Where is he that brought them up out of the sea, with the shepherds of his flock?  where is he that put in the midst of them the spirit of his Holy One?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1349">63:12</span>. He that brought out Moses by the right hand, by the arm of his majesty:  that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1350">63:13</span>. He that led them out through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness that stumbleth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1351">63:14</span>. As a beast that goeth down in the field, the spirit of the Lord was their leader:  so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1352">63:15</span>. Look down from heaven, and behold from thy holy habitation and the place of thy glory:  where is thy zeal, and thy strength, the multitude of thy bowels, and of thy mercies?  they have held back themselves from me.<br/>
<br/>
They have held back, etc. . .This is spoken by the prophet in the person of the Jews at the time when, for their sins, they were given up to their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1353">63:16</span>. For thou art our father, and Abraham hath not known us, and Israel hath been ignorant of us:  thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham hath not know us, etc. . .That is, Abraham will not now acknowledge us for his children, by reason of our degeneracy; but thou, O Lord, art our true father and our redeemer, and no other can be called our parent in comparison with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1354">63:17</span>. Why hast thou made us to err, O Lord, from thy ways:  why hast thou hardened our heart, that we should not fear thee?  return for the sake of thy servants, the tribes of thy inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
Made us to err, etc.  Hardened our heart, etc. . .The meaning is, that God in punishment of their great and manifold crimes, and their long abuse of his mercy and grace, had withdrawn his graces from them, and so given them up to error and hardness of heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1355">63:18</span>. They have possessed thy holy people as nothing:  our enemies have trodden down thy sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1356">63:19</span>. We are become as in the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and when we were not called by thy name.<br/>

The prophet prays for the release of his people; and for the remission of their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1359">64:1</span>. O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and wouldst come down:  the mountains would melt away at thy presence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1360">64:2</span>. They would melt as at the burning of fire, the waters would burn with fire, that thy name might be made known to thy enemies:  that the nations might tremble at thy presence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1361">64:3</span>. When thou shalt do wonderful things, we shall not bear them:  thou didst come down, and at thy presence the mountains melted away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1362">64:4</span>. From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears:  the eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1363">64:5</span>. Thou hast met him that rejoiceth, and doth justice:  in thy ways they shall remember thee:  behold thou art angry, and we have sinned:  in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1364">64:6</span>. And we are all become as one unclean, and all our justices as the rag of a menstruous woman:  and we have all fallen as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br/>
<br/>
Our justices, etc. . .That is, the works by which we pretended to make ourselves just.  This is spoken particularly of the sacrifices, sacraments, and ceremonies of the Jews, after the death of Christ, and the promulgation of the new law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1365">64:7</span>. There is none that calleth upon thy name:  that riseth up, and taketh hold of thee:  thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast crushed us in the hand of our iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1366">64:8</span>. And now, O Lord, thou art our father, and we are clay:  and thou art our maker, and we all are the works of thy hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1367">64:9</span>. Be not very angry, O Lord, and remember no longer our iniquity: behold, see we are all thy people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1368">64:10</span>. The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is made a desert, Jerusalem is desolate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1369">64:11</span>. The house of our holiness, and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt with fire, and all our lovely things are turned into ruins.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1374">65:2</span>. I have spread forth my hands all the day to an unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not good after their own thoughts.<br/>
