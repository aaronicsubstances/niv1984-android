<p>THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
Jeremias was a priest, a native of Anathoth, a priestly city in the tribe of Benjamin:  and was sanctified from his mother's womb, to be a prophet of God; which office he began to execute when he was yet a child in age.  He was in his whole life, according to the signification of his name, Great before the Lord; and a special figure of Jesus Christ, in the persecutions he underwent for discharging his duty; in his charity for his persecutors; and in the violent death he suffered at their hands:  it being an ancient tradition of the Hebrews, that he was stoned to death by the remnant of the Jews who had retired into
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Jeremias Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The time, and the calling, of Jeremias:  his prophetical visions.  God encourages him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The words of Jeremias the son of Helcias, of the priests that were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. The word of the Lord which came to him in the days of Josias the son of Amon king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And which came to him in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda, even unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew thee:  and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and made thee a prophet unto the nations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And I said:  Ah, ah, ah, Lord God:  behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Say not:  I am a child:  for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee:  and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Be not afraid at their presence:  for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth:  and the Lord said to me:  Behold I have given my words in thy mouth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Lo, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  What seest thou, Jeremias?  And I said:  I see a rod watching.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And the Lord said to me:  Thou hast seen well:  for I will watch over my word to perform it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me a second time saying:  What seest thou?  And I said:  I see a boiling caldron, and the face thereof from the face of the north.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And the Lord said to me:  From the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord:  and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And I will pronounce my judgments against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee.  Be not afraid at their presence:  for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And they shall fight against them, and shall not prevail:  for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-22"/>
</b><br/>
God expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude and infidelity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:1</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:2</span>. Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying:  Thus saith the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in the desert, in a land that is not sown.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:3</span>. Israel is holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his increase:  all they that devour him offend:  evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:4</span>. Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:5</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:6</span>. And they have not said:  Where is the Lord, that made us come up out of the land of Egypt?  that led us through the desert, through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of drought, and the image of death, through a land wherein no man walked, nor any man dwelt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:7</span>. And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the fruit thereof, and the best things thereof:  and when ye entered in, you defiled my land and made my inheritance an abomination.<br/>
<br/>
Carmel. . .That is, a fruitful, plentiful land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:8</span>. The priests did not say:  Where is the Lord?  and they that held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me:  and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed idols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:9</span>. Therefore will I yet contend in judgment with you, saith the Lord, and I will plead with your children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:10</span>. Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see:  and send into Cedar, and consider diligently:  and see if there hath been done any thing like this.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:11</span>. If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are not gods:  but my people have changed their glory into an idol.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:12</span>. Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:13</span>. For my people have done two evils.  They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:14</span>. Is Israel a bondman, or a homeborn slave?  why then is he become a prey?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:15</span>. The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise, they have made his land a wilderness:  his cities are burnt down, and there is none to dwell in them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:16</span>. The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have defloured thee, even to the crown of the head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:17</span>. Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the way?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:18</span>. And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water?  And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:19</span>. Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee.  Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord the God of hosts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:20</span>. Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst:  I will not serve.  For on every high hill, and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:21</span>. Yet, I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed:  how then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O strange vineyard?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:22</span>. Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before me, saith the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
Borith. . .An herb used to clean clothes, and take out spots and dirt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:23</span>. How canst thou say:  I am not polluted, I have not walked after Baalim?  see thy ways in the valley, know what thou hast done:  as a swift runner pursuing his course.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:24</span>. A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love:  none shall turn her away:  all that seek her shall not fail:  in her monthly filth they shall find her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:25</span>. Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst.  But thou saidst:  I have lost all hope, I will not do it:  for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:26</span>. As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes and their priests, and their prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:27</span>. Saying to a stock:  Thou art my father:  and to a stone:  Thou hast begotten me:  they have turned their back to me, and not their face:  and in the time of their affliction they will say:  Arise, and deliver us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:28</span>. Where are the gods, whom thou hast made thee?  let them arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction:  for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:29</span>. Why will you contend with me in judgment?  you have all forsaken me, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:30</span>. In vain have I struck your children, they have not received correction:  your sword hath devoured your prophets, your generation is like a ravaging lion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:31</span>. See ye the word of the Lord:  Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a lateward springing land?  why then have my people said:  We are revolted, we will come to thee no more?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:32</span>. Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her stomacher?  but my people hath forgotten me days without number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:33</span>. Why dost thou endeavour to shew thy way good to seek my love, thou who hast also taught thy malices to be thy ways,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:34</span>. And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and innocent?  not in ditches have I found them, but in all places, which I mentioned before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:35</span>. And thou hast said:  I am without sin and am innocent:  and therefore let thy anger be turned away from me.  Behold, I will contend with thee in judgment, because thou hast said:  I have not sinned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:36</span>. How exceeding base art thou become, going the same ways over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">2:37</span>. For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon thy head:  for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt have nothing prosperous therein.<br/>

God invites the rebel Jews to return to him, with a promise to receive them:  he foretells the conversion of the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:1</span>. It is commonly said:  If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and marry another man, shall he return to her any more?  shall not that woman be polluted, and defiled?  but thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers:  nevertheless return to me, saith the Lord, and I will receive thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:2</span>. Lift up thy eyes on high:  and see where thou hast not prostituted thyself:  thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them as a robber in the wilderness:  and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications, and with thy wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:3</span>. Therefore the showers were withholden, and there was no lateward rain:  thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not blush.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:4</span>. Therefore at the least from this time call to me:  Thou art my father, the guide of my virginity:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:5</span>. Wilt thou be angry for ever, or wilt thou continue unto the end? Behold, thou hast spoken, and hast done evil things, and hast been able.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:6</span>. And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias:  Hast thou seen what rebellious Israel hath done?  she hath gone of herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:7</span>. And when she had done all these things, I said:  Return to me, and she did not return.  And her treacherous sister Juda saw,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:8</span>. That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce:  yet her treacherous sister Juda was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:9</span>. And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land, and played the harlot with stones and with stocks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:10</span>. And after all this, her treacherous sister Juda hath not returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:11</span>. And the Lord said to me:  The rebellious Israel hath justified her soul, in comparison of the treacherous Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:12</span>. Go, and proclaim these words towards the north, and thou shalt say:  Return, O rebellious Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not turn away my face from you:  for I am holy, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:13</span>. But yet acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God:  and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my voice, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:14</span>. Return, O ye revolting children, saith the Lord:  for I am your I husband:  and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a kindred, and will bring you into Sion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:15</span>. And I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:16</span>. And when you shall be multiplied, and increase in the land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more:  The ark of the covenant of the Lord:  neither shall it come upon the heart, neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited, neither shall that be done any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:17</span>. At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the name of the Lord to Jerusalem, and they shall not walk after the perversity of their most wicked heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:18</span>. In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land which I gave to your fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">3:19</span>. But I said:  How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the Gentiles?  And I said:  Thou shalt call me father and shalt not cease to walk after me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:20</span>. But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">3:21</span>. A voice was heard in the highways, weeping and howling of the children of Israel:  because they have made their way wicked, they have forgotten the Lord their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">3:22</span>. Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your rebellions. Behold we come to thee:  for thou art the Lord our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">3:23</span>. In very deed the hills were liars, and the multitude of the mountains:  truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">3:24</span>. Confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">3:25</span>. We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall cover us, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth even to this day, and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:29</span>. At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away:  they have entered into thickets and climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.<br/>

But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do?  though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain:  thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">4:31</span>. For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail, anguishes as of a woman in labour of a child.  The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands:  Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.<br/>

The judgments of God shall fall upon the Jews for their manifold sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">5:1</span>. Go about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man that executeth judgment, and seeketh faith:  and I will be merciful unto it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">5:2</span>. And though they say:  The Lord liveth; this also they will swear falsely.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:3</span>. O Lord, thy eyes are upon truth:  thou hast struck them, and they have not grieved:  thou hast bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction:  they have made their faces harder than the rock, and they have refused to return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:4</span>. But I said:  Perhaps these are poor and foolish, that know not the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:5</span>. I will go therefore to the great men, and will speak to them:  for they have known the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God:  and behold these have altogether broken the yoke more, and have burst the bonds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:6</span>. Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their cities:  every one that shall go out thence shall be taken, because their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are strengthened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:7</span>. How can I be merciful to thee?  thy children have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not gods:  I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and rioted in the harlot's house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:8</span>. They are become as amorous horses and stallions:  every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:9</span>. Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord?  and shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:10</span>. Scale the walls thereof, and throw them down, but do not utterly destroy:  take away the branches thereof, because they are not the Lord's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:11</span>. For the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have greatly transgressed against me, saith the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">5:20</span>. Declare ye this to the house of Jacob, and publish it in Juda, saying:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">5:21</span>. Hear, O foolish people, and without understanding:  who have eyes, and see not:  and ears, and hear not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:22</span>. Will not you then fear me, saith the Lord:  and will you not repent at my presence?  I have set the sand a bound for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over:  and the waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail:  they shall swell, and shall not pass over it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">5:23</span>. But the heart of this people is become hard of belief and provoking, they are revolted and gone away.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">5:24</span>. And they have not said in their heart:  Let us fear the Lord our God, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season:  who preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">5:25</span>. Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your sins have withholden good things from you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">5:26</span>. For among my people are found wicked men, that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">5:27</span>. As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit: therefore are they become great and enriched.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">5:28</span>. They are grown gross and fat:  and have most wickedly transgressed my words.  They have not judged the cause of the widow, they have not managed the cause of the fatherless, and they have not judged the judgment of the poor.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">5:29</span>. Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord?  or shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:1</span>. Strengthen yourselves, ye sons of Benjamin, in the midst of Jerusalem, and sound the trumpet in Thecua, and set up the standard over Bethacarem:  for evil is seen out of the north, and a great destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:2</span>. I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate woman.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">6:10</span>. To whom shall I speak?  and to whom shall I testify, that he may hear?  behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: behold the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach:  and they will not receive it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">6:11</span>. Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with holding in:  pour it out upon the child abroad, and upon the council of the young men together:  for man and woman shall be taken, the ancient and he that is full of days.<br/>
<br/>

For their obstinacy in sin the Jews shall be led captive.  He is cursed that trusteth in flesh.  God alone searcheth the heart, giving to every one as he deserves.  The prophet prayeth to be delivered from his enemies, and preacheth up the observance of the sabbath.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">18:12</span>. And they said; We have no hopes:  for we will go after our own thoughts, and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his evil heart.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">19:9</span>. And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters:  and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.<br/>

The prophet is persecuted:  he denounces captivity to his persecutors, and bemoans himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">20:1</span>. Now Phassur the son of Emmer, the priest, who was appointed chief in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">20:2</span>. And Phassur struck Jeremias the prophet, and put him in the stocks, that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">20:3</span>. And when it was light the next day, Phassur brought Jeremias out of the stocks.  And Jeremias said to him:  The Lord hath not called thy name Phassur, but fear on every side.<br/>
<br/>
Phassur. . .This name signifies increase and principality:  and therefore is here changed to Magor-Missabib, or fear on every side:  to denote the evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">20:4</span>.

<br/>
Thou hast deceived, etc. . .The meaning of the prophet, is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">20:8</span>. For I am speaking now this long time, crying out against iniquity, and I often proclaim devastation:  and the word of the Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the day.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">20:12</span>. And thou, O Lord of hosts, prover of the just, who seest the reins and the heart:  let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">21:5</span>. And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">21:6</span>. And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, men and beasts shall die of a great pestilence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">21:7</span>. And after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, and the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword, and he shall not be moved to pity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">21:8</span>. And to this people thou shalt say:  Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-544">21:9</span>. He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:  but he that shall go out and flee over to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and his life shall be to him as a spoil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-545">21:10</span>. For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord:  it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">21:11</span>. And to the house of the king of Juda:  Hear ye the word of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-547">21:12</span>. O house of David, thus saith the Lord:  Judge ye judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand of the oppressor:  lest my indignation go forth like a fire, and be kindled, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-548">21:13</span>. Behold I come to thee that dwellest in a valley upon a rock above a plain, saith the Lord:  and you say:  Who shall strike us and who shall enter into our houses?<br/>
<br/>
To thee that dwellest, etc. . .He speaks to Jerusalem, confiding in the strength of her situation upon rocks, surrounded with a deep valley.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-549">21:14</span>. But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the Lord:  and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof:  and it shall devour all things round about it.<br/>

An exhortation both to king and people to return of God.  The sentence of God upon Joachaz, Joakim, and Jechonias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-552">22:1</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Go down to the house of the king of Juda, and there thou shalt speak this word,<br/>
<br/>
Go down, etc. . .The contents of this chapter are of a more ancient date than those of the foregoing chapter:  for the order of time is not always observed in the writings of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-553">22:2</span>. And thou shalt say:  Hear the word of the Lord, king of Juda, that sittest upon the throne of David:  thou and thy servants, and thy people, who enter in by these gates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-554">22:3</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Execute judgment and justice, and deliver him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor:  and afflict not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, nor oppress them unjustly: and shed not innocent blood in this place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-555">22:4</span>. For if you will do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house, kings of the race of David sitting upon his throne, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants, and their people.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-556">22:5</span>. But if you will not hearken to these words:  I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation.<br/>

<br/>
Galaad the head of Libanus. . .By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David: by Libanus, a high mountain abounding in cedar trees, the populous city of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-558">22:7</span>. And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars, and shall cast them headlong into the fire.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare. . .Literally, sanctify.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-559">22:8</span>. And many nations shall pass by this city:  and they shall say every man to his neighbour:  Why hath the Lord done so to this great city?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">22:9</span>. And they shall answer:  Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and have adored strange gods, and served them.<br/>

Weep not for him that is dead, etc. . .He means the good king Josias, who by death was taken away, so as not to see the miseries of his country.--Ibid.  Him that goeth away. . .Viz., sellum, alias Joachaz, who was carried captive into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-562">22:11</span>. For thus saith the Lord to Sellum the son of Josias the king of Juda, who reigned instead of his father, who went forth out of this place:  He shall return hither no more:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-563">22:12</span>. But in the place, to which I have removed him, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-564">22:13</span>. Woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice, and his chambers not in judgment:  that will oppress his friend without cause, and will not pay him his wages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-565">22:14</span>. Who saith:  I will build me a wide house, and large chambers:  who openeth to himself windows, and maketh roofs of cedar, and painteth them with vermilion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-566">22:15</span>. Shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and it was then well with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">22:16</span>. He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good:  was it not therefore because he knew me, saith the Lord?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-570">22:19</span>. He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, rotten and cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">22:21</span>. I spoke to thee in thy prosperity:  and thou saidst:  I will not hear:  this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou hast not heard my voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-573">22:22</span>. The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy wickedness.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-574">22:23</span>. Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the cedars, how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee, as the pains of a woman in labour?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-575">22:24</span>. As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda were a ring on my right hand, I would pluck him thence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-576">22:25</span>. And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.<br/>

Write this man barren. . .That is, childless:  not that he had no children, but that his children should never sit on the throne of Juda.<br/>

Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the pastors that feed my people:  You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them:  behold I will visit upon you for the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
Out of my presence. . .That is, the Lord declares that out of his presence he will cast them, and bring them to captivity for their transgressions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">23:40</span>. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten.<br/>

<br/>
The dove. . .This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, it is said, was a dove.  But the Hebrew word Jonah, which is here rendered a dove, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove's flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them.<br/>

The prophet is apprehended and accused by the priests:  but discharged by the princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">26:1</span>. In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, came this word from the Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">26:2</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  stand in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Juda, out of which they come, to adore in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have commanded thee to speak unto them:  leave not out one word.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">26:3</span>. If so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil that I think to do unto them for the wickedness of their doings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">26:4</span>. And thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord:  If you will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">26:5</span>. To give ear to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent to you rising up early:  and sending, and you have not hearkened:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">26:6</span>. I will make this house like Silo:  and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">26:7</span>. And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">26:8</span>. And when Jeremias had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, and the prophets, and all the people laid hold on him, saying:  Let him be put to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">26:9</span>. Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying:  This house shall be like Silo; and this city shall be made desolate, without an inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered together against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">26:10</span>. And the princes of Juda heard these words:  and they went up from the king's house into the house of the Lord, and sat in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">26:11</span>. And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying:  The judgment of death is for this man:  because he hath prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">26:12</span>. Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying:  The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house, and concerning this city all the words that you have heard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">26:13</span>. Now therefore amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God:  and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath spoken against you.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">26:17</span>. And some of the ancients of the land rose up:  and they spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">26:18</span>. Micheas of Morasthi was a prophet in the days of Ezechias king of Juda, and he spoke to all the people of Juda, saying:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall be a heap of stones:  and the mountain of the house the high places of woods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">26:19</span>. Did Ezechias king of Juda, and all Juda, condemn him to death? did they not fear the Lord, and beseech the face of the Lord:  and the Lord repented of the evil that he had spoken against them?  therefore we are doing a great evil against our souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">26:20</span>. There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim:  and he prophesied against this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">26:21</span>. And Joakim, and all his men in power, and his princes heard these words:  and the king sought to put him to death.  And Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">26:22</span>. And king Joakim sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achobor, and men with him into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">26:23</span>. And they brought Urias out of Egypt:  and brought him to king Joakim, and he slew him with the sword:  and he cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">26:24</span>. So the hand of Ahicam the son of Saphan was with Jeremias, that he should not be delivered into the hands of the people, to put him to death.<br/>

Joakim. . .This revelation was made to the prophet in the beginning of the reign of Joakim:  but the bands were not sent to the princes here named before the reign of Sedecias, ver. 3.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">27:2</span>. Thus saith the Lord to me:  Make thee bands, and chains:  and thou shalt put them on thy neck.<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 29<br id="bookmark-drb1752-746"/>
</b><br/>
Jeremias writeth to the captives in Babylon, exhorting them to be easy there, and not to hearken to false prophets.  That they shall be delivered after seventy years.  But those that remain in Jerusalem shall perish by the sword, famine, and pestilence.  And that Achab, Sedecias, and Semeias, false prophets, shall die miserably.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">29:1</span>. Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that were carried into captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">29:2</span>. After that Jechonias the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Juda, and of Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the engravers were departed out of Jerusalem:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">29:3</span>. By the hand of Elasa the son of Saphan, and Gamarias the son of Helcias, whom Sedecias king of Juda sent to Babylon to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">29:4</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">29:5</span>. Build ye houses, and dwell in them:  and plant orchards, and eat the fruit of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-752">29:6</span>. Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters:  and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and let them bear sons and daughters:  and be ye multiplied there, and be not few in number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-753">29:7</span>. And seek the peace of the city, to which I have caused you to be carried away captives; and pray to the Lord for it:  for in the peace thereof shall be your peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">29:8</span>. For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners deceive you: and give no heed to your dreams which you dream:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">29:9</span>. For they prophesy falsely to you in my name:  and I have not sent them, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">29:10</span>. For thus saith the Lord:  When the seventy years shall begin to be accomplished in Babylon, I will visit you:  and I will perform my good word in your favour, to bring you again to this place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">29:11</span>. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an end and patience.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">29:12</span>. And you shall call upon me, and you shall go.  and you shall pray to me, and I will hear you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">29:13</span>. You shall seek me, and shall find me:  when you shall seek me with all your heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">29:14</span>. And I will be found by you, saith the Lord:  and I will bring back your captivity, and I will gather you out of all nations, and from all the places to which I have driven you out, saith the Lord:  and I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried away captive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">29:15</span>. Because you have said:  The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">29:16</span>. For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and to all the people that dwell in this city, to your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-763">29:17</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Behold I will send upon them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence:  and I will make them like bad figs that cannot be eaten, because they are very bad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-764">29:18</span>. And I will persecute them with the sword, and with famine, and with the pestilence:  and I will give them up unto affliction to all the kingdoms of the earth:  to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach to all the nations to which I have driven them out:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-765">29:19</span>. Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord: which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising by night, and sending:  and you have not heard, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-766">29:20</span>. Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent out from Jerusalem to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-767">29:21</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to Achab the son of Colias, and to Sedecias the son of Maasias, who prophesy unto you in my name falsely:  Behold I will deliver them up into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon:  and he shall kill them before your eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-768">29:22</span>. And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Juda, that are in Babylon, saying:  The Lord make thee like Sedecias, and like Achab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-769">29:23</span>. Because they have acted folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their friends, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I commanded them not:  I am the judge and the witness, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-770">29:24</span>. And to Semeias the Nehelamite thou shalt say:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-771">29:25</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in Jerusalem, and to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest, and to all the priests, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-772">29:26</span>. The Lord hath made thee priest instead of Joiada the priest, that thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the Lord, over every man that raveth and prophesieth, to put him in the stocks, and into prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-773">29:27</span>. And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias the Anathothite, who prophesieth to you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-774">29:28</span>. For he hath also sent to us in Babylon, saying:  It is a long time:  build ye houses, and dwell in them:  and plant gardens, and eat the fruits of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-775">29:29</span>. So Sophonias the priest read this letter, in the hearing of Jeremias the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-776">29:30</span>. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-777">29:31</span>. Send to all them of the captivity, saying:  Thus saith the Lord to Semeias the Nehelamite:  Because Semeias hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not:  and hath caused you to trust in a lie:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-778">29:32</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord:  behold I will visit upon Semeias the Nehelamite, and upon his seed:  he shall not have a man to sit in the midst of this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, saith the Lord:  because he hath spoken treason against the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">32:1</span>. The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth year of Sedecias king of Juda:  the same is the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">32:2</span>. At that time the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the house of the king of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">32:3</span>. For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up, saying:  Why dost thou prophesy, saying:  Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">32:4</span>. And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans:  but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon:  and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">32:5</span>. And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon:  and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the Lord.  But if you will fight against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">32:6</span>. And Jeremias said:  The word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">32:7</span>. Behold, Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come to thee, saying:  Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to buy it, being next akin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">32:8</span>. And Hanameel my uncle's son came to me, according to the word of the Lord, to the entry of the prison, and said to me:  Buy my field, which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:  for the right of inheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it.  And I understood that this was the word of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">32:9</span>. And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that is in Anathoth:  and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">32:10</span>. And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took witnesses:  and I weighed him the money in the balances.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-859">32:11</span>. And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifications with the seals that were on the outside.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-860">32:12</span>. And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neri the son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, and before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">32:13</span>. And I charged Baruch before them, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">32:14</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Take these writings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and this deed that is open:  and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">32:15</span>. For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">32:16</span>. And after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">32:17</span>. Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm:  no word shall be hard to thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-866">32:18</span>. Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them:  O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-867">32:19</span>. Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought:  whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">32:20</span>. Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even until this day, and in Israel, and amongst men, and hast made thee a name as at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">32:21</span>. And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm, and with great terror.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">32:22</span>. And hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">32:23</span>. And they came in, and possessed it:  but they obeyed not thy voice, and they walked not in thy law:  and they did not any of those things that thou didst command them to do, and all these evils are come upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">32:24</span>. Behold works are built up against the city to take it:  and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence:  and what thou hast spoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself seest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">32:25</span>. And sayest thou to me, O Lord God:  Buy a field for money, and take witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-874">32:26</span>. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-875">32:27</span>. Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh:  shall any thing be hard for me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-876">32:28</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-877">32:29</span>. And the Chaldeans that fight against this city, shall come and set it on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they offered sacrifice to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-878">32:30</span>. For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda, have continually done evil in my eyes from their youth:  the children of Israel who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">32:31</span>. For this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from the day that they built it, until this day, in which it shall be taken out of my sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-880">32:32</span>. Because of all the evil of the children of Israel, and of the children of Juda, which they have done, provoking me to wrath, they and their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-881">32:33</span>. And they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces: when I taught them early in the morning, and instructed them, and they would not hearken to receive instruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">32:34</span>. And they have set their idols in the house, in which my name is called upon, to defile it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">32:35</span>. And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to consecrate their sons and their daughters to Moloch:  which I commanded them not, neither entered it into my heart, that they should do this abomination, and cause Juda to sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">32:36</span>. And now, therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to this city, whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">32:37</span>. Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands to which I have cast them out in my anger, and in my wrath, and in my great indignation:  and I will bring them again into this place, and will cause them to dwell securely.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">32:38</span>. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">32:39</span>. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me all days:  and that it may be well with them, and with their children after them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-888">32:40</span>. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and will not cease to do them good:  and I will give my fear in their heart, that they may not revolt from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-889">32:41</span>. And I will rejoice over them, when I shall do them good:  and I will plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart, and with all my soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-890">32:42</span>. For thus saith the Lord:  As I have brought upon this people all this great evil:  so will I bring upon them all the good that I now speak to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-891">32:43</span>. And fields shall be purchased in this land:  whereof you say that it is desolate, because there remaineth neither man nor beast, and it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-892">32:44</span>. Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be written, and sealed, and witnesses shall be taken, in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, in the cities of Juda, and in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are towards the south:  for I will bring back their captivity, saith the Lord.<br/>

The prayer of peace. . .That is, the peace and welfare which they pray for.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-904">33:10</span>.

The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth, that were under the power of his hand, and all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof, saying:<br/>

And thou shalt not escape out of his hand:  but thou shalt surely be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand:  and thy eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.<br/>

Die in peace. . .That is, by a natural death.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-933">34:11</span>. But afterwards they turned:  and brought back again their servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as menservants and maidservants.<br/>

At the end of seven years, let ye go every man his brother being a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee:  and your fathers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their ear.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-950">35:4</span>. And I brought them into the house of the Lord, to the treasure house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the man of God, which was by the treasure house of the princes, above the treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-951">35:5</span>. And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups:  and I said to them:  Drink ye wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-952">35:6</span>. And they answered :  We will not drink wine:  because Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying:  You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for ever:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-953">35:7</span>. Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow reed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any:  but you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-954">35:8</span>. Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us:  so as to drink no wine all our days:  neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-955">35:9</span>. Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or field, or seed:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-956">35:10</span>. But we have dwelt in tents, and have been obedient according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-957">35:11</span>. But when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up to our land, we said:  Come, let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of Syria:  and we have remained in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-958">35:12</span>. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-959">35:13</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:  Will you not receive instruction, to obey my words, saith the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-960">35:14</span>. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, by which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed:  and they have drunk none to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their father:  but I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you have not obeyed me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-961">35:15</span>. And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending and saying:  Return ye every man from his wicked way, and make your ways good:  and follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land, which I gave you and your fathers:  and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-962">35:16</span>. So the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have constantly kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them:  but this people hath not obeyed me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-963">35:17</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Behold I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard:  I have called to them, and they have not answered me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">35:18</span>. And Jeremias said to the house of the Rechabites:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done all that he commanded you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">35:19</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  There shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab the son of Rechab, standing before me for ever.<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 36<br id="bookmark-drb1752-967"/>
</b><br/>
Jeremias sends Baruch to read his prophecies in the temple; the book is brought to king Joakim, who burns it.  The prophet denounces his judgment, and causes Baruch to write a new copy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">36:1</span>. And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, that this word came to Jeremias by the Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">36:2</span>. Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda, and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from the days of Josias even to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">36:3</span>. If so be, when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his wicked way:  and I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">36:4</span>. So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias:  and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">36:5</span>. And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying:  I am shut up, and cannot go into the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up. . .Not that the prophet was now in prison; for the contrary appears from ver. 19, but that he kept himself shut up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with.  See chap. 26.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">36:6</span>. Go thou in therefore, and read out of the volume, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people in the house of the Lord on the fasting day:  and also thou shalt read them in the hearing of all Juda that come out of their cities:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-974">36:7</span>. If so be they may present their supplication before the Lord, and may return every one from his wicked way:  for great is the wrath and indignation which the Lord hath pronounced against this people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">36:8</span>. And Baruch the son of Nerias did according to all that Jeremias the prophet ,had commanded him, reading out of the volume the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-976">36:9</span>. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that were come together out of the cities of Juda to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-977">36:10</span>. And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-978">36:11</span>. And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">36:12</span>. He went down into the king's house to the secretary's chamber: and behold all the princes sat there, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias, and all the princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">36:13</span>. And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read out of the volume in the hearing of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">36:14</span>. Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, to Baruch, saying:  Take in thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, and come.  So Baruch the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand, and came to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-982">36:15</span>. And they said to him:  Sit down and read these things in our hearing.  And Baruch read in their hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-983">36:16</span>. And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon one another with astonishment, and they said to Baruch:  We must tell the king all these words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-984">36:17</span>. And they asked him, saying:  Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-985">36:18</span>. And Baruch said to them:  With his mouth he pronounced all these words as if he were reading to me:  and I wrote in a volume with ink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-986">36:19</span>. And the princes said to Baruch:  Go, and hide thee, both thou and Jeremias, and let no man know where you are.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">36:20</span>. And they went in to the king into the court:  but they laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama the scribe:  and they told all the words in the hearing of the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">36:21</span>. And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume:  who bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe, read it in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">36:22</span>. Now the king sat in the winter house, in the ninth month:  and there was a hearth before him full of burning coals.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-990">36:23</span>. And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife, and he cast it into the fire, that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-991">36:24</span>. And the king and all his servants that heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">36:25</span>. But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the king, not to burn the book:  and he heard them not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">36:26</span>. And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech, and Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, to take up Baruch the scribe, and Jeremias the prophet:  but the Lord hid them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">36:27</span>. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">36:28</span>. Take thee again another volume:  and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of Juda both burnt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">36:29</span>. And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda:  Thus saith the Lord:  Thou hast burnt that volume, saying:  Why hast thou written therein, and said:  The king of Babylon shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land:  and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">36:30</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David:  and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night.<br/>
<br/>
He shall have none, etc. . .Because his son Joachin or Jechonias, within three months after the death of his father, was carried away to Babylon, so that his reign is not worthy of notice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-998">36:31</span>. And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they have not heard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-999">36:32</span>. And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch the son of Nerias the scribe:  who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt with fire:  and there were added besides many more words than had been before.<br/>

Jeremias prophesies that the Chaldeans, who had departed from Jerusalem, would return and burn the city.  He is cast into prison.  His conference with
Sedecias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1002">37:1</span>. Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned instead of Jechonias the son of
Joakim:  whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon made king in the land of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1003">37:2</span>. But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1004">37:3</span>. And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias the prophet, saying:  Pray to the Lord our God for us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1005">37:4</span>. Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people:  for they had not as yet cast him into prison.  And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt:  and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1006">37:5</span>. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1007">37:6</span>. Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel:  Thus shall you say to the king of
Juda, who sent you to inquire of me:  Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1008">37:7</span>. And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1009">37:8</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Deceive not your souls, saying:  The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us:  for they shall not go away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1010">37:9</span>. But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his heart, and burn this city with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1011">37:10</span>. Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao's army,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1012">37:11</span>. Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin:  and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1013">37:12</span>. And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who was there in his turn, was one named
Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias:  and he took hold of Jeremias the prophet, saying:  Thou art fleeing to the
Chaldeans.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1014">37:13</span>. And Jeremias answered:  It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans.  But he hearkened not to him:  so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1015">37:14</span>. Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe:  for he was chief over the prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1016">37:15</span>. So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon:  and Jeremias remained there many days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1017">37:16</span>. Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him:  and asked him secretly in his house, and said:  Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord?  And Jeremias said.  There is.  And he said:  Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1018">37:17</span>. And Jeremias said to king Sedecias:  In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1024">38:1</span>. Now Saphatias the son of Mathan, and Gedelias the son of Phassur, and Juchal the son of Selemias, and Phassur the son of Melchias heard the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1025">38:2</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Whosoever shall remain in this city, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence:  but he that shall go forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life shall be safe, and he shall live.<br/>

We beseech thee that this man may be put to death:  for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words:  for this man seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1028">38:5</span>. And king Sedecias said:  Behold he is in your hands:  for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1029">38:6</span>. Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison:  and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire.  And Jeremias sunk into the mire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1030">38:7</span>. Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon:  but the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1031">38:8</span>. And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1032">38:9</span>. My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1035">38:12</span>. And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias:  Put these old rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon the cords:  and Jeremias did so.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1044">38:21</span>. But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shewn me:<br/>

Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon:  and they shall say:  Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place and they have departed from thee.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1047">38:24</span>. Then Sedecias said to Jeremias:  Let no man know these words, and thou shalt not die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1048">38:25</span>. But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee:  Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee:  and also what the king said to thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1049">38:26</span>. Thou shalt say to them:  I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of Jonathan, to die there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1050">38:27</span>. So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him:  and he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him:  and they left him:  for nothing had been heard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1051">38:28</span>. But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until the day that Jerusalem was taken:  and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken.<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 39<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1053"/>

After two years' siege Jerusalem is taken.  Sedecias is carried before Nabuchodonosor, who kills his sons in his sight, and then puts out his eyes.  Jeremias is set at liberty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1054">39:1</span>. In the ninth year of Sedecias king of Juda, in the tenth month, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army to Jerusalem, and they besieged it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1055">39:2</span>. And in the eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1056">39:3</span>. And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate:  Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1057">39:4</span>. And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war saw them, they fled:  and they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went out to the way of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1058">39:5</span>. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them:  and they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho, and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath:  and he gave judgment upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1059">39:6</span>. And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes:  and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1060">39:7</span>. He also put out the eyes of Sedecias:  and bound him with fetters, to be carried to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1061">39:8</span>. And the Chaldeans burnt the king's house, and the houses of the people with fire, and they threw down the wall of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1062">39:9</span>. And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1063">39:10</span>. But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had nothing at all, in the land of Juda, and he gave them vineyards, and cisterns at that time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1064">39:11</span>. Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1065">39:12</span>. Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm:  but as he hath a mind, so do with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1066">39:13</span>. Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabuzardan, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the king of Babylon,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1067">39:14</span>. Sent and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, that he might go home, and dwell among the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1068">39:15</span>. But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, when he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying:  Go, and tell Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1069">39:16</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Behold I will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good:  and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1070">39:17</span>. And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord:  and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1071">39:18</span>. But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword:  but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 40<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1073"/>

Jeremias remains with Godolias the governor; who receives all the Jews that resort to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1074">40:1</span>. The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that Nabuzardan the general had let him go from Rama, when he had taken him, being bound with chains, among all them that were carried away from Jerusalem and Juda, and were carried to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1075">40:2</span>. And the general of the army taking Jeremias, said to him:  The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1076">40:3</span>. And he hath brought it:  and the Lord hath done as he hath said: because you have sinned against the Lord, and have not hearkened to his voice, and this word is come upon you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1077">40:4</span>. Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hands:  if it please thee to come with me to Babylon, come:  and I will set my eyes upon thee:  but if it do not please thee to come with me to Babylon, stay here:  behold all the land is before thee, as thou shalt choose, and whither it shall please thee to go, thither go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1078">40:5</span>. And come not with me:  but dwell with Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Juda:  dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people:  or whithersoever it shall please thee to go, go.  And the general of the army gave him victuals and presents, and let him go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1079">40:6</span>. And Jeremias went to Godolias the son of Ahicam to Masphath:  and dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1080">40:7</span>. And when all the captains of the army that were scattered through the countries, they and their companions, had heard that the king of Babylon had made Godolias the son of Ahicam governor of the country, and that he had committed unto him men and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, them that had not been carried away captive to Babylon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1081">40:8</span>. They came to Godolias to Masphath:  and Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, and Jonathan, the sons of Caree, and Sareas the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of Netophathi, and Jezonias the son of Maachati, they and their men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1082">40:9</span>. And Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan swore to them and to their companions, saying:  Fear not to serve the Chaldeans:  dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1083">40:10</span>. Behold I dwell in Masphath, that I may answer the commandment of the Chaldeans that are sent to us:  but as for you, gather ye the vintage, and the harvest, and the oil, and lay it up in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you hold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1084">40:11</span>. Moreover all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and in all the countries, when they heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judea, and that he had made Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan ruler over them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1085">40:12</span>. All the Jews, I say, returned out of all the places to which they had fled, and they came into the land of Juda to Godolias to Masphath:  and they gathered wine, and a very great harvest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1086">40:13</span>. Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the army, that had been scattered about in the countries, came to Godolias to Masphath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1087">40:14</span>. And they said to him:  Know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ismahel the son of Nathanias to kill thee.  And Godolias the son of Ahicam believed them not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1088">40:15</span>. But Johanan the son of Caree, spoke to Godolias privately in Masphath, saying:  I will go, and I will kill Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and no man shall know it, lest he kill thee, and all the Jews be scattered, that are gathered unto thee, and the remnant of Juda perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1089">40:16</span>. And Godolias the son of Ahicam said to Johanan the son of Caree: Do not this thing:  for what thou sayst of Ismahel is false.<br/>

Godolias is slain:  the Jews that were with him are apprehensive of the Chaldeans.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1092">41:1</span>. And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath:  and they ate bread there together in Masphath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1093">41:2</span>. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten men that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1094">41:3</span>. Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1095">41:4</span>. And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1096">41:5</span>. There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning:  and they had offerings and incense in their hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1097">41:6</span>. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath to meet them, weeping all along as he went:  and when he had met them, he said to them:  Come to Godolias, the son of Ahicam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1098">41:7</span>. And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1099">41:8</span>. But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel:  Kill us not:  for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey.  And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1100">41:9</span>. And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of Israel:  the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1101">41:10</span>. Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath:  the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Masphath:  whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam.  And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the children of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1102">41:11</span>. But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel the son of Nathanias had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1103">41:12</span>. And taking all the men, they went out to fight against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1106">41:15</span>. But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1108">41:17</span>. And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near Bethlehem:  in order to go forward, and enter into Egypt,<br/>

<p><b>Jeremias Chapter 44<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1150"/>
</b><br/>
The prophet's admonition to the Jews in Egypt against idolatry is not regarded:  he denounces to them their destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1151">44:1</span>. The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in Memphis, and in the land of Phatures, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1152">44:2</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  You have seen all this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Juda:  and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabitant in them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1153">44:3</span>. Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to provoke me to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1154">44:4</span>. And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending, and saying:  Do not commit this abominable thing, which I hate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1155">44:5</span>. But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their evil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1156">44:6</span>. Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem:  and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1157">44:7</span>. And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Why do you commit this great evil against your own souls, that there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling out of the midst of Juda, and no remnant should be left you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1158">44:8</span>. In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you are come to dwell there:  and that you should perish, and be a curse, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1159">44:9</span>. Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1160">44:10</span>. They are not cleansed even to this day:  neither have they feared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments, which I set before you and your fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1161">44:11</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:  Behold I will set my face upon you for evil:  and I will destroy all Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1162">44:12</span>. And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there; and they shall be all consumed in the land of Egypt:  they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine:  and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they die:  and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for a curse, and for a reproach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1163">44:13</span>. And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine and by pestilence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1164">44:14</span>. And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of the remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt:  and that shall return into the land of Juda, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there:  there shall none return but they that shall flee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1165">44:15</span>. Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other gods:  and all the women of whom there stood by a great multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1166">44:16</span>. As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1167">44:17</span>. But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our princes in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem:  and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil.<br/>
<br/>
The queen of heaven. . .The moon, which they worshipped under this name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1168">44:18</span>. But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out frank offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by famine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1169">44:19</span>. And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink offerings to her:  did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1170">44:20</span>. And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1171">44:21</span>. Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1172">44:22</span>. So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1173">44:23</span>. Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the Lord:  and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1174">44:24</span>. And Jeremias said to all the people and to all the women:  Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1175">44:25</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying:  You and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands, saying:  Let us perform our vows which we have made, to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her:  you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed them indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1176">44:26</span>. Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:  Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord:  that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying:  The Lord God liveth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1177">44:27</span>. Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good:  and all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be consumed, by the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1178">44:28</span>. And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda:  and all the remnant of Juda that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1179">44:29</span>. And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place:  that you may know that my words shall be accomplished indeed against you for evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1180">44:30</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will deliver Pharao Nechao king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life:  as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into the land of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy, and that sought his life.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1186">45:4</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Thus shalt thou say to him:  Behold, them whom I have built, I do destroy:  and them whom I have planted, I do pluck up, and all this land.<br/>

The horn of Moab is cut off. . .That is, the strength of Moab is cut off.  A metaphor drawn from animals whose strength is in their horns.<br/>

Melchom. . .The idol of the Ammonites.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1351">50:33</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  The children of Israel, and the children of Juda are oppressed together:  all that have taken them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them go.<br/>

The miseries that shall fall upon Babylon from the Medes:  the destruction of her idols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1367">51:1</span>. Thus saith the Lord:  Behold I will raise up as it were a pestilential wind against Babylon and against the inhabitants thereof, who have lifted up their heart against me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1368">51:2</span>. And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall fan her, and shall destroy her land:  for they are come upon her on every side in the day of her affliction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1369">51:3</span>. Let not him that bendeth, bend his bow, and let not him go up that is armed with a coat of mail:  spare not her young men, destroy all her army.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1370">51:4</span>. And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and the wounded in the regions thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1371">51:5</span>. For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God the Lord of hosts:  but their land hath been filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1372">51:6</span>. Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every one save his own life:  be not silent upon her iniquity:  for it is the time of revenge from the Lord, he will render unto her what she hath deserved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1373">51:7</span>. Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that made all the earth drunk:  the nations have drunk of her wine, and therefore they have staggered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1374">51:8</span>. Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed:  howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1375">51:9</span>. We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed:  let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land:  because her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up to the clouds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1376">51:10</span>. The Lord hath brought forth our justices:  Come, and let us declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1377">51:11</span>. Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers, the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes:  and his mind is against Babylon to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1378">51:12</span>. Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard, strengthen the watch:  set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes:  for the Lord hath both purposed, and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1409">51:43</span>. Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man pass through it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1410">51:44</span>. And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down:  and the nations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of Babylon shall fall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1411">51:45</span>. Go out of the midst of her, my people:  that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1412">51:46</span>. And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land:  and a rumour shall come in one year, and after this year another rumour:  and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1413">51:47</span>. Therefore behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon:  and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1414">51:48</span>. And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon:  for spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1415">51:49</span>. And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel:  so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1416">51:50</span>. You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1417">51:51</span>. We are confounded, because we have heard reproach:  shame hath covered our faces:  because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of the house of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1418">51:52</span>. Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded shall groan:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1419">51:53</span>. If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her strength on high:  from me there should come spoilers upon her, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1420">51:54</span>. The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1421">51:55</span>. Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice:  and their wave shall roar like many waters:  their voice hath made a noise:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1422">51:56</span>. Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1423">51:57</span>. And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men:  and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king whose name is Lord of hosts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1424">51:58</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire, and shall perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1425">51:59</span>. The word that Jeremias the prophet commanded Saraias the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign:  now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1426">51:60</span>. And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon:  all these words that are written against Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1427">51:61</span>. And Jeremias said to Saraias:  When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1428">51:62</span>. Thou shalt say:  O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it:  so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1429">51:63</span>. And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1430">51:64</span>. And thou shalt say:  Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed.  Thus far are the words of Jeremias.<br/>

A recapitulation of the reign of Sedecias, and the destruction of Jerusalem.  The number of the captives.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1433">52:1</span>. Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign:  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  and the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1434">52:2</span>. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1435">52:3</span>. For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and against Juda, till he cast them out from his presence:  and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1436">52:4</span>. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1437">52:5</span>. And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedecias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1438">52:6</span>. And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city:  and there was no food for the people of the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1439">52:7</span>. And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about,) and they went by the way that leadeth to the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1440">52:8</span>. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king:  and they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho:  and all his companions were scattered from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1441">52:9</span>. And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath:  and he gave judgment upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1442">52:10</span>. And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes:  and he slew all the princes of Juda in Reblatha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1443">52:11</span>. And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and he put him in prison till the day of his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1444">52:12</span>. And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan the general of the army, who stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1445">52:13</span>. And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1446">52:14</span>. And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the general broke down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1447">52:15</span>. But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1448">52:16</span>. But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan the general left some for vinedressers, and for husbandmen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1449">52:17</span>. The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass that was in the house of the Lord:  and they carried all the brass of them to Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1450">52:18</span>. And they took the caldrons, and the fleshhooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry:  and<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1451">52:19</span>. The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars, and the cups:  as many as were of gold, in gold:  and as many as were of silver, in silver:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1452">52:20</span>. And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord:  there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1453">52:21</span>. And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about:  but the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1454">52:22</span>. And chapiters of brass were upon both:  and the height of one chapiter was five cubits:  and network, and pomegranates were upon the chapiters round about, all of brass.  The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.<br/>
<br/>
