<p>THE BOOK OF JOB<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book takes its name from the holy man of whom it treats:  who, according to the more probable opinion, was of the race of Esau; and the same as Jobab, king of Edom, mentioned Gen. 36.33.  It is uncertain who was the writer of it.  Some attribute it to Job himself; others to Moses, or some one of the prophets.  In the Hebrew it is written in verse, from the beginning of the third chapter to the forty-second chapter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Job Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Job's virtue and riches.  Satan by permission from God strippeth him of all his substance.  His patience.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.<br/>
<br/>
Hus. . .The land of Hus was a part of Edom; as appears from Lam. 4.21.--Ibid.  Simple. . .That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great:  and this man was great among all the people of the east.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day.  And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.<br/>
<br/>
And made a feast by houses. . .That is, each made a feast in his own house and had his day, inviting the others, and their sisters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them:  and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them.  For he said:  Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts.  So did Job all days.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed. . .For greater horror of the very thought of blasphemy, the scripture both here and ver. 11, and in the following chapter, ver. 5 and 9, uses the word bless to signify its contrary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.<br/>
<br/>
The sons of God. . .The angels.--Ibid.  Satan also, etc.  This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, 1. The restless endeavours of Satan against the servants of God; 2. That he can do nothing without God's permission; 3. That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strength:  but assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And the Lord said to him:  Whence comest thou?  And he answered and said:  I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And the Lord said to him:  Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And Satan answering, said:  Doth Job fear God in vain?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. Then the Lord said to Satan:  Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand:  only put not forth thy hand upon his person.  And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. There came a messenger to Job, and said:  The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said:  The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword:  and I alone have escaped to tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said:  Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead:  and I alone have escaped to tell thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And said:  Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither:  the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:  as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done:  blessed be the name of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-24-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Job Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-25"/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:1</span>. And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:2</span>. That the Lord said to Satan:  Whence comest thou?  And he answered, and said:  I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:3</span>. And the Lord said to Satan:  Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence?  But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:4</span>. And Satan answered, and said:  Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he will give for his life:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:5</span>. But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:6</span>. And the Lord said to Satan:  Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:7</span>. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:8</span>. And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:9</span>. And his wife said to him:  Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity?  bless God and die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:10</span>. And he said to her:  Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women:  If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil?  In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:11</span>. Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite.  For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:12</span>. And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:13</span>. And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no man spoke to him a word:  for they saw that his grief was very great.<br/>

<p><b>Job Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-40"/>
</b><br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:1</span>. After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,<br/>
<br/>
Cursed his day. . .Job cursed the day of his birth, not by way of wishing evil to any thing of God's creation; but only to express in a stronger manner his sense of human miseries in general, and of his own calamities in particular.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:2</span>. And he said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:3</span>. Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said:  A man child is conceived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:4</span>. Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:5</span>. Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:6</span>. Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:7</span>. Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:8</span>. Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:9</span>. Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof:  let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:10</span>. Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:11</span>. Why did I not die in the womb?  why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:12</span>. Why received upon the knees?  why suckled at the breasts?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:13</span>. For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:14</span>. With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:15</span>. Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:16</span>. Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:17</span>. There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:18</span>. And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:19</span>. The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:20</span>. Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:21</span>. That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:22</span>. And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:23</span>. To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:24</span>. Before I eat I sigh:  and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:25</span>. For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me:  and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:26</span>. Have I not dissembled?  have I not kept silence?  have I not been quiet?  and indignation is come upon me.</p>

<p><b>Job Chapter 4</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-68"/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:1</span>. Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:2</span>. If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:3</span>. Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:4</span>. Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:5</span>. But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest:  It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:6</span>. Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:7</span>. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent?  or when were the just destroyed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:8</span>. On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:9</span>. Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:10</span>. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:11</span>. The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:12</span>. Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:13</span>. In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:14</span>. Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:15</span>. And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:16</span>. There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:17</span>. Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?<br/>
<br/>
Shall man be justified in comparison of God, etc. . .These are the words which Eliphaz had heard from an angel, which, ver. 15, he calls a spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:18</span>. Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:19</span>. How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:20</span>. From morning till evening they shall be cut down:  and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:21</span>. And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them:  they shall die, and not in wisdom.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">6:1</span>. But Job answered, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">6:2</span>. O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.<br/>
<br/>
My sins, etc. . .He does not mean to compare his sufferings with his real sins:  but with the imaginary crimes which his friends imputed to him:  and especially with his wrath, or grief, expressed in the third chapter, which they so much accused.  Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">6:3</span>. As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier:  therefore, my words are full of sorrow:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">6:4</span>. For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">6:5</span>. Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass?  or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">6:6</span>. Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt?  or can a man taste that which, when tasted, bringeth death?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">6:7</span>. The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">6:9</span>. And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">6:18</span>. The paths of their steps are entangled:  they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">6:19</span>. Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">6:20</span>. They arc confounded, because I have hoped:  they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">6:21</span>. Now you are come:  and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">6:22</span>. Did I say:  Bring to me, and give me of your substance?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">6:23</span>. Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">6:24</span>. Teach me, and I will hold my peace:  and if I have been ignorant of any thing, instruct me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">6:25</span>. Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">6:26</span>. You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">6:27</span>. You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">6:28</span>. However, finish what you have begun:  give ear and see whether I lie.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">6:29</span>. Answer, I beseech you, without contention:  and speaking that which is just, judge ye.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:30</span>. And you shall not find iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">9:4</span>. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:  who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-204">9:5</span>. Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-205">9:6</span>. Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">9:7</span>. Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not:  and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">9:8</span>. Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">9:9</span>. Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.<br/>
<br/>
Arcturus, etc. . .These are names of stars or constellations.  In Hebrew, Ash, Cesil, and Cimah.  See note chap. 38, ver. 31.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-209">9:10</span>. Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">9:11</span>. If he come to me, I shall not see him:  if he depart, I shall not understand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">9:12</span>. If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him?  or who can say: Why dost thou so?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">9:13</span>. God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">9:14</span>. What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">9:15</span>. I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-215">9:16</span>. And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">9:17</span>. For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.<br/>
<br/>
Without cause. . .That is, without my knowing the cause:  or without any crime of mine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">9:18</span>. He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">9:19</span>. If strength be demanded, he is most strong:  if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">9:20</span>. If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me:  if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">9:21</span>. Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">9:22</span>. One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">9:23</span>. If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">9:25</span>. My days have been swifter than a post:  they have fled away and have not seen good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">9:26</span>. They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">9:27</span>. If I say:  I will not speak so:  I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">9:28</span>. I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">9:29</span>. But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">9:30</span>. If I be washed, as it were, with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">9:31</span>. Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">9:32</span>. For I shall not answer a man that is like myself:  nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">9:33</span>. There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">9:34</span>. Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">9:35</span>. I will speak, and will not fear him:  for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">19:2</span>. How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">19:3</span>. Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">19:4</span>. For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">19:5</span>. But you set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">19:6</span>. At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.<br/>
<br/>
With an equal judgment. . .St. Gregory explains these words thus:  Job being a just man, and truly considering his own life, thought that his affliction was greater than his sins deserved:  and in that respect, that the punishment was not equal, yet it was just, as coming from God, who gives a crown of justice to those who suffer for righteousness' sake, and proves the just with tribulations, as gold is tried by fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">19:7</span>. Behold I shall cry suffering violence, and no one will hear:  I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">19:10</span>. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-477">19:11</span>. His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">19:12</span>. His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-479">19:13</span>. He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.<br/>

<br/>
Ver. 25, 26, and 27 shew Job's explicit belief in his Redeemer, and also of the resurrection of the flesh, not as one tree riseth in place of another, but that the selfsame flesh shall rise at the last day, by the power of God, changed in quality but not in substance, every one to receive sentence according to his works in this life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">19:26</span>. And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">19:27</span>. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another:  this my hope is laid up in my bosom.<br/>

Acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus. . .The Hebrew word, which St. Jerome has here rendered by the name Cocytus, (which the poets represent as a river in hell,) signifies a valley or a torrent:  and in this place, is taken for the low region of death and hell:  which willingly, as it were, receives the wicked at their death:  who are ushered in by innumerable others that have gone before them; and are followed by multitudes above number.<br/>

<br/>
His obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent. . .That is, the omnipotent power of God:  which brought forth all things created in time, but conceived in the Divine mind from all eternity.  The winding serpent, a constellation of fixed stars winding round the north pole, called Draco.  This appears from the foregoing part of the same verse, His spirit hath adorned the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">26:14</span>. Lo, these things are said in part of his ways:  and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</p>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-816">31:16</span>. If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">31:19</span>. If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">31:20</span>. If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-823">31:23</span>. For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was unable to bear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-824">31:24</span>. If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-825">31:25</span>. If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-826">31:26</span>. If I beheld the sun when it shined and the moon going in brightness:<br/>
<br/>
If I beheld the sun, etc. . .If I behold the sun and moon with admiration, knowing them to be created and governed by the power of God, I call on my adversaries to produce any thing against me, whereby I could be charged with worshipping the sun or moon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-827">31:27</span>. And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with, my mouth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-828">31:28</span>. Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-829">31:29</span>. If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-830">31:30</span>. For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-831">31:31</span>. If the men of my tabernacle have not said:  Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-832">31:32</span>. The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-833">31:33</span>. If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-834">31:34</span>. If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me:  and have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-835">31:35</span>. Who would grant me a hearing, that the Almighty may hear my desire:  and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-836">31:36</span>. That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-837">31:37</span>. At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">31:38</span>. If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:<br/>

The words of Job are ended.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-841-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Job Chapter 32</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-842"/>
<br/>
Eliu is angry with Job and his friends.  He boasts of himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">32:1</span>. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-844">32:2</span>. And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation:  now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-845">32:3</span>. And he was angry with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">32:4</span>. So Eliu waited while Job was speaking because they were his elders that were speaking.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">32:5</span>. But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">32:6</span>. Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said:  I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">32:7</span>. For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">32:8</span>. But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">32:9</span>. They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">32:10</span>. Therefore I will speak:  Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">32:11</span>. For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">32:12</span>. And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered:  but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">32:13</span>. Lest you should say:  We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">32:14</span>. He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">32:15</span>. They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">32:16</span>. Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken:  they stood, and answered no more:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-859">32:17</span>. I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-860">32:18</span>. For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">32:19</span>. Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">32:20</span>. I will speak and take breath a little:  I will open my lips, and will answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">32:21</span>. I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.<br/>
<br/>
I will not level God with man. . .Here Eliu considers that Job hath put himself on a level with God, by the manner he assumed to justify his own life in speaking to God as if he spoke to an equal:  Eliu expresses in the following ver. 22 his fear of punishment hereafter for such an attempt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">32:22</span>. For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-865-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Job Chapter 33</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-866"/>
<br/>
Eliu blames Job for asserting his own innocence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-867">33:1</span>. Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">33:2</span>. Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">33:3</span>. My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">33:4</span>. The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">33:5</span>. If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">33:6</span>. Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">33:7</span>. But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-874">33:8</span>. Now thou hast said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-875">33:9</span>. I am clean, and without sin:  I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-876">33:10</span>. Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-877">33:11</span>. He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-878">33:12</span>. Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified:  I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">33:13</span>. Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-880">33:14</span>. God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-881">33:15</span>. By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">33:16</span>. Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">33:17</span>. That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">33:18</span>. Rescuing his soul from corruption:  and his life from passing to the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">33:19</span>. He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">33:20</span>. Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">33:21</span>. His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-888">33:22</span>. His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-889">33:23</span>. If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man's uprightness,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-890">33:24</span>. He shall have mercy on him, and shall say:  Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption:  I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-891">33:25</span>. His flesh is consumed with punishments, let him return to the days of his youth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-892">33:26</span>. He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him:  and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-893">33:27</span>. He shall look upon men, and shall say:  I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-894">33:28</span>. He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-895">33:29</span>. Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-896">33:30</span>. That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-897">33:31</span>. Attend, Job, and hearken to me, and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.<br/>

<p><b>Job Chapter 34</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-901"/>
<br/>
Eliu charges Job with blasphemy:  and sets forth the power and justice of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-902">34:1</span>. And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-903">34:2</span>. Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-904">34:3</span>. For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-905">34:4</span>. Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-906">34:5</span>. For Job hath said:  I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-907">34:6</span>. For in judging me there is a lie:  my arrow is violent without any sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-908">34:7</span>. What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-909">34:8</span>. Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-910">34:9</span>. For he hath said:  Man shall not please God, although he run with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-911">34:10</span>. Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me:  far from God be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-912">34:11</span>. For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-913">34:12</span>. For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-914">34:13</span>. What other hath he appointed over the earth?  or whom hath he set over the world which he made?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-915">34:14</span>. If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-916">34:15</span>. All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-917">34:16</span>. If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-918">34:17</span>. Can he be healed that loveth not judgment?  and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-919">34:18</span>. Who saith to the king:  Thou art an apostate:  who calleth rulers ungodly:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-920">34:19</span>. Who accepteth not the persons of princes:  nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man:  for all are the work of his hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-921">34:20</span>. They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-922">34:21</span>. For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-923">34:22</span>. There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-924">34:23</span>. For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-925">34:24</span>. He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-926">34:25</span>. For he knoweth their works:  and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-927">34:26</span>. He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-928">34:27</span>. Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-929">34:28</span>. So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-930">34:29</span>. For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn?  When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-931">34:30</span>. Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-932">34:31</span>. Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-933">34:32</span>. If I have erred, teach thou me:  if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-934">34:33</span>. Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I:  but if thou know any thing better, speak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-935">34:34</span>. Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-936">34:35</span>. But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-937">34:36</span>. My father, let Job be tried even to the end:  cease not from the man of iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-938">34:37</span>. Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us:  and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">36:6</span>. But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">36:7</span>. He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-966">36:8</span>. And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-967">36:9</span>. He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">36:10</span>. He also shall open their ear, to correct them:  and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">36:12</span>. But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">36:13</span>. Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.<br/>

Out of the narrow mouth. . .That is, out of hell, whose entrance is narrow, and its depth bottomless; but figuratively meant here, that is, from his miseries and calamity to be restored to his former state of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">36:17</span>. Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">36:21</span>. Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity:  for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.<br/>
<br/>
For this thou hast begun to follow after misery. . .Eliu charges Job, that notwithstanding his misery, he does not fear God as he ought:  but in his judgment, falls into iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">36:22</span>. Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-990">36:32</span>. In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1086">39:24</span>. Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1087">39:25</span>. When he heareth the trumpet he saith:  Ha, ha:  he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1088">39:26</span>. Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1089">39:27</span>. Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1090">39:28</span>. She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1091">39:29</span>. From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1092">39:30</span>. Her young ones shall suck up blood:  and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1093">39:31</span>. And the Lord went on, and said to Job:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1094">39:32</span>. Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced?  surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1095">39:33</span>. Then Job answered the Lord, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1096">39:34</span>. What can I answer, who hath spoken inconsiderately?  I will lay my hand upon my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Spoken inconsiderately. . .If we discuss all Job's words (saith St. Gregory), we shall find nothing impiously spoken; as may be gathered from the words of the Lord himself, chap. 42, ver. 7, 8; but what was reprehensible in him, was the manner of expressing himself at times, speaking too much of his own affliction, and too little of God's goodness towards him, which here he acknowledges as inconsiderate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1097">39:35</span>. One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said:  and another, to which I will add no more.</p>

<p><b>Job Chapter 40</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-1099"/>
<br/>
Of the power of God in the behemoth and the leviathan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1100">40:1</span>. And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1101">40:2</span>. Gird up thy loins like a man:  I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1102">40:3</span>. Wilt thou make void my judgment:  and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1103">40:4</span>. And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1104">40:5</span>. Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1105">40:6</span>. Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1106">40:7</span>. Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1107">40:8</span>. Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1108">40:9</span>. Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1109">40:10</span>. Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.<br/>
<br/>
Behemoth. . .In Hebrew, behema, which signifies in general an animal; but many authors explain, that here it is put for the elephant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1110">40:11</span>. His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1111">40:12</span>. He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1112">40:13</span>. His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1113">40:14</span>. He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.<br/>
<br/>
He will apply his sword. . .This text is variously explained:  some explain the sword, the horn given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that God hath given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that God hath given to man to slay him, notwithstanding his great size and strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1114">40:15</span>. To him the mountains bring forth grass:  there all the beasts of the field shall play.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1115">40:16</span>. He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1116">40:17</span>. The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1117">40:18</span>. Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder:  and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1118">40:19</span>. In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1119">40:20</span>. Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?<br/>
<br/>
Leviathan. . .The whale or some sea monster.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1120">40:21</span>. Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1121">40:22</span>. Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1122">40:23</span>. Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1123">40:24</span>. Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1124">40:25</span>. Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1125">40:26</span>. Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1126">40:27</span>. Lay thy hand upon him:  remember the battle, and speak no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1127">40:28</span>. Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.</p>

A further description of the leviathan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1130">41:1</span>. I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1131">41:2</span>. Who hath given me before that I should repay him?  All things that are under heaven are mine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1132">41:3</span>. I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1133">41:4</span>. Who can discover the face of his garment?  or who can go into the midst of his mouth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1134">41:5</span>. Who can open the doors of his face?  his teeth are terrible round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1135">41:6</span>. His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1136">41:7</span>. One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1138">41:9</span>. His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1139">41:10</span>. Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1140">41:11</span>. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1141">41:12</span>. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1142">41:13</span>. In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1143">41:14</span>. The members of his flesh cleave one to another:  he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1144">41:15</span>. His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil,<br/>

Angels. . .Elim, Hebrew:  which signifies here, the mighty, the most valiant, shall fear this monstrous fish, and in their fear shall seek to be purified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1146">41:17</span>. When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.<br/>

Under him. . .He shall not value the beams of the sun; and gold to him shall be like mire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1151">41:22</span>. He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.<br/>

<p><b>Job Chapter 42</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-1156"/>
<br/>
Job submits himself.  God pronounces in his favour.  Job offers sacrifice for his friends.  He is blessed with riches and children, and dies happily,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1157">42:1</span>. Then Job answered the Lord, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1158">42:2</span>. I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1159">42:3</span>. Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?  Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1160">42:4</span>. Hear, and I will speak:  I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1161">42:5</span>. With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1162">42:6</span>. Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1163">42:7</span>. And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite:  My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant Job hath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1164">42:8</span>. Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job shall pray for you:  his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you:  for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1165">42:9</span>. So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1166">42:10</span>. The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends.  And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1167">42:11</span>. And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house:  and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him.  And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1168">42:12</span>. And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.  And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1169">42:13</span>. And he had seven sons, and three daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1170">42:14</span>. And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1171">42:15</span>. And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job:  and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1172">42:16</span>. And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</p>
