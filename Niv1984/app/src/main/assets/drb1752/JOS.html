<p>THE BOOK OF JOSUE<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is called JOSUE, because it contains the history of what passed under him, and according to the common opinion was written by him.  The Greeks call him Jesus:  for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew, are the same name, and have the same signification, viz., A SAVIOUR.  And it was not without a mystery that he who was to bring the people into the land of promise should have his name changed from OSEE (for so he was called before, Num. 13.17,) to JOSUE or JESUS, to give us to understand, that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance, but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into it.<br/>

Josue Chapter 1</b><br/>
<br/>
Josue, encouraged by the Lord, admonisheth the people to prepare themselves to pass over the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue, the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and said to him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Moses my servant is dead:  arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life:  as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee:  I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Take courage, and be strong:  for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Take courage therefore, and be very valiant:  that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth:  but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it:  then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong.  Fear not, and be not dismayed:  because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying:  Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Prepare your victuals:  for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying:  The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan:  but pass you over armed before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And they made answer to Josue, and said:  All that thou hast commanded us, we will do:  and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also:  only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die:  only take thou courage, and do manfully.<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-21"/>
<br/>
Two spies are sent to Jericho, who are received and concealed by Rahab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:1</span>. And Josue, the son of Nun, sent from Setim two men, to spy secretly:  and said to them:  Go, and view the land, and the city of Jericho.  They went, and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged with her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:2</span>. And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said:  Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:3</span>. And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying:  Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house:  for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:4</span>. And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said:  I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:5</span>. And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together.  I know not whither they are gone:  pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:6</span>. But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:7</span>. Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan:  and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:8</span>. The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:9</span>. I know that the Lord hath given this land to you:  for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:10</span>. We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea, at your going in, when you came out of Egypt:  and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and Og whom you slew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:11</span>. And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming in:  for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:12</span>. Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewed mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father's house:  and give me a true token.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:13</span>. That you will save my father and mother, my brethren and sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:14</span>. They answered her:  Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not.  And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:15</span>. Then she let them down with a cord out of a window:  for her house joined close to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:16</span>. And she said to them:  Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return:  and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:17</span>. And they said to her:  We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:18</span>. If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down:  and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred into thy house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:19</span>. Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit.  But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:20</span>. But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath, which thou hast made us swear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:21</span>. And she answered:  As you have spoken, so be it done:  and sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:22</span>. But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days, till they that pursued them were returned.  For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:23</span>. And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain:  and passing over the Jordan, they came to Josue, the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:24</span>. And said:  the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 3</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-47"/>
<br/>
The river Jordan is miraculously dried up for the passage of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:1</span>. And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp:  and they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan:  he, and all the children of Israel, and they abode there for three days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:2</span>. After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:3</span>. And began to proclaim:  When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:4</span>. And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits:  that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have not gone this way before:  and take care you come not near the ark.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:5</span>. And Josue said to the people:  Be ye sanctified:  for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:6</span>. And he said to the priests:  Take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people.  And they obeyed his commands, and took it up, and walked before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:7</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel:  that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with thee also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:8</span>. And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, and say to them:  When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan, stand in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:9</span>. And Josue said to the children of Israel:  Come hither, and hear the word of the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:10</span>. And again he said:  By this you shall know, that the Lord, the living God, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before your sight, the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also, and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:11</span>. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:12</span>. Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of every tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:13</span>. And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off:  and those that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:14</span>. So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant, went on before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:15</span>. And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had filled the banks of its channel,)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:16</span>. The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan:  but those that were beneath, ran down into the sea of the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:17</span>. And the people marched over against Jericho:  and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over, through the channel that was dried up.<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 4</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-66"/>
<br/>
Twelve stones are taken out of the river to be set up for a monument of the miracle; and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">4:1</span>. And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">4:2</span>. Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:3</span>. And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:4</span>. And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:5</span>. And he said to them:  Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:6</span>. That it may be a sign among you:  and when your children shall ask you tomorrow, saying:  What means these stones?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:7</span>. You shall answer them:  The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same:  therefore were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:8</span>. The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them, carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:9</span>. And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant:  and they are there until this present day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:10</span>. Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the Jordan, till all things were accomplished, which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him.  And the people made haste, and passed over.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:11</span>. And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:12</span>. The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had commanded them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:13</span>. And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:14</span>. In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:15</span>. And he said to him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:16</span>. Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:17</span>. And he commanded them, saying:  Come ye up out of the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:18</span>. And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:19</span>. And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:20</span>. And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:21</span>. And said to the children of Israel:  When your children shall ask their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them:  What mean these stones?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:22</span>. You shall teach them, and say:  Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry channel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:23</span>. The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:24</span>. As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:25</span>. That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 5</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-93"/>
<br/>
The people are circumcised:  they keep the pasch.  The manna ceaseth.  An angel appeareth to Josue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">5:1</span>. Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">5:2</span>. At that time the Lord said to Josue:  Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
The second time. . .Not that such as had been circumcised before were to be circumcised again; but that they were now to renew, and take up again the practice of circumcision; which had been omitted during their forty years' sojourning in the wilderness; by reason of their being always uncertain when they should be obliged to march.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">5:3</span>. He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">5:4</span>. Now this is the cause of the second circumcision:  All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">5:6</span>. Now these were all circumcised.  But the people that were born in the desert,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">5:6</span>. During the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were uncircumcised:  till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">5:7</span>. The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were circumcised by Josue:  for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">5:8</span>. Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">5:9</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt.  And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">5:10</span>. And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of Jericho:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">5:11</span>. And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land, and frumenty of the same year.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">5:12</span>. And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">5:13</span>. And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said:  Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">5:14</span>. And he answered:  No:  but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am come.<br/>
<br/>
Prince of the host of the Lord, etc. . .St. Michael, who is called prince of the people of Israel, Dan. 10.21.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">5:15</span>. Josue fell on his face to the ground.  And worshipping, said:  What saith my lord to his servant?<br/>
<br/>
Worshipping. . .Not with divine honour, but with a religious veneration of an inferior kind, suitable to the dignity of his person.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">5:16</span>. Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet:  for the place whereon thou standest is holy.  And Josue did as was commanded him.<br/>

After seven days' processions, the priests sounding the trumpets, the walls of Jericho fall down:  and the city is taken and destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">6:1</span>. Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">6:2</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">6:3</span>. Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day:  so shall ye do for six days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">6:4</span>. And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant:  and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">6:5</span>. And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">6:6</span>. Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them: Take the ark of the covenant:  and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">6:7</span>. And he said to the people:  Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">6:8</span>. And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">6:9</span>. And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">6:10</span>. But Josue had commanded the people, saying:  You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth:  until the day come wherein I shall say to you:  Cry, and shout.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">6:11</span>. So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">6:12</span>. And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">6:13</span>. And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">6:14</span>. And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp.  So they did six days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">6:15</span>. But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">6:16</span>. And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel:  Shout:  for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">6:17</span>. And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord.  Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house:  for she hid the messengers whom we sent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">6:18</span>. But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">6:19</span>. But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">6:20</span>. So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith fell down:  and every man went up by the place that was over against him:  and they took the city,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">6:21</span>. And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old.  The oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">6:22</span>. But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies:  Go into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">6:23</span>. And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">6:24</span>. But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord.  _<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">6:25</span>. But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father's house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho.  At that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">6:26</span>. Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho.  In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.<br/>
<br/>
Cursed, etc. . .Jericho, in the mystical sense, signifies iniquity:  the sounding of the trumpets by the priests, the preaching of the word of God; by which the walls of Jericho are thrown down, when sinners are converted; and a dreadful curse will light on them who build them up again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">6:27</span>. And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all the land<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 7</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-140"/>
<br/>
For the sins of Achan, the Israelites are defeated at Hai.  The offender is found out; and stoned to death, and God's wrath is turned from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">7:1</span>. But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and took to their own use of that which was accursed.  For Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took something of the anathema:  and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">7:2</span>. And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them:  Go up, and view the country:  and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">7:3</span>. And returning, they said to him:  Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city:  why should all the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">7:4</span>. There went up therefore three thousand fighting men:  who immediately turned their backs,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">7:5</span>. And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty men:  and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent:  and the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">7:6</span>. But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before the ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of Israel:  and they put dust upon their heads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">7:7</span>. And Josue said:  Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and to destroy us?  would God we had stayed beyond the Jordan, as we began.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">7:8</span>. My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">7:9</span>. The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth:  and what wilt thou do to thy great name?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">7:10</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  Arise, why liest thou flat on the ground?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">7:11</span>. Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant:  and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among their goods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">7:12</span>. Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee from them:  because he is defiled with the anathema.  I will be no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">7:13</span>. Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them:  Be ye sanctified against tomorrow:  for thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  The curse is in the midst of thee, O Israel:  thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">7:14</span>. And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes:  and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">7:15</span>. And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">7:16</span>. Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to come by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">7:17</span>. Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family of Zare.  Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">7:18</span>. And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">7:19</span>. And Josue said to Achan:  My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">7:20</span>. And Achan answered Josue, and said to him:  Indeed I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">7:21</span>. For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding good, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles:  and I coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">7:22</span>. Josue therefore sent ministers:  who running to his tent, found all hid in the same place, together with the silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">7:23</span>. And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">7:24</span>. Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare, and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and all the goods:  and brought them to the valley of Achor:<br/>
<br/>
His sons, etc. . .Probably conscious to, or accomplices of, the crime of their father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">7:25</span>. Where Josue said:  Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord trouble thee this day.  And all Israel stoned him:  and all things that were his, were consumed with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:26</span>. And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them.  And the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor, until this day.<br/>

Achor. . .That is, trouble.</p>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 8</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-168"/>
<br/>
Hai is taken and burnt, and all the inhabitants slain.  An altar is built, and sacrifices offered.  The law is written on stones, and the blessings and cursings are read before all the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">8:1</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  Fear not, nor be thou dismayed:  take with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go up to the town of Hai:  Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and the people, and the city, and the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">8:2</span>. And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof:  but the spoils, and all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves:  lay an ambush for the city behind it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">8:3</span>. And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to go up against Hai:  and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">8:4</span>. And commanded them, saying:  Lay an ambush behind the city:  and go not very far from it:  and be ye all ready.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">8:5</span>. But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will approach on the contrary side against the city.  And when they shall come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">8:6</span>. Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city:  for they will think that we flee as before.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">8:7</span>. And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city:  and the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">8:8</span>. And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do all things so as I have commanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">8:9</span>. And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city of Hai.  But Josue staid that night in the midst of the people,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">8:10</span>. And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the aid of the fighting men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">8:11</span>. And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there was a valley in the midst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">8:12</span>. And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:<br/>
<br/>
Five thousand. . .These were part of the thirty thousand mentioned above, ver. 3.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">8:13</span>. But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city.  So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">8:14</span>. And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array, toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">8:15</span>. But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">8:16</span>. But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued them.  And when they were come from the city,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">8:17</span>. And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">8:18</span>. The Lord said to Josue:  Lift up the shield that is in thy hand, towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">8:19</span>. And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the ambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately:  and going to the city, took it, and set it on fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">8:20</span>. And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue, looking back, and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power to flee this way or that way:  especially as they that had counterfeited flight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly against them that pursued.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">8:21</span>. So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">8:22</span>. And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them.  So that the enemies being cut off on both sides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">8:23</span>. And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to Josue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">8:24</span>. So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight to the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place, the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">8:25</span>. And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-194">8:26</span>. But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">8:27</span>. And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">8:28</span>. And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">8:29</span>. And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and the going down of the sun.  Then Josue commanded, and they took down his carcass from the gibbet:  and threw it in the very entrance of the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">8:30</span>. Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Hebal,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">8:31</span>. As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and it is written in the book of the law of Moses:  an altar of unhewn stones, which iron had not touched:  and he offered upon it holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">8:32</span>. And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses, which he had ordered before the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">8:33</span>. And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord, had commanded.  And first he blessed the people of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-202">8:34</span>. After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing, and all things that were written in the book of the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">8:35</span>. He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded, but he repeated all before all the people of Israel, with the women and children, and strangers, that dwelt among them.<br/>

Now when these things were heard of, all the kings beyond the Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains, and in the plains, in the places near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">9:11</span>. And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country, said to us:  Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">9:12</span>. Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces by being exceeding old.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">9:13</span>. These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are rent and burst.  These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our feet, by reason of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost consumed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">9:14</span>. They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not the mouth of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">9:15</span>. And Josue made peace with them, and entering into a league, promised that they should not be slain:  the princes also of the multitude swore to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">9:16</span>. Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">9:17</span>. And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities on the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">9:18</span>. And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.  Then all the common people murmured against the princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">9:19</span>. And they answered them:  We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">9:20</span>. But this we will do to them:  Let their lives be saved, lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">9:21</span>. But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood, and bringing in water.  As they were speaking these things,<br/>
<br/>
9;22. Josue called the Gabaonites, and said to them:  Why would you impose upon us, saying:  We dwell very far off from you, whereas you are in the midst of us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">9:23</span>. Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">9:24</span>. They answered:  It was told us, thy servants, that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof.  Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives, compelled by the dread we had of you, and we took this counsel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">9:25</span>. And now we are in thy hand:  deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">9:26</span>. So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">9:27</span>. And he gave orders in that day, that they should be in the service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood, and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the Lord hath chosen.<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 10<br id="bookmark-drb1752-233"/>
</b><br/>
Five kings war against Gabaon.  Josue defeateth them:  many are slain with hailstones.  At the prayer of Josue the sun and moon stand still the space of one day.  The five kings are hanged.  Divers cities are taken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">10:1</span>. When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">10:2</span>. He was exceedingly afraid.  For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">10:3</span>. Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of Hebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">10:4</span>. Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">10:5</span>. So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together, went up:  the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">10:6</span>. But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants:  come up quickly, and save us, and bring us succour:  for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">10:7</span>. And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him, most valiant men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">10:8</span>. But the Lord said to Josue:  Fear them not:  for I have delivered them into thy hands:  none of them shall be able to stand against thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">10:9</span>. So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">10:10</span>. And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel:  and he slew them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">10:11</span>. And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were in the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, as far as Azeca:  and many more were killed with the hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">10:12</span>. Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them:  Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">10:13</span>. And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies.  Is not this written in the book of the just?  So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day.<br/>
<br/>
The book of the just. . .In Hebrew Jasher:  an ancient book long since lost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">10:14</span>. There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">10:15</span>. And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">10:16</span>. For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">10:17</span>. And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the city of Maceda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">10:18</span>. And he commanded them that were with him, saying:  Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut up:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">10:19</span>. And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">10:20</span>. So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered into fenced cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">10:21</span>. And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda, where the camp then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one:  and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">10:22</span>. And Josue gave orders, saying:  Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">10:23</span>. And the ministers did as they were commanded:  and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave:  the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">10:24</span>. And when they were brought out to him, he called all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him:  Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings.  And when they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">10:25</span>. He said again to them:  Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage, and be strong:  for so will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">10:26</span>. And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets; and they hung until the evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">10:27</span>. And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets.  And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">10:28</span>. The same day Josue took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof:  he left not in it the least remains.  And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">10:29</span>. And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought against it:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">10:30</span>. And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel:  and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants thereof.  They left not in it any remains.  And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">10:31</span>. From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel:  and investing it with his army, besieged it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">10:32</span>. And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">10:33</span>. At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">10:34</span>. And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">10:35</span>. And took it the same day:  and put to the sword all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">10:36</span>. He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought against it:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">10:37</span>. Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword:  the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that dwelt in it:  he left not therein any remains:  as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.<br/>
<br/>
The king. . .Viz., the new king, who succeeded him that was slain, ver. 26.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">10:38</span>. Returning from thence to Dabir,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">10:39</span>. He took it, and destroyed it:  the king also thereof, and all the towns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword:  he left not in it any remains:  as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">10:40</span>. So Josue conquered all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings:  he left not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him.<br/>
<br/>
Any remains therein, but slew, etc. . .God ordered these people to be utterly destroyed, in punishment of their manifold abomination; and that they might not draw the Israelites into the like sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">10:41</span>. From Cadesbarne even to Gaza.  All the land of Gosen even to Gabaon,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">10:42</span>. And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one onset:  for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">10:43</span>. And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal.</p>

The kings of the north are overthrown:  the whole country is taken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">11:1</span>. And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king of Achsaph:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">11:2</span>. And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea side:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">11:3</span>. To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the mountains:  to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land of Maspha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">11:4</span>. And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and chariots a very great multitude,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">11:5</span>. And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">11:6</span>. And the Lord said to Josue:  Fear them not:  for to morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.<br/>
<br/>
Hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire, etc. . .God so ordained, that his people might not trust in chariots and horses, but in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">11:7</span>. And Josue came, and all the army with him, against them to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-286">11:8</span>. And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel.  And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">11:9</span>. And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">11:10</span>. And presently turning back he took Asor:  and slew the king thereof with the sword.  Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-289">11:11</span>. And he cut off all the souls that abode there:  he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-291">11:13</span>. Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest Israel burned:  only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-293">11:15</span>. As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Josue, and he accomplished all:  he left not one thing undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-294">11:16</span>. So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:<br/>

A long time. . .Seven years, as appears from chap. 14.10.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-297">11:19</span>. There was not a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon:  for he took all by fight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-298">11:20</span>. For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/>
<br/>
Hardened. . .This hardening of their hearts, was their having no thought of yielding or submitting:  which was a sentence or judgment of God upon them in punishment of their enormous crimes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-299">11:21</span>. At that time Josue came and cut off the Enancims from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-300">11:22</span>. He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the children of Israel:  except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and Azotus, in which alone they were left.<br/>

<br/>
God commandeth Josue to divide the land:  the possessions of Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, beyond the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-330">13:1</span>. Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to him:  Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot:<br/>
<br/>
Josue was old, and far advanced in years. . .He was then about one hundred and one years old.--And there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot. . .Not yet possessed by the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-331">13:2</span>. To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-332">13:3</span>. From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the border of Accaron northward:  the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-333">13:4</span>. And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-334">13:5</span>. And his confines.  The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">13:6</span>. Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians.  I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel.  So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-336">13:7</span>. And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-337">13:8</span>. With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side.<br/>
<br/>
With whom. . .That is, with the other half of that same tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">13:9</span>. From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-339">13:10</span>. And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-342">13:13</span>. And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and Machati and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">13:15</span>. And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">13:16</span>. And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent:  all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-346">13:17</span>. And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon,<br/>

And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian:  Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land.<br/>
<br/>
The princes of Madian. . .It appears from hence that these were subjects of king Sehon:  they are said to have been slain with him, that is, about the same time, but not in the same battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-351">13:22</span>. Balaam also the son of Beor the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">13:23</span>. And the river Jordan was the border of the children of Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities and villages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">13:24</span>. And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession, of which this is the division.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">13:25</span>. The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon:  as far as Aroer which is over against Rabba:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">13:26</span>. And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim:  and from Manaim unto the borders of Dabir.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">13:27</span>. And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon:  the limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of the sea of Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">13:28</span>. This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">13:29</span>. He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-359">13:30</span>. The beginning whereof is this:  from Manaim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-360">13:31</span>. And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan:  to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">13:32</span>. This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">13:33</span>. But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession:  because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them.</p>

Caleb's petition; Hebron is given to him and to his seed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">14:1</span>. This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land of Chanaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">14:2</span>. Dividing all by lot, as the Lord had commanded the hand of Moses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-367">14:3</span>. For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the Jordan:  besides the Levites, who received no land among their brethren:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">14:4</span>. But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim:  neither did the Levites receive other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks.<br/>
<br/>
Hebron belonged, etc. . .All the country thereabouts, depending on Hebron, was given to Caleb; but the city itself with the suburbs, was one of those that were given to the priests to dwell in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">14:5</span>. As the Lord had commanded Moses so did the children of Israel, and they divided the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">14:6</span>. Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite spoke to him:  Thou knowest what the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesbarne.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">14:7</span>. I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word again as to me seemed true,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">14:8</span>. But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart of the people:  and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">14:9</span>. And Moses swore in that day, saying:  The land which thy foot hath trodden upon shall be thy possession, and thy children for ever, because thou hast followed the Lord my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">14:10</span>. The Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until this present day, It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness:  this day I am eighty-five years old,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">14:11</span>. As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land:  the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to fight as to march.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">14:12</span>. Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong:  if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">14:13</span>. And Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron in possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">14:14</span>. And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, until this present day:  because he followed the Lord the God of Israel.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">15:2</span>. Its beginning was from the top of the most salt sea, and from the bay thereof, that looketh to the south.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">15:3</span>. And it goeth out towards the ascent of the Scorpion, and passeth on to Sina:  and ascendeth into Cadesbarne, and reacheth into Esron, going up to Addar, and compassing Carcaa.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">15:4</span>. And from thence passing along into Asemona, and reaching the torrent of Egypt:  and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea, this shall be the limit of the south coast.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">15:5</span>. But on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt sea even to the end of the Jordan:  and towards the north from the bay of the sea unto the same river Jordan.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">15:7</span>. And reaching as far as the borders of Debara from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Galgal, which is opposite to the ascent of Adommin, on the south side of the torrent, and the border passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun:  and the goings out thereof shall be at the fountain Rogel.<br/>

And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the side of the Jebusite towards the south, the same is Jerusalem:  and thence ascending to the top of the mountain, which is over against Geennom to the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim, northward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">15:9</span>. And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the water of Nephtoa:  and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron:  and it bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, the city of the woods.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">15:13</span>. But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda, as the Lord had commanded him:  Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac, which is Hebron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">15:14</span>. And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac, Sesai and Ahiman, and Tholmai of the race of Enac.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">15:15</span>. And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of Dabir, which before was called Cariath-Sepher, that is to say, the city of letters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">15:16</span>. And Caleb said:  He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and take it, I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">17:2</span>. And to the rest of the children of Manasses according to their families:  to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helec, and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of Sechem, and to the children of Hepher, and to the children of Semida:  these are the male children of Manasses the son of Joseph, by their kindreds.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">17:4</span>. And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest and of Josue the son of Nun, and of the princes, saying:  The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, that a possession should be given us in the midst of our brethren.  And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a possession amongst the brethren of their father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">17:5</span>. And there fell ten portions to Manasses, beside the land of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">17:13</span>. But after that the children of Israel were grown strong, they subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and they did not kill them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">17:14</span>. And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and said:  Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas I am of so great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">17:15</span>. And Josue said to them:  If thou be a great people, go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the Raphaims:  because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">17:16</span>. And the children of Joseph answered him:  We cannot go up to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley, have chariots of iron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">17:17</span>. And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot only:<br/>

<br/>
The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses return to their possessions.  They build an altar by the side of the Jordan, which alarms the other tribes.  An embassage is sent to them, to which they give a satisfactory answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">22:1</span>. At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">22:2</span>. And said to them:  You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you:  you have also obeyed me in all things,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-620">22:3</span>. Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">22:4</span>. Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace, as he promised:  return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-622">22:5</span>. Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you:  that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">22:6</span>. And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to their dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-624">22:7</span>. Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in Basan:  and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west.  And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-625">22:8</span>. He said to them:  With much substance and riches, you return to your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of raiment:  divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-626">22:9</span>. So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">22:10</span>. And when they were come to banks of the Jordan, in the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.<br/>

And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain messengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">22:12</span>. They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">22:13</span>. And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">22:14</span>. And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">22:15</span>. Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">22:16</span>. Thus saith all the people of the Lord:  What meaneth this transgression?  Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-634">22:17</span>. Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day?  and many of the people perished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-635">22:18</span>. And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-636">22:19</span>. But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us:  only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-637">22:20</span>. Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel?  And he was but one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-638">22:21</span>. And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-639">22:22</span>. The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand:  If with the design of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">22:23</span>. And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-641">22:24</span>. And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say: To morrow your children will say to our children:  What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">22:25</span>. The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad:  and therefore you have no part in the Lord.  And by this occasion your children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord.  We therefore thought it best,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">22:26</span>. And said:  Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-644">22:27</span>. But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to morrow may not say to our children:  You have no part in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-645">22:28</span>. And if they will say so, they shall answer them:  Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">22:29</span>. God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">22:30</span>. And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied:  and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">22:31</span>. And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them:  Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-649">22:32</span>. And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-650">22:33</span>. And the saying pleased all that heard it.  And the children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Josue Chapter 24</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-671"/>
<br/>
Josue assembleth the people, and reneweth the covenant between them and God.  His death and burial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-672">24:1</span>. And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Israel in Sichem, and called for the ancients, and the princes and the judges, and the masters:  and they stood in the sight of the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">24:2</span>. And he spoke thus to the people:  Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel:  Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Thare the father of Abraham, and Nachor:  and they served strange gods.<br/>
<br/>
Of the river. . .The Euphrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-674">24:3</span>. And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of Chanaan:  and I multiplied his seed,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-675">24:4</span>. And gave him Isaac:  and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau.  And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession:  but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">24:5</span>. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many signs and wonders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">24:6</span>. And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea:  and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">24:7</span>. And the children of Israel cried to the Lord:  and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them.  Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">24:8</span>. And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite, who dwelt beyond the Jordan.  And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">24:9</span>. And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought against Israel.  And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">24:10</span>. And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I blessed you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">24:11</span>. And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho.  And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:  and I delivered them into your hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">24:12</span>. And I sent before you and I drove them out from their places, the two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword nor with thy bow,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">24:13</span>. And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you planted not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">24:14</span>. Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect and most sincere heart:  and put away the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">24:15</span>. But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have your choice:  choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house we will serve thee Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">24:16</span>. And the people answered, and said, God forbid we should leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">24:17</span>. The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:  and did very great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed, and among all the people through whom we passed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">24:18</span>. And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the inhabitant of the land into which we are come.  Therefore we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">24:19</span>. And Josue said to the people:  You will not be able to serve the Lord:  for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your wickedness and sins.<br/>
<br/>
You will not be able to serve the Lord, etc. . .This was not said by way of discouraging them; but rather to make them more earnest and resolute, by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking, and the courage and constancy necessary to go through with it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">24:20</span>. If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good he hath done you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">24:21</span>. And the people said to Josue:  No, it shall not be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">24:22</span>. And Josue said to the people, You are witnesses, that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him.  And they answered:  We are witnesses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">24:23</span>. Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">24:24</span>. And the people said to Josue:  We will serve the Lord our God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">24:25</span>. Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">24:26</span>. And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the Lord:  and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">24:27</span>. And he said to all the people:  Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken to you:  lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and lie to the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
It hath heard. . .This is a figure of speech, by which sensation is attributed to inanimate things; and they are called upon, as it were, to bear witness in favour of the great Creator, whom they on their part constantly obey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">24:28</span>. And he sent the people away every one to their own possession,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">24:29</span>. And after these things Josue the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:<br/>
<br/>
And after, etc. . .If Josue wrote this book, as is commonly believed, these last verses were added by Samuel, or some other prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">24:30</span>. And they buried him in the border of his possession in Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaas.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">24:31</span>. And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue, and of the ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">24:32</span>. And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a hundred young ewes, and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">24:33</span>. Eleazar also the son of Aaron died:  and they buried him in Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.<br/>
