<p>THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is called LEVITICUS, because it treats of the Offices, Ministries, Rites and Ceremonies of the Priests and Levites.  The Hebrews call it VAICRA, from the word with which it begins.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Leviticus Chapter 1</b><br/>
<br/>
Of holocausts or burnt offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and sheep:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him.<br/>
<br/>
A holocaust. . .That is, a whole burnt offering (olokauston), so called, because the whole victim was consumed with fire; and given in such manner to God as wholly to evaporate, as it were, for his honour and glory; without having any part of it reserved for the use of man.  The other sacrifices in the Old Testament were either offerings for sin, or peace offerings:  and these latter again were either offered in thanksgiving for blessings received; or by way of prayer for new favours or graces.  So that sacrifices were then offered to God for four different ends or intentions, answerable to the different obligations which man has to God:  1. By way of adoration, homage, praise, and glory due to his divine majesty.  2. By way of thanksgiving for all benefits received from him.  3. By way of confessing and craving pardon for sins. 4. By way of prayer and petition for grace and relief in all necessities.  In the New Law we have but one sacrifice, viz., that of the body and blood of Christ:  but this one sacrifice of the New Testament perfectly answers all these four ends; and both priest and people, as often as it is celebrated, ought to join in offering it up for these four ends.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim:  and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord:  and the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof, pouring it round about the altar, which is before the door of the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And when they have flayed the victim, they shall cut the joints into pieces:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in order a pile of wood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon: to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to the liver;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. The entrails and feet being washed with water.  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And if the offering be of the flocks, a holocaust of sheep or of goats, he shall offer a male without blemish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north, before the Lord:  but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that cleave to the liver:  and shall lay them upon the wood, under which the fire is to be put.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water.  And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. The priest shall offer it at the altar:  and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife:  and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood.  It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>

<p><b>Leviticus Chapter 2</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-20"/>
<br/>
Of offerings of flour, and firstfruits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:1</span>. When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour:  and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:2</span>. And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests.  And one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense; and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:3</span>. And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron's, and his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Holy of holies. . .That is, most holy, as being dedicated to God, and set aside by his ordinance for the use of his priests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:4</span>. But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:5</span>. If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:6</span>. Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:7</span>. And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:8</span>. And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:9</span>. And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:10</span>. And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron's, and his sons':  holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:11</span>. Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven:  neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Without leaven or honey. . .No leaven nor honey was to be used in the sacrifice offered to God; to signify that we are to exclude from the pure worship of the gospel, all double dealing and affection to carnal pleasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:12</span>. You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts:  but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:13</span>. Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt:  neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice.  In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.<br/>
<br/>
Salt. . .In every sacrifice salt was to be used, which is an emblem of wisdom and discretion, without which none of our performances are agreeable to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:14</span>. But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal; and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:15</span>. Pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense, because it is the oblation of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:16</span>. Whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift, part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and all the frankincense.<br/>

<br/>
Of peace offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">3:1</span>. And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings, and he will offer of the herd, whether male or female:  he shall offer them without blemish before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Peace offerings. . .Peace, in the scripture language, signifies happiness, welfare or prosperity; in a word, all kind of blessings.--Such sacrifices, therefore, as were offered either on occasion of blessings received, or to obtain new favours, were called pacific or peace offerings.  In these, some part of the victim was consumed with fire on the altar of God; other parts were eaten by the priests and by the persons for whom the sacrifice was offered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">3:2</span>. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim, which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:3</span>. And they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings, for an oblation to the Lord:  the fat that covereth the entrails, and all the fat that is within,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:4</span>. The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the flanks are covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:5</span>. And they shall burn them upon the altar, for a holocaust, putting fire under the wood:  for an oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:6</span>. But if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offering be of the flock, whether he offer male or female, they shall be without blemish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:7</span>. If he offer a lamb before the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:8</span>. He shall put his hand upon the head of the victim.  And it shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:9</span>. And they shall offer of the victim of peace offerings, a sacrifice to the Lord:  the fat and the whole rump,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:10</span>. With the kidneys, and the fat that covereth the belly and all the vitals and both the little kidneys, with the fat that is about the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:11</span>. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of the oblation of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:12</span>. If his offering be a goat, and he offer it to the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:13</span>. He shall put his hand upon the head thereof:  and shall immolate it in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony.  And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:14</span>. And they shall take of it for the food of the Lord's fire, the fat that covereth the belly, and that covereth all the vital parts:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:15</span>. The two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:16</span>. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of a most sweet savour.  All the fat shall be the Lord's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:17</span>. By a perpetual law for your generations, and in all your habitations:  neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all.<br/>
<br/>
Fat. . .It is meant of the fat, which by the prescription of the law was to be offered on God's altar; not of the fat of meat, such as we commonly eat.<br/>

<br/>
Of offerings for sins of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">4:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">4:2</span>. Say to the children of Israel:  The soul that sinneth through ignorance, and doth any thing concerning any of the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded not to be done:<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance. . .To be ignorant of what we are bound to know is sinful; and for such culpable ignorance, these sacrifices, prescribed in this and the following chapter, were appointed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">4:3</span>. If the priest that is anointed shall sin, making the people to offend, he shall offer to the Lord for his sin a calf without blemish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">4:4</span>. And he shall bring it to the door of the testimony before the Lord:  and shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall sacrifice it to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">4:5</span>. He shall take also of the blood of the calf:  and carry it into the tabernacle of the testimony.<br/>
<br/>
The blood. . .As the figure of the blood of Christ shed for the remission of our sins, and carried by him into the sanctuary of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">4:6</span>. And having dipped his finger in the blood, he shall sprinkle with it seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">4:7</span>. And he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of the altar of the sweet incense most acceptable to the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the testimony.  And he shall pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry of the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">4:8</span>. And he shall take off the fat of the calf for the sin offering, as well that which covereth the entrails, as all the inwards:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">4:9</span>. The two little kidneys, and the caul that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">4:10</span>. As it is taken off from the calf of the sacrifice of peace offerings.  And he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">4:11</span>. But the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet and the bowels and the dung:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:12</span>. And the rest of the body, he shall carry forth without the camp into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be poured out:  and he shall burn them upon a pile of wood.  They shall be burnt in the place where the ashes are poured out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:13</span>. And if all the multitude of Israel shall be ignorant, and through ignorance shall do that which is against the commandment of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:14</span>. And afterwards shall understand their sin:  they shall offer for their sin a calf, and shall bring it to the door of the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:15</span>. And the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon the head thereof before the Lord.  And the calf being immolated in the sight of the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:16</span>. The priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the tabernacle of the testimony.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:17</span>. And shall dip his finger in it and sprinkle it seven times before the veil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:18</span>. And he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord, in the tabernacle of the testimony.  And the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:21</span>. But the calf itself he shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn it as he did the former calf:  because it is for the sin of the multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:22</span>. If a prince shall sin, and through ignorance do any one of the things that the law of the Lord forbiddeth,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:25</span>. The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for sin, touching therewith the horns of the altar of holocaust, and pouring out the rest at the foot thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:26</span>. But the fat he shall burn upon it, as is wont to be done with the victims of peace offerings.  And the priest shall pray for him, and for his sin:  and it shall be forgiven him.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:32</span>. But if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin, to wit, an ewe without blemish:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:33</span>. He shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are wont to be slain.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">9:8</span>. And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated the calf for his sin.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">9:10</span>. And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">9:22</span>. And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">9:23</span>. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people.  And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">9:24</span>. And, behold, a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar:  which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">10:2</span>. And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them:  and they died before the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">10:3</span>. And Moses said to Aaron:  This is what the Lord hath spoken.  I will be sanctified in them that approach to me:  and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people.  And when Aaron heard this, he held his peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">10:4</span>. And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan, the sons of Oziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said to them:  Go and take away your brethren from before the sanctuary, and carry them without the camp.<br/>

Let your brethren, and all the house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled.<br/>

<br/>
The distinction of clean and unclean animals.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">11:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">11:2</span>. Say to the children of Israel:  These are the animals which you are to eat of all the living things of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Animals which you are to eat, etc. . .The prohibition of so many kinds of beasts, birds, and fishes, in the law, was ordered, 1st, to exercise the people in obedience, and temperance; 2ndly, to restrain them from the vices of which these animals were symbols; 3rdly, because the things here forbidden were for the most part unwholesome, and not proper to be eaten; 4thly, that the people of God, by being obliged to abstain from things corporally unclean, might be trained up to seek a spiritual cleanness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">11:3</span>. Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, you shall eat.<br/>
<br/>
Hoof divided, and cheweth the cud. . .The dividing of the hoof and chewing of the cud, signify discretion between good and evil, and meditating on the law of God; and where either of these is wanting a man is unclean.  In like manner fishes were reputed unclean that had not fins and scales:  that is, souls that did not raise themselves up by prayer and cover themselves with the scales of virtue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">11:4</span>. But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud, and hath a hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others:  that you shall not eat, but shall reckon it among the unclean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">11:5</span>. The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof, is unclean.<br/>
<br/>
The cherogrillus. . .Some suppose it to be the rabbit, others the hedgehog.  St. Jerome intimates that it is another kind of animal common in Palestine, which lives in the holes of rocks or in the earth.  We choose here, as also in the names of several other creatures that follow (which are little known in this part of the world,) to keep the Greek or Latin names.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">11:6</span>. The hare also:  for that too cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">11:7</span>. And the swine, which, though it divideth the hoof, cheweth not the cud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">11:8</span>. The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor shall you touch their carcasses, because they are unclean to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">11:9</span>. These are the things that breed in the waters, and which it is lawful to eat.  All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">11:10</span>. But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an abomination to you,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">11:11</span>. And detestable.  Their flesh you shall not eat:  and their carcasses you shall avoid.<br/>

<br/>
The griffon. . .Not the monster which the painter represent, which hath no being upon earth; but a bird of the eagle kind, larger than the common.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">11:14</span>. And the kite, and the vulture, according to their kind.<br/>

And upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall, it shall be defiled, whether it be a vessel of wood, or a garment, or skins or haircloths:  or any thing in which work is done.  They shall be dipped in water, and shall be unclean until the evening, and so afterwards shall be clean.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">13:13</span>. The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean:  because it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the man shall be clean.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-347">13:15</span>. Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the unclean.  For live flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">13:20</span>. And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white:  he shall declare him unclean, for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">13:29</span>. If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman, the priest shall see them,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">13:30</span>. And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than usual:  he shall declare them unclean, because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard;<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-368">13:36</span>. He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he is evidently unclean.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">13:40</span>. The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and clean:<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">13:51</span>. And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if he find that it is grown, it is a fixed leprosy.  He shall judge the garment unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">13:52</span>. And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">13:55</span>. And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean:  and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment, or through the whole.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">13:56</span>. But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after the garment is washed, he shall tear it off, and divide it from that which is sound.<br/>

<br/>
The rites of sacrifices in cleansing the leprosy.  Leprosy in houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">14:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">14:2</span>. This is the rite of a leper, when he is to be cleansed.  He shall be brought to the priest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">14:3</span>. Who going out of the camp, when he shall find that the leprosy is cleansed,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">14:4</span>. Shall command him that is to be purified, to offer for himself two living sparrows, which it is lawful to eat, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">14:5</span>. And he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated in an earthen vessel over living waters.<br/>
<br/>
Living waters. . .That is, waters taken from a spring, brook, or river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">14:6</span>. But the other that is alive, he shall dip, with the cedar wood, and the scarlet and the hyssop, in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">14:7</span>. Wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven times, that he may be rightly purified.  And he shall let go the living sparrow, that it may fly into the field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">14:8</span>. And when the man hath washed his clothes, he shall shave all the hair of his body, and shall be washed with water:  and being purified he shall enter into the camp, yet so that he tarry without his own tent seven days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">14:9</span>. And on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head, and his beard and his eyebrows, and the hair of all his body.  And having washed again his clothes, and his body,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">14:10</span>. On the eighth day, he shall take two lambs without blemish, and an ewe of a year old without blemish, and three tenths of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil apart.<br/>
<br/>
A sextary. . .Heb. log:  a measure of liquids, which was the twelfth part of a hin; and held about as much as six eggs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">14:11</span>. And when the priest that purifieth the man, hath presented him, and all these things before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">14:12</span>. He shall take a lamb, and offer it for a trespass offering with the sextary of oil.  And having offered all before the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">14:13</span>. He shall immolate the lamb, where the victim for sin is wont to be immolated, and the holocaust, that is, in the holy place.  For as that which is for sin, so also the victim for a trespass offering pertaineth to the priest:  it is holy of holies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">14:14</span>. And the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was immolated for trespass, shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot.<br/>
<br/>
Taking of the blood, etc. . .These ceremonies used in the cleansing of a leper, were mysterious and very significative.  The sprinkling seven times with the blood of the little bird, the washing himself and his clothes, the shaving his hair and his beard, signify the means which are to be used in the reconciliation of a sinner, and the steps by which he is to return to God, viz., by the repeated application of the blood of Christ:  the washing his conscience with the waters of compunction:  and retrenching all vanities and superfluities, by employing all that is over and above what is necessary in alms deeds. The sin offering, and the holocaust or burnt offering, which he was to offer at his cleansing, signify the sacrifice of a contrite and humble heart, and that of adoration in spirit and truth, with gratitude and thankfulness, for the forgiveness of sins, with which we are ever to appear before the Almighty.  The touching the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot, first with the blood of the victim, and then with the remainder of the oil, which had been sprinkled seven times before the Lord, signify the application of the blood of Christ, and the unction of the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost; to the sinner's right ear, that he may duly hearken to and obey the law of God; and to his right hand and foot, that the works of his hands, and all the steps or affections of his soul, signified by the feet, may be rightly directed to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">14:15</span>. And he shall pour of the sextary of oil into his own left hand,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">14:16</span>. And shall dip his right finger in it, and sprinkle it before the Lord seven times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">14:17</span>. And the rest of the oil in his left hand, he shall pour upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, and upon the blood that was shed for trespass:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">14:18</span>. And upon his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">14:19</span>. And he shall pray for him before the Lord, and shall offer the sacrifice for sin.  Then shall he immolate the holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">14:20</span>. And put it on the altar with the libations thereof:  and the man shall be rightly cleansed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">14:21</span>. But if he be poor, and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid:  he shall take a lamb for an offering for trespass, that the priest may pray for him, and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">14:22</span>. And two turtles or two young pigeons, of which one may be for sin, and the other for a holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">14:23</span>. And he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the priest, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">14:24</span>. And the priest receiving the lamb for trespass, and the sextary of oil, shall elevate them together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">14:25</span>. And the lamb being immolated, he shall put of the blood thereof upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">14:26</span>. But he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">14:27</span>. And dipping the finger of his right hand in it, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">14:28</span>. And he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, in the place of the blood that was shed for trespass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">14:29</span>. And the other part of the oil that is in his left hand, he shall pour upon the head of the purified person, that he may appease the Lord for him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">14:30</span>. And he shall offer a turtle, or young pigeon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">14:31</span>. One for trespass, and the other for a holocaust, with their libations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">14:32</span>. This is the sacrifice of a leper, that is not able to have all things that appertain to his cleansing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">14:33</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">14:36</span>. And he shall command, that they carry forth all things out of the house, before he go into it, and see whether it have the leprosy, let all things become unclean that are in the house.  And afterwards he shall go in to view the leprosy of the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">14:37</span>. And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little dints, disfigured with paleness or redness, and lower than all he rest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">14:38</span>. He shall go out of the door of the house, and forthwith shut it up seven days,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">14:39</span>. And returning on the seventh day, he shall look upon it.  If he find that the leprosy is spread,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">14:40</span>. He shall command, that the stones wherein the leprosy is, be taken out, and cast without the city into an unclean place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">14:41</span>. And that the house be scraped on the inside round about, and the dust of the scrapings be scattered without the city into an unclean place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">14:42</span>. And that other stones be laid in the place of them that were taken away, and the house be plastered with other mortar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">14:43</span>. But if after the stones be taken out, and the dust scraped off, and it be plastered with other earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">14:44</span>. The priest going in perceive that the leprosy is returned, and the walls full of spots, it is a lasting leprosy, and the house is unclean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">14:45</span>. And they shall destroy it forthwith, and shall cast the stones and timber thereof, and all the dust without the town into an unclean place.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">14:49</span>. And for the purification thereof he shall take two sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">14:52</span>. And shall purify it as well with the blood of the sparrow, as with the living water, and with the living sparrow, and with the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">14:53</span>. And when he hath let go the sparrow to fly freely away into the field, he shall pray for the house:  and it shall be rightly cleansed.<br/>

<br/>
When and how the high priest must enter into the sanctuary.  The feast of expiation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">16:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they were slain upon their offering strange fire:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-489">16:2</span>. And he commanded him, saying:  Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he enter not at all into the sanctuary, which is within the veil before the propitiatory, with which the ark is covered, lest he die, (for I will appear in a cloud over the oracle),<br/>
<br/>
Enter not. . .No one but the high priest, and he but once a year, could enter into the sanctuary; to signify that no one could enter into the sanctuary of heaven, till Christ our high priest opened it by his passion.  Heb. 10.8.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-490">16:3</span>. Unless he first do these things.  He shall offer a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-491">16:4</span>. He shall be vested with a linen tunick:  he shall cover his nakedness with linen breeches:  he shall be girded with a linen girdle, and he shall put a linen mitre upon his head.  For these are holy vestments:  all which he shall put on, after he is washed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">16:5</span>. And he shall receive from the whole multitude of the children of Israel two buck goats for sin, and one ram for a holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">16:6</span>. And when he hath offered the cattle and prayed for himself and for his own house:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-494">16:7</span>. He shall make the two buck goats to stand before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">16:8</span>. And casting lots upon them both, one to be offered to the Lord, and the other to be the emissary goat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">16:9</span>. That whose lot fell to be offered to the Lord, he shall offer for sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">16:10</span>. But that whose lot was to be the emissary goat, he shall present before the Lord, that he may pour prayers upon him, and let him go into the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">16:11</span>. After these things are duly celebrated, he shall offer the calf: and praying for himself and for his own house, he shall immolate it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">16:12</span>. And taking the censer, which he hath filled with the burning coals of the altar, and taking up with his hands the compounded perfume for incense, he shall go in within the veil into the holy place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">16:13</span>. That when the perfumes are put upon the fire, the cloud and vapour thereof may cover the oracle, which is over the testimony, and he may not die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">16:14</span>. He shall take also of the blood of the calf, and sprinkle with his finger seven times towards the propitiatory to the east.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">16:15</span>. And when he hath killed the buck goat for the sin of the people, he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil, as he was commanded to do with the blood of the calf, that he may sprinkle it over against the oracle:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">16:16</span>. And may expiate the sanctuary from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions, and all their sins. According to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle of the testimony, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">16:18</span>. And when he is come out to the altar that is before the Lord, let him pray for himself:  and taking the blood of the calf, and of the buck goat, let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">16:19</span>. And sprinkling with his finger seven times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">16:20</span>. After he hath cleaned the sanctuary, and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him offer the living goat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">16:21</span>. And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their offences and sins. And praying that they may light on its head, he shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">16:22</span>. And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the desert:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">16:24</span>. He shall wash his flesh in the holy place, and shall put on his own garments.  And after that he is come out and hath offered his own holocaust, and that of the people, he shall pray both for himself, and for the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">16:25</span>. And the fat that is offered for sins, he shall burn on the altar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">16:26</span>. But he that hath let go the emissary goat, shall wash his clothes, and his body with water, and so shall enter into the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">16:27</span>. But the calf and the buck goat, that were sacrificed for sin, and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary, to accomplish the atonement, they shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn with fire:  their skins and their flesh, and their dung.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">16:28</span>. And whosoever burneth them shall wash his clothes, and flesh with water:  and so shall enter into the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">16:29</span>. And this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance.  The seventh month, the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no work, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">16:30</span>. Upon this day shall be the expiation for you, and the cleansing from all your sins.  You shall be cleansed before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">16:31</span>. For it is a sabbath of rest:  and you shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">16:32</span>. And the priest that is anointed, and whose hands are consecrated to do the office of the priesthood in his father's stead, shall make atonement.  And he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy vestments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">16:33</span>. And he shall expiate the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar:  the priest also and all the people.<br/>
<br/>

No sacrifices to be offered but at the door of the tabernacle:  a prohibition of blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-524">17:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-525">17:2</span>. Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel, saying to them:  This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">17:3</span>. Any man whosoever of the house of Israel, if he kill an ox, or a sheep, or a goat in the camp, or without the camp,<br/>
<br/>
If he kill, etc. . .That is, in order to sacrifice.  The law of God forbids sacrifices to be offered in any other place but at the tabernacle or temple of the Lord; to signify that no sacrifice would be acceptable to God, out of his true temple, the one holy, catholic, apostolic church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">17:4</span>. And offer it not at the door of the tabernacle an oblation to the Lord, shall be guilty of blood.  As if he had shed blood, so shall he perish from the midst of his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">17:5</span>. Therefore the children of Israel shall bring to the priest their victims, which they kill in the field, that they may be sanctified to the Lord before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and they may sacrifice them for peace offerings to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">17:6</span>. And the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:  and shall burn the fat for a sweet odour to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">17:7</span>. And they shall no more sacrifice their victims to devils, with whom they have committed fornication.  It shall be an ordinance for ever to them and to their posterity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">17:8</span>. And thou shalt say to them:  The man of the house of Israel, and of the strangers who sojourn among you, that offereth a holocaust or a victim,<br/>

<br/>
Eat blood. . .To eat blood was forbidden in the law; partly, because God reserved it to himself, to be offered in sacrifices on the altar, as to the Lord of life and death; and as a figure of the blood of Christ; and partly, to give men a horror of shedding blood.  Gen. 9.4, 5, 6.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">17:11</span>. Because the life of the flesh is in the blood:  and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">17:14</span>. For the life of all flesh is in the blood.  Therefore I said to the children of Israel:  you shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all, because the life of the flesh is in the blood, and whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">17:15</span>. The soul that eateth that which died of itself, or has been caught by a beast, whether he be one of your own country or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and himself with water, and shall be defiled until the evening:  and in this manner he shall be made clean.<br/>

Holy days to be kept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">23:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">23:2</span>. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call holy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">23:3</span>. Six days shall ye do work:  the seventh day, because it is the rest of the sabbath, shall be called holy.  You shall do no work on that day:  it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your habitations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">23:4</span>. These also are the holy days of the Lord, which you must celebrate in their seasons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">23:5</span>. The first month, the fourteenth day of the month at evening, is the phase of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">23:11</span>. Who shall lift up the sheaf before the Lord, the next day after the sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you, and shall sanctify it.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">23:31</span>. You shall do no work therefore on that day:  it shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you in all your generations, and dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">23:32</span>. It is a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls beginning on the ninth day of the month.  From evening until evening you shall celebrate your sabbaths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">23:33</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">23:34</span>. Say to the children of Israel:  From the fifteenth day of this same seventh month, shall be kept the feast of tabernacles, seven days to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">23:35</span>. The first day shall be called most solemn and most holy:  you shall do no servile work therein.  And seven days you shall offer holocausts to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">23:36</span>. The eighth day also shall be most solemn and most holy:  and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord.  For it is the day of assembly and congregation.  You shall do no servile work therein.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">23:37</span>. These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call most solemn and most holy, and shall offer on them oblations to the Lord: holocausts and libations according to the rite of every day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">23:38</span>. Besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and your gifts, and those things that you offer by vow, or which you shall give to the Lord voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">23:39</span>. So from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you shall have gathered in all the fruits of your land, you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord seven days.  On the first day and the eighth shall be a sabbath:  that is a day of rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">23:40</span>. And you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of the fairest tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook:  And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">23:41</span>. And you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in the year. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations.  In the seventh month shall you celebrate this feast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">23:42</span>. And you shall dwell in bowers seven days.  Every one that is of the race of Israel, shall dwell in tabernacles:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">23:43</span>. That your posterity may know, that I made the children of Israel to dwell in tabernacles, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-776">25:3</span>. Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-777">25:4</span>. But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land, of the resting of the Lord.  Thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-778">25:5</span>. What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage. For it is a year of rest to the land.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-781">25:8</span>. Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years:  that is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-782">25:9</span>. And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.<br/>

<br/>
Remission. . .That is, a general release and discharge from debts and bondage, and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-800">25:27</span>. The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it.  And the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-801">25:28</span>. But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer shall have what he bought, until the year of the jubilee.  For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner, and to the ancient possessor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-802">25:29</span>. He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall have the liberty to redeem it, until one year be expired.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-803">25:30</span>. If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it cannot be redeemed, not even in the jubilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-804">25:31</span>. But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields.  If it be not redeemed before, in the jubilee it shall return to the owner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-805">25:32</span>. The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be redeemed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">25:33</span>. If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all return to the owners:  because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possessions among the children of Israel.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-832">26:2</span>. Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary.  I am the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">26:31</span>. Insomuch that I will bring your cities to be a wilderness:  and I will make your sanctuaries desolate:  and will receive no more your sweet odours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">26:32</span>. And I will destroy your land:  and your enemies shall be astonished at it, when they shall be the inhabitants thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">26:33</span>. And I will scatter you among the Gentiles:  and I will draw out the sword after you.  And your land shall be desert, and your cities destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">26:34</span>. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of her desolation.  When you shall be<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">26:35</span>. In the enemy's land, she shall keep a sabbath, and rest in the sabbaths of her desolation:  because she did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelt therein.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-866">26:36</span>. And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies.  The sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them:  and they shall flee as it were from the sword. They shall fall, when no man pursueth them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-867">26:37</span>. And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars:  none of you shall dare to resist your enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">26:38</span>. You shall perish among the Gentiles:  and an enemy's land shall consume you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">26:39</span>. And if of them also some remain, they shall pine away in their iniquities, in the land of their enemies:  and they shall be afflicted for the sins of their fathers, and their own.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">26:40</span>. Until they confess their iniquities, and the iniquities of their ancestors, whereby they have transgressed against me, and walked contrary unto me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">26:41</span>. Therefore I also will walk against them, and bring them into their enemies' land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed.  Then shall they pray for their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">26:42</span>. And I will remember my covenant, that I made with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham.  I will remember also the land:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">26:43</span>. Which when she shall be left by them, shall enjoy her sabbaths, being desolate for them.  But they shall pray for their sins, because they rejected my judgments, and despised my laws.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-874">26:44</span>. And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies, I did not cast them off altogether.  Neither did I so despise them that they should be quite consumed:  and I should make void my covenant with them.  For I am the Lord their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-875">26:45</span>. And I will remember my former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the Gentiles, to be their God.  I am the Lord.  These are the judgments, and precepts, and laws, which the Lord gave between him and the children of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">27:2</span>. Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  The man that shall have made a vow, and promised his soul to God, shall give the price according to estimation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-880">27:3</span>. If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old, he shall give fifty sicles of silver, after the weight of the sanctuary:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-881">27:4</span>. If a woman, thirty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">27:5</span>. But from the fifth year until the twentieth, a man shall give twenty sicles:  a woman ten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">27:6</span>. From one month until the fifth year, for a male shall be given five sicles:  for a female three.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">27:7</span>. A man that is sixty years old or upward, shall give fifteen sicles:  a woman ten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">27:8</span>. If he be poor, and not able to pay the estimation, he shall stand before the priest:  and as much as he shall value him at, and see him able to pay, so much shall he give.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">27:9</span>. But a beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord, if any one shall vow, shall be holy,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">27:10</span>. And cannot be changed:  that is to say, neither a better for a worse, nor a worse for a better.  And if he shall change it:  both that which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be consecrated to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-888">27:11</span>. An unclean beast, which cannot be sacrificed to the Lord, if any man shall vow, shall be brought before the priest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-889">27:12</span>. Who judging whether it be good or bad, shall set the price.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-890">27:13</span>. Which, if he that offereth it will give, he shall add above the estimation the fifth part.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-891">27:14</span>. If a man shall vow his house, and sanctify it to the Lord, the priest shall consider it, whether it be good or bad:  and it shall be sold according to the price, which he shall appoint.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-892">27:15</span>. But if he that vowed, will redeem it, he shall give the fifth part of the estimation over and above:  and shall have the house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-893">27:16</span>. And if he vow the field of his possession, and consecrate it to the Lord, the price shall be rated according to the measure of the seed.  If the ground be sown with thirty bushels of barley, let it be sold for fifty sicles of silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-894">27:17</span>. If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is beginning:  as much as it may be worth, at so much it shall be rated.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-895">27:18</span>. But if some time after, the priest shall reckon the money according to the number of years that remain until the jubilee, and the price shall be abated.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-896">27:19</span>. And if he that had vowed, will redeem his field, he shall add the fifth part of the money of the estimation, and shall possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-897">27:20</span>. And if he will not redeem it, but it be sold to any other man, he that vowed it, may not redeem it any more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-898">27:21</span>. For when the day of jubilee cometh, it shall be sanctified to the Lord, and as a possession consecrated, pertaineth to the right of the priest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-899">27:22</span>. If a field that was bought, and not of a man's ancestors' possession, be sanctified to the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-900">27:23</span>. The priest shall reckon the price according to the number of years, unto the jubilee.  And he that had vowed, shall give that to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-901">27:24</span>. But in the jubilee, it shall return to the former owner, who had sold it, and had it in the lot of his possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-902">27:25</span>. All estimation shall be made according to the sicle of the sanctuary.  A sicle hath twenty obols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-903">27:26</span>. The firstborn, which belong to the Lord, no man may sanctify and vow:  whether it be bullock, or sheep, they are the Lord's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-904">27:27</span>. And if it be an unclean beast, he that offereth it shall redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add the fifth part of the price.  If he will not redeem it, it shall be sold to another for how much soever it was estimated by thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-905">27:28</span>. Any thing that is devoted to the Lord, whether it be man, or beast, or field, shall not be sold:  neither may it be redeemed. Whatsoever is once consecrated shall be holy of holies to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-906">27:29</span>. And any consecration that is offered by man, shall not be redeemed, but dying shall die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-907">27:30</span>. All tithes of the land, whether of corn, or of the fruits of trees, are the Lord's, and are sanctified to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-908">27:31</span>. And if any man will redeem his tithes, he shall add the fifth part of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-909">27:32</span>. Of all the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and goats, that pass under the shepherd's rod, every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-910">27:33</span>. It shall not be chosen neither good nor bad, neither shall it be changed for another.  If any man change it:  both that which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be sanctified to the Lord, and shall not be redeemed.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-911">27:34</span>. These are the precepts which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.<br/>
