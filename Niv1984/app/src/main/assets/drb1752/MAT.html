<p>THE NEW TESTAMENT OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO SAINT MATTHEW<br/>
<br/>
Saint Matthew, one of the twelve Apostles, who from being a publican, that is, a taxgatherer, was called by our Saviour to the Apostleship: in that profession his name is Levi.  (Luke 5.27, and Mark 2.14.)  He was the first of the Evangelists that wrote the Gospel, and that in Hebrew or Syro-Chaldaic which the Jews in Palestine spoke at that time.  The original is not now extant; but it was translated in the time of the Apostles into Greek, that version was of equal authority.  He wrote about six years after the Lord's Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Matthew Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The genealogy of Christ:  he is conceived and born of a virgin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Abraham begot Isaac.  And Isaac begot Jacob.  And Jacob begot Judas and his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar.  And Phares begot Esron. And Esron begot Aram.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And Aram begot Aminadab.  And Aminadab begot Naasson.  And Naasson begot Salmon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab.  And Booz begot Obed of Ruth.  And Obed begot Jesse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And Jesse begot David the king.  And David the king begot Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Urias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And Solomon begot Roboam.  And Roboam begot Abia.  And Abia begot Asa.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. And Asa begot Josaphat.  And Josaphat begot Joram.  And Joram begot Ozias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And Ozias begot Joatham.  And Joatham begot Achaz.  And Achaz begot Ezechias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And Ezechias begot Manasses.  And Manasses begot Amon.  And Amon begot Josias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And after the transmigration of Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel.  And Salathiel begot Zorobabel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And Zorobabel begot Abiud.  And Abiud begot Eliacim.  And Eliacim begot Azor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And Azor begot Sadoc.  And Sadoc begot Achim.  And Achim begot Eliud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And Eliud begot Eleazar.  And Eleazar begot Mathan.  And Mathan begot Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br/>
<br/>
The husband of Mary. . .The Evangelist gives us rather the pedigree of St. Joseph, than that of the blessed Virgin, to conform to the custom of the Hebrews, who in their genealogies took no notice of women; but as they were near akin, the pedigree of the one sheweth that of the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. So all the generations from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations.  And from David to the transmigration of Babylon, are fourteen generations:  and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. Now the generation of Christ was in this wise.  When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. But while he thought on these things, behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying:  Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And she shall bring forth a son:  and thou shalt call his name Jesus.  For he shall save his people from their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. And he knew her not till she brought forth her first born son: and he called his name Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Till she brought forth her firstborn son. . .From these words Helvidius and other heretics most impiously inferred that the blessed Virgin Mary had other children besides Christ; but St. Jerome shews, by divers examples, that this expression of the Evangelist was a manner of speaking usual among the Hebrews, to denote by the word until, only what is done, without any regard to the future.  Thus it is said, Genesis 8. 6 and 7, that Noe sent forth a raven, which went forth, and did not return till the waters were dried up on the earth.  That is, did not return any more.  Also Isaias 46. 4, God says:  I am till you grow old.  Who dare infer that God should then cease to be:  Also in the first book of Machabees 5. 54, And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain till they had returned in peace.  That is, not one was slain before or after they had returned.  God saith to his divine Son:  Sit on my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool.  Shall he sit no longer after his enemies are subdued?  Yea and for all eternity.  St. Jerome also proves by Scripture examples, that an only begotten son, was also called firstborn, or first begotten:  because according to the law, the firstborn males were to be consecrated to God; Sanctify unto me, saith the Lord, every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, etc.  Ex. 13. 2.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-28"/>
</b><br/>
The offerings of the wise men:  the flight into Egypt:  the massacre of the Innocents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:1</span>. When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:2</span>. Saying:  Where is he that is born king of the Jews?  For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to adore him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:3</span>. And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:4</span>. And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:5</span>. But they said to him:  In Bethlehem of Juda.  For so it is written by the prophet:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:6</span>. And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda:  for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:7</span>. Then Herod, privately calling the wise men learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:8</span>. And sending them into Bethlehem, said:  Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come and adore him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:9</span>. Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the East, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:10</span>. And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:11</span>. And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him:  and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:12</span>. And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:13</span>. And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying:  Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt:  and be there until I shall tell thee.  For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:14</span>. Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt:  and he was there until the death of Herod:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:15</span>. That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:  Out of Egypt have I called my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:16</span>. Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding angry:  and sending killed all the menchildren that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:17</span>. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:18</span>. A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:19</span>. But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:20</span>. Saying:  Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel.  For they are dead that sought the life of the child.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:21</span>. Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:22</span>. But hearing that Archclaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither:  and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:23</span>. And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth:  that it might be fulfilled which was said by the prophets:  That he shall be called a Nazarene.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-53"/>
</b><br/>
The preaching of John:  Christ is baptized.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:1</span>. And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:2</span>. And saying:  Do penance:  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Do penance. . .Paenitentiam agite.  Which word, according to the use of the scriptures and the holy fathers, does not only signify repentance and amendment of life, but also punishing past sins by fasting, and such like penitential exercises.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:3</span>. For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying:  A voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:4</span>. And the same John had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins:  and his meat was locusts and wild honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:5</span>. Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:6</span>. And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:7</span>. And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them:  Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?<br/>
<br/>
Pharisees and Sadducees. . .These were two sects among the Jews:  of which the former were for the most part notorious hypocrites; the latter, a kind of freethinkers in matters of religion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:8</span>. Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:9</span>. And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father.  For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:10</span>. For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees.  Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:11</span>. I indeed baptize you in water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:12</span>. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:13</span>. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:14</span>. But John stayed him, saying:  I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:15</span>. And Jesus answering, said to him:  Suffer it to be so now.  For so it becometh us to fulfil all justice.  Then he suffered him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:16</span>. And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water:  and lo, the heavens were opened to him:  and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.<br/>
<br/>

Christ's fast of forty days:  He is tempted.  He begins to preach, to call disciples to him, and to work miracles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:1</span>. Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:2</span>. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:3</span>. And the tempter coming said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:4</span>. Who answered and said:  It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:5</span>. Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:6</span>. And said to him:  If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written:  That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:7</span>. Jesus said to him:  It is written again:  Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:8</span>. Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,<br/>
<br/>
Shewed him, etc. . .That is, pointed out to him where each kingdom lay; and set forth in words what was most glorious and admirable in each of them.  Or also set before his eyes, as it were in a large map, a lively representation of all those kingdoms.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:9</span>. And said to him:  All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt adore me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:10</span>. Then Jesus saith to him:  Begone, Satan:  for it is written:  The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:11</span>. Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:12</span>. And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired into Galilee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:13</span>. And leaving the city Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and of Nephthalim;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:14</span>. That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:18</span>. And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:19</span>. And he saith to them:  Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">5:18</span>. For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
Amen. . .That is, assuredly of a truth. . .This Hebrew word, amen, is here retained by the example and authority of all the four Evangelists. It is used by our Lord as a strong asseveration, and affirmation of the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">5:19</span>. He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments, and shall so teach men shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.  But he that shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">5:20</span>. For I tell you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
The scribes and Pharisees. . .The scribes were the doctors of the law of Moses:  the Pharisees were a precise set of men, making profession of a more exact observance of the law:  and upon that account greatly esteemed among the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">5:21</span>. You have heard that it was said to them of old:  Thou shalt not kill.  And whosoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Shall be in danger of the judgment. . .That is, shall deserve to be punished by that lesser tribunal among the Jews, called the Judgment, which took cognizance of such crimes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">5:22</span>. But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment.  And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council.  And whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.<br/>
<br/>
Raca. . .A word expressing great indignation or contempt.  Shall be in danger of the council. . .That is, shall deserve to be punished by the highest court of judicature, called the Council, or Sanhedrim, consisting of seventy-two persons, where the highest causes were tried and judged, which was at Jerusalem.  Thou fool. . .This was then looked upon as a heinous injury, when uttered with contempt, spite, or malice: and therefore is here so severely condemned.  Shall be in danger of hell fire. . .literally, according to the Greek, shall deserve to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.  Which words our Saviour made use of to express the fire and punishments of hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">5:23</span>. If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother hath anything against thee;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">5:24</span>. Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:25</span>. Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in the way with him:  lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:26</span>. Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence till thou repay the last farthing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:27</span>. You have heard that it was said to them of old:  Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:28</span>. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:29</span>. And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee.  For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than thy whole body be cast into hell.<br/>
<br/>
Scandalize thee. . .That is, if it be a stumblingblock, or occasion of sin to thee.  By which we are taught to fly the immediate occasions of sin, though they be as dear to us, or as necessary as a hand or an eye.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:30</span>. And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:  for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body go into hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:31</span>. And it hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:32</span>. But I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, excepting the cause of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery:  and he that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:33</span>. Again you have heard that it was said to them of old, thou shalt not forswear thyself:  but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">5:34</span>. But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven for it is the throne of God:<br/>
<br/>
Not to swear at all. . .It is not forbid to swear in truth, justice and judgment; to the honour of God, or our own or neighbour's just defence: but only to swear rashly, or profanely, in common discourse, and without necessity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">5:35</span>. Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool:  nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">5:36</span>. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">5:37</span>. But let your speech be yea, yea:  no, no:  and that which is over and above these, is of evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">5:38</span>. You have heard that it hath been said:  An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">5:39</span>. But I say to you not to resist evil:  but if one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other:<br/>
<br/>
Not to resist evil, etc. . .What is here commanded, is a Christian patience under injuries and affronts, and to be willing even to suffer still more, rather than to indulge the desire of revenge:  but what is further added does not strictly oblige according to the letter, for neither did Christ nor St. Paul turn the other cheek.  St. John 18., and Acts 23.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:40</span>. And if a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">5:41</span>. And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">5:42</span>. Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">5:43</span>. You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thy enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:44</span>. But I say to you, Love your enemies:  do good to them that hate you:  and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">5:45</span>. That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">5:46</span>. For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? do not even the publicans this?<br/>
<br/>
The publicans. . .These were the gatherers of the public taxes:  a set of men, odious and infamous among the Jews, for their extortions and injustice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">5:47</span>. And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more?  do not also the heathens this?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">5:48</span>. Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>

</b><br/>
A continuation of the sermon on the mount.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:1</span>. Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them:  otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Your justice. . .that is, works of justice; viz., fasting, prayer, and almsdeeds; which ought to be performed not out of ostentation, or a view to please men, but solely to please God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">6:2</span>. Therefore when thou dost an alms-deed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men.  Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:3</span>. But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:4</span>. That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:5</span>. And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men:  Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:6</span>. But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret, and thy father who seeth in secret will repay thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:7</span>. And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens.  For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:8</span>. Be not you therefore like to them for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">6:9</span>. Thus therefore shall you pray:  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">6:10</span>. Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">6:11</span>. Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.<br/>
<br/>
Supersubstantial bread. . .In St. Luke the same word is rendered daily bread.  It is understood of the bread of life, which we receive in the Blessed Sacrament.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:12</span>. And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:13</span>. And lead us not into temptation.  But deliver us from evil.  Amen.<br/>
<br/>
Lead us not into temptation. . .That is, suffer us not to be overcome by temptation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">6:14</span>. For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">6:15</span>. But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">6:16</span>. And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad.  For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.  Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">6:17</span>. But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">6:18</span>. That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret:  and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">6:19</span>. Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth:  where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through, and steal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">6:20</span>. But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven:  where neither the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">6:21</span>. For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">6:22</span>. The light of thy body is thy eye.  If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">6:23</span>. But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome.  If then the light that is in thee, be darkness:  the darkness itself how great shall it be!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">6:24</span>. No man can serve two masters.  For either he will hate the one, and love the other:  or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.<br/>
<br/>
Mammon. . .That is, riches, worldly interest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">6:25</span>. Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on.  Is not the life more than the meat:  and the body more than the raiment?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">6:26</span>. Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns:  and your heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are not you of much more value than they?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">6:27</span>. And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature one cubit?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">6:28</span>. And for raiment why are you solicitous?  Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow:  they labour not, neither do they spin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">6:29</span>. But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">6:30</span>. And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe:  how much more you, O ye of little faith?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">6:31</span>. Be not solicitous therefore, saying:  What shall we eat:  or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">6:32</span>. For after all these things do the heathens seek.  For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">6:33</span>. Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">6:34</span>. Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself.  Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">7:2</span>. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged:  and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">7:5</span>. Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">7:7</span>. Ask, and it shall be given you:  seek, and you shall find:  knock, and it shall be opened to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">7:8</span>. For every one that asketh, receiveth:  and he that seeketh, findeth:  and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">7:10</span>. Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">7:11</span>. If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children:  how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">7:12</span>. All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them.  For this is the law and the prophets.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">8:3</span>. And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying:  I will, be thou made clean.  And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">8:4</span>. And Jesus saith to him:  See thou tell no man:  but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">8:16</span>. And when evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils:  and he cast out the spirits with his word:  and all that were sick he healed:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">8:17</span>. That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet Isaias, saying:  He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">8:18</span>. And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to pass over the water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">8:19</span>. And a certain scribe came and said to him:  Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou shalt go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">8:20</span>. And Jesus saith to him:  The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">8:21</span>. And another of his disciples said to him:  Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">8:22</span>. But Jesus said to him:  Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">8:23</span>. And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">8:25</span>. And they came to him, and awaked him, saying:  Lord, save us, we perish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">8:26</span>. And Jesus saith to them:  Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith?  Then rising up, he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">8:27</span>. But the men wondered, saying:  What manner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">8:28</span>. And when he was come on the other side of the water, into the country of the Gerasens, there met him two that were possessed with devils, coming out of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce, so that none could pass by that way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">8:29</span>. And behold they cried out, saying:  What have we to do with thee, Jesus Son of God?  art thou come hither to torment us before the time?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">8:30</span>. And there was, not far from them, a herd of many swine feeding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">8:31</span>. And the devils besought him, saying:  If thou cast us out hence, send us into the herd of swine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">8:32</span>. And he said to them:  Go.  But they going out went into the swine, and behold the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea:  and they perished in the waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">8:33</span>. And they that kept them fled:  and coming into the city, told every thing, and concerning them that had been possessed by the devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">8:34</span>. And behold the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart from their coast.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 9<br id="bookmark-drb1752-252"/>

Christ heals one sick of palsy:  calls Matthew:  cures the issue of blood:  raises to life the daughter of Jairus:  gives sight to two blind men:  and heals a dumb man possessed by the devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">9:1</span>. And entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">9:2</span>. And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed.  And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">9:3</span>. And behold some of the scribes said within themselves:  He blasphemeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">9:4</span>. And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said:  Why do you think evil in your hearts?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">9:5</span>. Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee:  or to say, Arise, and walk?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">9:6</span>. But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">9:7</span>. And he arose, and went into his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">9:8</span>. And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">9:9</span>. And when Jesus passed on from thence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him:  Follow me.  And he arose up and followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">9:10</span>. And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">9:11</span>. And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples:  Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">9:12</span>. But Jesus hearing it, said:  They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">9:13</span>. Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.  For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">9:14</span>. Then came to him the disciples of John, saying:  Why do we and the Pharisees, fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">9:15</span>. And Jesus said to them:  Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.<br/>
<br/>
Can the children of the bridegroom. . .This, by a Hebraism, signifies the friends or companions of the bridegroom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">9:16</span>. And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment.  For it taketh away the fulness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">9:17</span>. Neither do they put new wine into old bottles.  Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish.  But new wine they put into new bottles:  and both are preserved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">9:18</span>. As he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying:  Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">9:19</span>. And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">9:20</span>. And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">9:21</span>. For she said within herself:  If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">9:22</span>. But Jesus turning and seeing her, said:  Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole.  And the woman was made whole from that hour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">9:23</span>. And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">9:24</span>. He said:  Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth.  And they laughed him to scorn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">9:25</span>. And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand.  And the maid arose.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">9:26</span>. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">9:27</span>. And as Jesus passed from thence, there followed him two blind men crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, O Son of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">9:28</span>. And when he was come to the house, the blind men came to him.  And Jesus saith to them, Do you believe, that I can do this unto you?  They say to him, Yea, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">9:29</span>. Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it done unto you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">9:30</span>. And their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know this.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">9:31</span>. But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">9:32</span>. And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb man, possessed with a devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">9:33</span>. And after the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the multitudes wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-286">9:34</span>. But the Pharisees said, By the prince of devils he casteth out devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">9:35</span>. And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every infirmity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">9:36</span>. And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them:  because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-289">9:37</span>. Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-340">11:4</span>. And Jesus making answer said to them:  Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-341">11:5</span>. The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor have the gospel preached to them.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-353">11:17</span>. Who crying to their companions say:  We have piped to you, and you have not danced:  we have lamented, and you have not mourned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-354">11:18</span>. For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say:  He hath a devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-355">11:19</span>. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say:  Behold a man that is a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners.  And wisdom is justified by her children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-356">11:20</span>. Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most of his miracles, for that they had not done penance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-357">11:21</span>. Woe thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida:  for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-358">11:22</span>. But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-359">11:23</span>. And thou Capharnaum, shalt thou be exalted up to heaven?  thou shalt go down even unto hell.  For if in Sodom had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in thee, perhaps it had remained unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-360">11:24</span>. But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-361">11:25</span>. At that time Jesus answered and said:  I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to little ones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-362">11:26</span>. Yea, Father:  for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-363">11:27</span>. All things are delivered to me by my Father.  And no one knoweth the Son but the Father:  neither doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-364">11:28</span>. Come to me all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">11:29</span>. Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart:  And you shall find rest to your souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-366">11:30</span>. For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.</p>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 12<br id="bookmark-drb1752-368"/>
</b><br/>
Christ reproves the blindness of the Pharisees, and confutes their attributing his miracles to Satan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-369">12:1</span>. At that time Jesus went through the corn on the sabbath:  and his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears, and to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">12:2</span>. And the Pharisees seeing them, said to him:  Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">12:3</span>. But he said to them:  Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">12:4</span>. How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were with him, but for the priests only?<br/>
<br/>
The loaves of proposition. . .So were called the twelve loaves which were placed before the sanctuary in the temple of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">12:5</span>. Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-374">12:6</span>. But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">12:7</span>. And if you knew what this meaneth:  I will have mercy, and not sacrifice:  you would never have condemned the innocent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">12:8</span>. For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">12:9</span>. And when he had passed from thence, he came into their synagogues.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">12:10</span>. And behold there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying:  Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?  that they might accuse him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">12:11</span>. But he said to them:  What man shall there be among you, that hath one sheep:  and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not take hold on it and lift it up?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">12:12</span>. How much better is a man than a sheep?  Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">12:13</span>. Then he saith to the man:  Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">12:14</span>. And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">12:15</span>. But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence:  and many followed him, and he healed them all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">12:16</span>. And he charged them that they should not make him known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">12:17</span>. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">12:18</span>. Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased.  I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">12:19</span>. He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">12:20</span>. The bruised reed he shall not break:  and smoking flax he shall not extinguish:  till he send forth judgment unto victory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">12:21</span>. And in his name the Gentiles shall hope.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">12:22</span>. Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb:  and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">12:23</span>. And all the multitudes were amazed, and said:  Is not this the son of David?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">12:24</span>. But the Pharisees hearing it, said:  This man casteth not out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">12:25</span>. And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to them:  Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate:  and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">12:26</span>. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself:  how then shall his kingdom stand?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">12:27</span>. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?  Therefore they shall be your judges.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">12:28</span>. But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">12:29</span>. Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his goods, unless he first bind the strong?  and then he will rifle his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">12:30</span>. He that is not with me, is against me:  and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">12:31</span>. Therefore I say to you:  Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.<br/>
<br/>
The blasphemy of the Spirit. . .The sin here spoken of is that blasphemy, by which the Pharisees attributed the miracles of Christ, wrought by the Spirit of God, to Beelzebub the prince of devils.  Now this kind of sin is usually accompanied with so much obstinacy, and such wilful opposing the Spirit of God, and the known truth, that men who are guilty of it, are seldom or never converted:  and therefore are never forgiven, because they will not repent.  Otherwise there is no sin, which God cannot or will not forgive to such as sincerely repent, and have recourse to the keys of the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">12:32</span>. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him:  but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come.<br/>
<br/>
Nor in the world to come. . .From these words St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei, lib. 21, c. 13) and St. Gregory (Dialog., 4, c. 39) gather, that some sins may be remitted in the world to come; and, consequently, that there is a purgatory or a middle place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">12:33</span>. Either make the tree good and its fruit good:  or make the tree evil, and its fruit evil.  For by the fruit the tree is known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">12:34</span>. O generation of vipers, how can you speak good things, whereas you are evil?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">12:35</span>. A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">12:36</span>. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Every idle word. . .This shews there must be a place of temporal punishment hereafter where these slighter faults shall be punished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">12:37</span>. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">12:38</span>. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master, we would see a sign from thee.<br/>
<br/>
A sign. . .That is, a miracle from heaven.  St. Luke 11. 16.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">12:39</span>. Who answering said to them:  An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign:  and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">12:40</span>. For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights:  so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.<br/>
<br/>
Three days, etc. . .Not complete days and nights; but part of three days, and three nights taken according to the way that the Hebrews counted their days and nights, viz., from evening to evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">12:41</span>. The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:  because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas.  And behold a greater than Jonas here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">12:42</span>. The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:  because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">12:43</span>. And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">12:44</span>. Then he saith:  I will return into my house from whence I came out.  And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">12:45</span>. Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:  and the last state of that man is made worse than the first.  So shall it be also to this wicked generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">12:46</span>. As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">12:47</span>. And one said unto him:  Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">12:48</span>. But he answering him that told him, said:  Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?<br/>
<br/>
Who is my mother?. . .This was not spoken by way of slighting his mother, but to shew that we are never to suffer ourselves to be taken from the service of God, by any inordinate affection to our earthly parents:  and that which our Lord chiefly regarded in his mother, was her doing the will of his Father in heaven.  It may also further allude to the reprobation of the Jews, his carnal kindred, and the election of the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">12:49</span>. And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">12:50</span>. For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.<br/>

The parables of the sower and the cockle:  of the mustardseed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">13:1</span>. The same day Jesus going out of the house, sat by the sea side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">13:2</span>. And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a boat and sat:  and all the multitude stood on the shore.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">13:3</span>. And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying:  Behold the sower went forth to sow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">13:4</span>. And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate them up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">13:5</span>. And other some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth:  and they sprung up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">13:6</span>. And when the sun was up they were scorched:  and because they had not root, they withered away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">13:7</span>. And others fell among thorns:  and the thorns grew up and choked them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">13:8</span>. And others fell upon good ground:  and they brought forth fruit, some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, and some thirty fold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">13:9</span>. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">13:10</span>. And his disciples came and said to him:  Why speakest thou to them in parables?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">13:11</span>. Who answered and said to them:  Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven:  but to them it is not given.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">13:12</span>. For he that hath, to him shall be given, and he shall abound: but he that hath not, from him shall be taken away that also which he hath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">13:13</span>. Therefore do I speak to them in parables:  because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">13:14</span>. And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them, who saith:  By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand:  and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">13:15</span>. For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears they have been dull of hearing, and their eyes they have shut:  lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">13:16</span>. But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">13:17</span>. For, amen, I say to you, many prophets and just men have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them:  and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">13:18</span>. Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">13:19</span>. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, there cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart:  this is he that received the seed by the way side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">13:20</span>. And he that received the seed upon stony ground, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">13:21</span>. Yet hath he not root in himself, but is only for a time:  and when there ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word, he is presently scandalized.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">13:22</span>. And he that received the seed among thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choketh up the word, and he becometh fruitless.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">13:23</span>. But he that received the seed upon good ground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one an hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">13:24</span>. Another parable he proposed to them, saying:  The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">13:25</span>. But while men were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">13:26</span>. And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">13:27</span>. And the servants of the good man of the house coming said to him.  Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field?  Whence then hath it cockle?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">13:28</span>. And he said to them:  An enemy hath done this.  And the servants said to him:  Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">13:29</span>. And he said:  No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">13:30</span>. Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers:  Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">13:31</span>. Another parable he proposed unto them, saying:  The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">13:32</span>. Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">13:33</span>. Another parable he spoke to them:  The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">13:34</span>. All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes:  and without parables he did not speak to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">13:35</span>. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:  I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">13:36</span>. Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying:  Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">13:37</span>. Who made answer and said to them:  He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-458">13:38</span>. And the field is the world.  And the good seed are the children of the kingdom.  And the cockle are the children of the wicked one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">13:39</span>. And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil.  But the harvest is the end of the world.  And the reapers are the angels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">13:40</span>. Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire:  so shall it be at the end of the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">13:41</span>. The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">13:42</span>. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire:  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">13:43</span>. Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father.  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">13:44</span>. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">13:45</span>. Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.<br/>
<br/>

Herod puts John to death.  Christ feeds five thousand in the desert.  He walks upon the sea, and heals all the diseased with the touch of his garment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">14:1</span>. At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Tetrarch. . .This word, derived from the Greek, signifies one that rules over the fourth part of a kingdom:  as Herod then ruled over Galilee, which was but the fourth part of the kingdom of his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">14:2</span>. And he said to his servants:  This is John the Baptist:  he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">14:3</span>. For Herod had apprehended John and bound him, and put him into prison, because of Herodias, his brother's wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">14:4</span>. For John said to him:  It is not lawful for thee to have her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">14:5</span>. And having a mind to put him to death, he feared the people: because they esteemed him as a prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">14:6</span>. But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them:  and pleased Herod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">14:7</span>. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">14:8</span>. But she being instructed before by her mother, said:  Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-489">14:9</span>. And the king was struck sad:  yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-490">14:10</span>. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-491">14:11</span>. And his head was brought in a dish:  and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">14:12</span>. And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and came and told Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">14:13</span>. Which when Jesus had heard, he retired from thence by a boat, into a desert place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot out of the cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-494">14:14</span>. And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, and healed their sick.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">14:15</span>. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying:  This is a desert place, and the hour is now passed:  send away the multitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">14:16</span>. But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go:  give you them to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">14:17</span>. They answered him:  We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">14:18</span>. Who said to them:  Bring them hither to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">14:19</span>. And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">14:20</span>. And they did all eat, and were filled.  And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">14:21</span>. And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women and children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">14:22</span>. And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">14:23</span>. And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to pray.  And when it was evening, he was there alone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">14:24</span>. But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">14:25</span>. And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking upon the sea.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">14:26</span>. And they seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an apparition.  And they cried out for fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">14:27</span>. And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying:  Be of good heart: it is I, fear ye not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">14:28</span>. And Peter making answer, said:  Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">14:29</span>. And he said:  Come.  And Peter going down out of the boat walked upon the water to come to Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">14:30</span>. But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid:  and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying:  Lord, save me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">14:31</span>. And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him:  O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">14:32</span>. And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">14:33</span>. And they that were in the boat came and adored him, saying: Indeed thou art the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">14:34</span>. And having passed the water, they came into the country of Genesar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">14:35</span>. And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent into all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">14:36</span>. And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment.  And as many as touched, were made whole.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 15<br id="bookmark-drb1752-518"/>
</b><br/>
Christ reproves the Scribes.  He cures the daughter of the woman of Canaan:  and many others:  and feeds four thousand with seven loaves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">15:1</span>. Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">15:2</span>. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-521">15:3</span>. But he answering, said to them:  Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?  For God said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-522">15:4</span>. Honour thy father and mother:  And:  He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">15:5</span>. But you say:  Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.<br/>
<br/>
The gift, etc. . .That is, the offering that I shall make to God, shall be instead of that which should be expended for thy profit.  This tradition of the Pharisees was calculated to enrich themselves; by exempting children from giving any further assistance to their parents, if they once offered to the temple and the priests, that which should have been the support of their parents.  But this was a violation of the law of God, and of nature, which our Saviour here condemns.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-524">15:6</span>. And he shall not honour his father or his mother:  and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-525">15:7</span>. Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">15:8</span>. This people honoureth me with their lips:  but their heart is far from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">15:9</span>. And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.<br/>
<br/>
Commandments of men. . .The doctrines and commandments here reprehended are such as are either contrary to the law of God, (as that of neglecting parents, under pretence of giving to God,) or at least are frivolous, unprofitable, and no ways conducing to true piety, as that of often washing hands, etc., without regard to the purity of the heart.  But as to the rules and ordinances of the holy church, touching fasts, festivals, etc., these are no ways repugnant to, but highly agreeable to God's holy word, and all Christian piety:  neither are they to be counted among the doctrines and commandments of men; because they proceed not from mere human authority; but from that which Christ has established in his church; whose pastors he has commanded us to hear and obey, even as himself.  St. Luke 10. 16; St. Matt. 18. 17.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">15:10</span>. And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them:  Hear ye and understand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">15:11</span>. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man:  but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<br/>
<br/>
Not that which goeth into, etc. . .No uncleanness in meat, nor any dirt contracted by eating it with unwashed hands, can defile the soul:  but sin alone; or a disobedience of the heart to the ordinance and will of God.  And thus when Adam took the forbidden fruit, it was not the apple, which entered into the mouth, but the disobedience to the law of God which defiled him.  The same is to be said if a Jew, in the time of the old law, had eaten swine's flesh; or a Christian convert, in the days of the apostles, contrary to their ordinance, had eaten blood; or if any of the faithful at present should transgress the ordinance of God's church, by breaking the fasts:  for in all these cases the soul would be defiled; not indeed by that which goeth into the mouth; but by the disobedience of the heart, in wilfully transgressing the ordinance of God, or of those who have their authority from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">15:12</span>. Then came his disciples, and said to him:  Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">15:13</span>. But he answering, said:  Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-532">15:14</span>. Let them alone:  they are blind, and leaders of the blind.  And if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-533">15:15</span>. And Peter answering, said to him:  Expound to us this parable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">15:16</span>. But he said:  Are you also yet without understanding?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-535">15:17</span>. Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-536">15:18</span>. But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">15:19</span>. For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">15:20</span>. These are the things that defile a man.  But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-539">15:21</span>. And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coast of Tyre and Sidon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">15:22</span>. And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him:  Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously troubled by a devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">15:23</span>. Who answered her not a word.  And his disciples came and besought him, saying:  Send her away, for she crieth after us:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">15:24</span>. And he answering, said:  I was not sent but to the sheep, that are lost of the house of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-543">15:25</span>. But she came and adored him, saying:  Lord, help me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-544">15:26</span>. Who answering, said:  It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-545">15:27</span>. But she said:  Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-546">15:28</span>. Then Jesus answering, said to her:  O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt:  and her daughter was cured from that hour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-547">15:29</span>. And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee:  and going up into a mountain, he sat there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-548">15:30</span>. And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others:  and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-549">15:31</span>. So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, the blind see:  and they glorified the God of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-550">15:32</span>. And Jesus called together his disciples, and said:  I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-551">15:33</span>. And the disciples say unto him:  Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-552">15:34</span>. And Jesus said to them:  How many loaves have you?  But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-553">15:35</span>. And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-554">15:36</span>. And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-555">15:37</span>. And they did all eat, and had their fill.  And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-556">15:38</span>. And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-560">16:1</span>. And there came to him the Pharisees and Sadducees tempting:  and they asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">16:8</span>. And Jesus knowing it, said:  Why do you think within yourselves, O ye of little faith, for that you have no bread?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-568">16:9</span>. Do you not yet understand, neither do you remember the five loaves among five thousand men, and how many baskets you took up?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">16:13</span>. And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi:  and he asked his disciples, saying:  Whom do men say that the Son of man is?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-577">16:18</span>. And I say to thee:  That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art Peter, etc. . .As St. Peter, by divine revelation, here made a solemn profession of his faith of the divinity of Christ; so in recompense of this faith and profession, our Lord here declares to him the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him:  viz., that he to whom he had already given the name of Peter, signifying a rock, St. John 1. 42, should be a rock indeed, of invincible strength, for the support of the building of the church; in which building he should be, next to Christ himself, the chief foundation stone, in quality of chief pastor, ruler, and governor; and should have accordingly all fulness of ecclesiastical power, signified by the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Upon this rock, etc. . .The words of Christ to Peter, spoken in the vulgar language of the Jews which our Lord made use of, were the same as if he had said in English, Thou art a Rock, and upon this rock I will build my church.  So that, by the plain course of the words, Peter is here declared to be the rock, upon which the church was to be built: Christ himself being both the principal foundation and founder of the same.  Where also note, that Christ, by building his house, that is, his church, upon a rock, has thereby secured it against all storms and floods, like the wise builder, St. Matt. 7. 24, 25. The gates of hell, etc. . .That is, the powers of darkness, and whatever Satan can do, either by himself, or his agents.  For as the church is here likened to a house, or fortress, built on a rock; so the adverse powers are likened to a contrary house or fortress, the gates of which, that is, the whole strength, and all the efforts it can make, will never be able to prevail over the city or church of Christ.  By this promise we are fully assured, that neither idolatry, heresy, nor any pernicious error whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the church of Christ.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">16:19</span>. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.  And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven:  and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Loose on earth. . .The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to sins, is called an indulgence; the power of which is here granted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">16:20</span>. Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">16:21</span>. From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the ancients and scribes and chief priests, and be put to death, and the third day rise again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">16:22</span>. And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him, saying:  Lord, be it far from thee, this shall not be unto thee.<br/>
<br/>
And Peter taking him. . .That is, taking him aside, out of a tender love, respect and zeal for his Lord and Master's honour, began to expostulate with him, as it were to rebuke him, saying, Lord, far be it from thee to suffer death; but the Lord said to Peter, ver. 23, Go behind me, Satan.  These words may signify, Begone from me; but the holy Fathers expound them otherwise, that is, come after me, or follow me; and by these words the Lord would have Peter to follow him in his suffering, and not to oppose the divine will by contradiction; for the word satan means in Hebrew an adversary, or one that opposes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">16:23</span>. Who turning, said to Peter:  Go behind me, Satan, thou art a scandal unto me:  because thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">16:24</span>. Then Jesus said to his disciples:  If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">16:25</span>. For he that will save his life, shall lose it:  and he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall find it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">16:26</span>. For what doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul?  Or what exchange shall a man give for his soul?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">16:27</span>. For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels:  and then will he render to every man according to his works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">16:28</span>. Amen I say to you, there are some of them that stand here, that shall not taste death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-590">17:1</span>. And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-593">17:4</span>. And Peter answering, said to Jesus:  Lord, it is good for us to be here:  if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-594">17:5</span>. And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them.  And lo a voice out of the cloud, saying:  This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:  hear ye him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-595">17:6</span>. And the disciples hearing fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-596">17:7</span>. And Jesus came and touched them:  and said to them:  Arise, and fear not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-597">17:8</span>. And they lifting up their eyes, saw no one, but only Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-598">17:9</span>. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying:  Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-599">17:10</span>. And his disciples asked him, saying:  Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-600">17:11</span>. But he answering, said to them:  Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-601">17:12</span>. But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, But have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind.  So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-602">17:13</span>. Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-603">17:14</span>. And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him saying:  Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much:  for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-607">17:18</span>. Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said:  Why could not we cast him out?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-608">17:19</span>. Jesus said to them:  Because of your unbelief.  For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain:  Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove:  and nothing shall be impossible to you.<br/>
<br/>
As a grain of mustard seed. . .That is, a perfect faith; which in its properties, and its fruits, resembles the grain of mustard seed, in the parable, chap. 13. 31.<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 18<br id="bookmark-drb1752-617"/>
</b><br/>
Christ teaches humility, to beware of scandal, and to flee the occasions of sin:  to denounce to the church incorrigible sinners, and to look upon such as refuse to hear the church as heathens.  He promises to his disciples the power of binding and loosing:  and that he will be in the midst of their assemblies.  No forgiveness for them that will not forgive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">18:1</span>. At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying:  Who, thinkest thou, is the greater in the kingdom of heaven?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">18:2</span>. And Jesus, calling unto him a little child, set him in the midst of them.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">18:4</span>. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.<br/>

<br/>
Shall scandalize. . .That is, shall put a stumblingblock in their way, and cause them to fall into sin.<br/>

<br/>
Pence. . .The Roman penny was the eighth part of an ounce, that is, about sevenpence half-penny English.<br/>

Christ declares matrimony to be indissoluble:  he recommends the making one's self an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven; and parting with all things for him.  He shews the danger of riches, and the reward of leaving all to follow him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-655">19:1</span>. And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea, beyond Jordan.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">19:4</span>. Who answering, said to them:  Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning, made them male and female?  And he said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">19:5</span>. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-660">19:6</span>. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.  What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-661">19:7</span>. They say to him:  Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">19:8</span>. He saith to them:  Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives:  but from the beginning it was not so.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">19:9</span>. And I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.<br/>
<br/>
Except it be, etc. . .In the case of fornication, that is, of adultery, the wife may be put away:  but even then the husband cannot marry another as long as the wife is living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">19:10</span>. His disciples say unto him:  If the case of a man with his wife be so, it is not expedient to marry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-665">19:11</span>. Who said to them:  All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given.<br/>
<br/>
All men take not this word. . .That is, all receive not the gift of living singly and chastely, unless they pray for the grace of God to enable them to live so, and for some it may be necessary to that end to fast as well as pray:  and to those it is given from above.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">19:12</span>. For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mothers womb: and there are eunuchs, who were made so by men:  and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven.  He that can take, let him take it.<br/>
<br/>
There are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven. . .This text is not to be taken in the literal sense; but means, that there are such, who have taken a firm and commendable resolution of leading a single and chaste life, in order to serve God in a more perfect state than those who marry:  as St. Paul clearly shews.  1 Cor. 7. 37, 38.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-672">19:18</span>. He said to him:  Which?  And Jesus said:  Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">19:19</span>. Honour thy father and thy mother:  and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">19:22</span>. And when the young man had heard this word, he went away sad: for he had great possessions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">19:23</span>. Then Jesus said to his disciples:  Amen, I say to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">19:24</span>. And again I say to you:  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">19:25</span>. And when they had heard this, the disciples wondered much, saying:  Who then can be saved?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">19:26</span>. And Jesus beholding, said to them:  With men this is impossible: but with God all things are possible.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">19:27</span>. Then Peter answering, said to him:  Behold we have left all things, and have followed thee:  what therefore shall we have?<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 20<br id="bookmark-drb1752-686"/>
</b><br/>
The parable of the labourers in the vineyard.  The ambition of the two sons of Zebedee.  Christ gives sight to two blind men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">20:1</span>. The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">20:2</span>. And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">20:3</span>. And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">20:4</span>. And he said to them:  Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">20:5</span>. And they went their way.  And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">20:6</span>. But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them:  Why stand you here all the day idle?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">20:7</span>. They say to him:  Because no man hath hired us.  He saith to them: Go ye also into my vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">20:8</span>. And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward:  Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">20:9</span>. When therefore they were come that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">20:10</span>. But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more:  And they also received every man a penny.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">20:11</span>. And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">20:12</span>. Saying:  These last have worked but one hour.  and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">20:13</span>. But he answering said to one of them:  friend, I do thee no wrong:  didst thou not agree with me for a penny?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">20:14</span>. Take what is thine, and go thy way:  I will also give to this last even as to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">20:15</span>. Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will?  Is thy eye evil, because I am good?<br/>
<br/>
What I will. . .Viz., with my own, and in matters that depend on my own bounty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">20:16</span>. So shall the last be first and the first last.  For many are called but few chosen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">20:17</span>. And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart and said to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-704">20:18</span>. Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes:  and they shall condemn him to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-705">20:19</span>. And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified:  and the third day he shall rise again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">20:20</span>. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">20:21</span>. Who said to her:  What wilt thou?  She saith to him:  say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-708">20:22</span>. And Jesus answering, said:  You know not what you ask.  Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink?  They say to him:  We can.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-709">20:23</span>. He saith to them:  My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-710">20:24</span>. And the ten, hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-711">20:25</span>. But Jesus called them to him and said:  You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and that they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-712">20:26</span>. It shall not be so among you:  but whosoever is the greater among you, let him be your minister.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">20:27</span>. And he that will be first among you shall be your servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-714">20:28</span>. Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a redemption for many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-715">20:29</span>. And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-716">20:30</span>. And behold two blind men sitting by the way side heard that Jesus passed by.  And they cried out, saying:  O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">20:31</span>. And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace.  But they cried out the more, saying:  O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">20:32</span>. And Jesus stood and called them and said:  What will ye that I do to you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">20:33</span>. They say to him:  Lord, that our eyes be opened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-720">20:34</span>. And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes.  And immediately they saw and followed him.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 21<br id="bookmark-drb1752-722"/>
</b><br/>
Christ rides into Jerusalem upon an ass.  He casts the buyers and sellers out of the temple, curses the fig tree and puts to silence the priests and scribes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">21:1</span>. And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage, unto mount Olivet, then Jesus sent two disciples,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">21:2</span>. Saying to them:  Go ye into the village that is over against you: and immediately you shall find an ass tied and a colt with her.  Loose them and bring them to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">21:3</span>. And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them.  And forthwith he will let them go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">21:4</span>. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">21:5</span>. Tell ye the daughter of Sion:  Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt, the foal of her that is used to the yoke.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-728">21:6</span>. And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">21:7</span>. And they brought the ass and the colt and laid their garments upon them and made him sit thereon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">21:8</span>. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way:  and others cut boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-731">21:9</span>. And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying:  Hosanna to the son of David:  Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:  Hosanna in the highest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">21:10</span>. And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying:  Who is this?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">21:11</span>. And the people said:  This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">21:12</span>. And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the chairs of them that sold doves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">21:13</span>. And he saith to them:  It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">21:14</span>. And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple:  and he healed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">21:15</span>. And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying:  Hosanna to the son of David, were moved with indignation,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">21:16</span>. And said to him:  Hearest thou what these say?  And Jesus said to them:  Yea, have you never read:  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">21:17</span>. And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania and remained here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">21:18</span>. And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">21:19</span>. And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only.  And he saith to it:  May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.  And immediately the fig tree withered away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">21:20</span>. And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying:  How is it presently withered away?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">21:21</span>. And Jesus answering, said to them:  Amen, I say to you, if you shall have faith and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">21:22</span>. And all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing, you shall receive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">21:23</span>. And when he was come into the temple, there came to him, as he was teaching, the chief priests and ancients of the people, saying:  By what authority dost thou these things?  And who hath given thee this authority?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">21:24</span>. Jesus answering, said to them:  I also will ask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">21:25</span>. The baptism of John, whence was it?  From heaven or from men?  But they thought within themselves, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">21:26</span>. If we shall say, from heaven, he will say to us:  Why then did you not believe him?  But if we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the multitude:  for all held John as a prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">21:27</span>. And answering Jesus, they said:  We know not.  He also said to them:  Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">21:28</span>. But what think you?  A certain man had two sons:  and coming to the first, he said:  Son, go work to day in my vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">21:29</span>. And he answering, said:  I will not.  But afterwards, being moved with repentance, he went.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-752">21:30</span>. And coming to the other, he said in like manner.  And he answering said:  I go, Sir.  And he went not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-753">21:31</span>. Which of the two did the father's will?  They say to him:  The first.  Jesus saith to them:  Amen I say to you that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">21:32</span>. For John came to you in the way of justice:  and you did not believe him.  But the publicans and the harlots believed him:  but you, seeing it, did not even afterwards repent, that you might believe him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">21:33</span>. Hear ye another parable.  There was a man, an householder, who planted a vineyard and made a hedge round about it and dug in it a press and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a strange country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">21:34</span>. And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">21:35</span>. And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one and killed another and stoned another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">21:36</span>. Again he sent other servants, more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">21:37</span>. And last of all he sent to them his son, saying:  They will reverence my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">21:38</span>. But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves:  This is the heir:  come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">21:39</span>. And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard and killed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">21:40</span>. When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-763">21:41</span>. They say to him:  He will bring those evil men to an evil end and let out his vineyard to other husbandmen that shall render him the fruit in due season.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-764">21:42</span>. Jesus saith to them:  Have you never read in the Scriptures:  The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?  By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-765">21:43</span>. Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-766">21:44</span>. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken:  but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-767">21:45</span>. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-768">21:46</span>. And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him as a prophet.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 22<br id="bookmark-drb1752-770"/>
</b><br/>
The parable of the marriage feast.  Christ orders tribute to be paid to Caesar.  He confutes the Sadducees, shews which is the first commandment in the law and puzzles the Pharisees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-771">22:1</span>. And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-772">22:2</span>. The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who made a marriage for his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-773">22:3</span>. And he sent his servants to call them that were invited to the marriage:  and they would not come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-774">22:4</span>. Again he sent other servants, saying:  Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner:  my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready.  Come ye to the marriage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-775">22:5</span>. But they neglected and went their ways, one to his farm and another to his merchandise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-776">22:6</span>. And the rest laid hands on his servants and, having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-777">22:7</span>. But when the king had heard of it, he was angry:  and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-778">22:8</span>. Then he saith to his servants:  The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-779">22:9</span>. Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-780">22:10</span>. And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good:  and the marriage was filled with guests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-781">22:11</span>. And the king went in to see the guests:  and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-782">22:12</span>. And he saith to him:  Friend, how camest thou in hither not having on a wedding garment?  But he was silent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-783">22:13</span>. Then the king said to the waiters:  Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness.  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-784">22:14</span>. For many are called, but few are chosen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-785">22:15</span>. Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-786">22:16</span>. And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker and teachest the way of God in truth.  Neither carest thou for any man:  for thou dost not regard the person of men.<br/>
<br/>
The Herodians. . .That is, some that belonged to Herod, and that joined with him in standing up for the necessity of paying tribute to Caesar, that is, to the Roman emperor.  Some are of opinion that there was a sect among the Jews called Herodians, from their maintaining that Herod was the Messias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-787">22:17</span>. Tell us therefore what dost thou think?  Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-788">22:18</span>. But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said:  Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-789">22:19</span>. Shew me the coin of the tribute.  And they offered him a penny.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-790">22:20</span>. And Jesus saith to them:  Whose image and inscription is this?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-791">22:21</span>. They say to him:  Caesar's.  Then he saith to them:  Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-792">22:22</span>. And hearing this, they wondered and, leaving him, went their ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-793">22:23</span>. That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-794">22:24</span>. Saying:  Master, Moses said:  If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up issue to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-795">22:25</span>. Now there were with us seven brethren:  and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-796">22:26</span>. In like manner the second and the third and so on, to the seventh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-797">22:27</span>. And last of all the woman died also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-798">22:28</span>. At the resurrection therefore, whose wife of the seven shall she be?  For they all had her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-799">22:29</span>. And Jesus answering, said to them:  You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-800">22:30</span>. For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married, but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-801">22:31</span>. And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-802">22:32</span>. I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?  He is not the God of the dead but of the living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-803">22:33</span>. And the multitudes hearing it were in admiration at his doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-804">22:34</span>. But the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-805">22:35</span>. And one of them, a doctor of the law, asked him, tempting him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">22:36</span>. Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-807">22:37</span>. Jesus said to him:  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-808">22:38</span>. This is the greatest and the first commandment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-809">22:39</span>. And the second is like to this:  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-810">22:40</span>. On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-811">22:41</span>. And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-812">22:42</span>. Saying:  What think you of Christ?  Whose son is he?  They say to him:  David's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-813">22:43</span>. He saith to them:  How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-814">22:44</span>. The Lord said to my Lord:  Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-815">22:45</span>. If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 23<br id="bookmark-drb1752-818"/>
</b><br/>
Christ admonishes the people to follow the good doctrine, not the bad example of the scribes and Pharisees.  He warns his disciples not to imitate their ambition and denounces divers woes against them for their hypocrisy and blindness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">23:1</span>. Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">23:2</span>. Saying:  The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-821">23:3</span>. All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do:  but according to their works do ye not.  For they say, and do not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-822">23:4</span>. For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens and lay them on men's shoulders:  but with a finger of their own they will not move them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-823">23:5</span>. And all their works they do for to be seen of men.  For they make their phylacteries broad and enlarge their fringes.<br/>
<br/>
Phylacteries. . .that is, parchments, on which they wrote the ten commandments, and carried them on their foreheads before their eyes: which the Pharisees affected to wear broader than other men; so to seem more zealous for the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-824">23:6</span>. And they love the first places at feasts and the first chairs in the synagogues,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-825">23:7</span>. And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-826">23:8</span>. But be not you called Rabbi.  For one is your master:  and all you are brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-827">23:9</span>. And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Call none your father--Neither be ye called masters, etc. . .The meaning is that our Father in heaven is incomparably more to be regarded, than any father upon earth:  and no master to be followed, who would lead us away from Christ.  But this does not hinder but that we are by the law of God to have a due respect both for our parents and spiritual fathers, (1 Cor. 4. <span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-828">23:15</span>,) and for our masters and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-829">23:10</span>. Neither be ye called masters:  for one is your master, Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-830">23:11</span>. He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-831">23:12</span>. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled:  and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-832">23:13</span>. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men:  for you yourselves do not enter in and those that are going in, you suffer not to enter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-833">23:14</span>. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour the houses of widows, praying long prayers.  For this you shall receive the greater judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-834">23:15</span>. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte.  And when he is made, you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-835">23:16</span>. Woe to you, blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but he that shall swear by the gold of the temple is a debtor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-836">23:17</span>. Ye foolish and blind:  for whether is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-837">23:18</span>. And whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is a debtor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">23:19</span>. Ye foolish and blind:  for whether is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-839">23:20</span>. He therefore that sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by all things that are upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-840">23:21</span>. And whosoever shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-841">23:22</span>. And he that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by him that sitteth thereon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-842">23:23</span>. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you tithe mint and anise and cummin and have left the weightier things of the law:  judgment and mercy and faith.  These things you ought to have done and not to leave those undone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">23:24</span>. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-844">23:25</span>. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within you are full of rapine and uncleanness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-845">23:26</span>. Thou blind Pharisee, first make clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside may become clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">23:27</span>. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; because you are like to whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear to men beautiful but within are full of dead men's bones and of all filthiness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">23:28</span>. So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just:  but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">23:29</span>. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, that build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the just,<br/>
<br/>
Build the sepulchres, etc. . .This is not blamed, as if it were in itself evil to build or adorn the monuments of the prophets:  but the hypocrisy of the Pharisees is here taxed; who, whilst they pretended to honour the memory of the prophets, were persecuting even unto death the Lord of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">23:30</span>. And say:  If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">23:31</span>. Wherefore you are witnesses against yourselves, that you are the sons of them that killed the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">23:32</span>. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">23:33</span>. You serpents, generation of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of hell?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">23:34</span>. Therefore behold I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes:  and some of them you will put to death and crucify:  and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">23:35</span>. That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just, even unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.<br/>
<br/>
That upon you may come, etc. . .Not that they should suffer more than their own sins justly deserved; but that the justice of God should now fall upon them with such a final vengeance, once for all, as might comprise all the different kinds of judgments and punishments, that had at any time before been inflicted for the shedding of just blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">23:36</span>. Amen I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">23:37</span>. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldst not?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">23:38</span>. Behold, your house shall be left to you, desolate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">23:39</span>. For I say to you, you shall not see me henceforth till you say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">24:3</span>. And when he was sitting on mount Olivet, the disciples came to him privately, saying:  Tell us when shall these things be?  And what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the consummation of the world?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-930">25:17</span>. And in like manner he that had received the two gained other two.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-931">25:18</span>. But he that had received the one, going his way, digged into the earth and hid his lord's money.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-932">25:19</span>. But after a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-933">25:20</span>. And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying:  Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents. Behold I have gained other five over and above.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-934">25:21</span>. His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things.  Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-935">25:22</span>. And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me.  Behold I have gained other two.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-936">25:23</span>. His lord said to him:  Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things.  Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-937">25:24</span>. But he that had received the one talent, came and said:  Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-938">25:25</span>. And being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the earth.  Behold here thou hast that which is thine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-939">25:26</span>. And his lord answering, said to him:  Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I have not strewed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-940">25:27</span>. Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers:  and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-941">25:28</span>. Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that hath ten talents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-942">25:29</span>. For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-943">25:30</span>. And the unprofitable servant, cast ye out into the exterior darkness.  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-944">25:31</span>. And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-945">25:32</span>. And all nations shall be gathered together before him:  and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-946">25:33</span>. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-947">25:34</span>. Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-948">25:35</span>. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat:  I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink:  I was a stranger, and you took me in:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-949">25:36</span>. Naked, and you covered me:  sick, and you visited me:  I was in prison, and you came to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-950">25:37</span>. Then shall the just answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see thee hungry and fed thee:  thirsty and gave thee drink?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-951">25:38</span>. Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in?  Or naked and covered thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-952">25:39</span>. Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-953">25:40</span>. And the king answering shall say to them:  Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-954">25:41</span>. Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-955">25:42</span>. For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat:  I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-956">25:43</span>. I was a stranger and you took me not in:  naked and you covered me not:  sick and in prison and you did not visit me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-957">25:44</span>. Then they also shall answer him, saying:  Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-958">25:45</span>. Then he shall answer them, saying:  Amen:  I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-959">25:46</span>. And these shall go into everlasting punishment:  but the just, into life everlasting.<br/>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 26<br id="bookmark-drb1752-961"/>
</b><br/>
The Jews conspire against Christ.  He is anointed by Mary.  The treason of Judas.  The last supper.  The prayer in the garden.  The apprehension of our Lord.  His treatment in the house of Caiphas.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-962">26:1</span>. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-963">26:2</span>. You know that after two days shall be the pasch:  and the Son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-964">26:3</span>. Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people, into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-965">26:4</span>. And they consulted together that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus and put him to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-966">26:5</span>. But they said:  Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-967">26:6</span>. And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-968">26:7</span>. There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment and poured it on his head as he was at table.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-969">26:8</span>. And the disciples seeing it had indignation, saying:  To what purpose is this waste?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-970">26:9</span>. For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-971">26:10</span>. And Jesus knowing it, said to them:  Why do you trouble this woman?  For she hath wrought a good work upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-972">26:11</span>. For the poor you have always with you:  but me you have not always.<br/>
<br/>
Me you have not always. . .Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-973">26:12</span>. For she in pouring this ointment on my body hath done it for my burial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-974">26:13</span>. Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-975">26:14</span>. Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-976">26:15</span>. And said to them:  What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you?  But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-977">26:16</span>. And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-978">26:17</span>. And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying:  Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?<br/>
<br/>
Azymes. . .Feast of the unleavened bread.  Pasch. . .The paschal lamb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-979">26:18</span>. But Jesus said:  Go ye into the city to a certain man and say to him:  The master saith, My time is near at hand.  With thee I make the pasch with my disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-980">26:19</span>. And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them:  and they prepared the pasch.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-981">26:20</span>. But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-982">26:21</span>. And whilst they were eating, he said:  Amen I say to you that one of you is about to betray me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-983">26:22</span>. And they being very much troubled began every one to say:  Is it I, Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-984">26:23</span>. But he answering said:  He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-985">26:24</span>. The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him.  But woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed.  It were better for him, if that man had not been born.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-986">26:25</span>. And Judas that betrayed him answering, said:  Is it I, Rabbi?  He saith to him:  Thou hast said it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-987">26:26</span>. And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread and blessed and broke and gave to his disciples and said:  Take ye and eat.  This is my body.<br/>
<br/>
This is my body. . .He does not say, This is the figure of my body--but This is my body.  (2 Council of Nice, Act. 6.)  Neither does he say in this, or with this is my body; but absolutely, This is my body:  which plainly implies transubstantiation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-988">26:27</span>. And taking the chalice, he gave thanks and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.<br/>
<br/>
Drink ye all of this. . .This was spoken to the twelve apostles; who were the all then present; and they all drank of it, says St. Mark 14. 23. But it no ways follows from these words spoken to the apostles, that all the faithful are here commanded to drink of the chalice; any more than that all the faithful are commanded to consecrate, offer and administer this sacrament; because Christ upon this same occasion, and at the same time, bid the apostles do so; in these words, St. Luke 22. 19, Do this for a commemoration of me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-989">26:28</span>. For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.<br/>
<br/>
Blood of the new testament. . .As the old testament was dedicated with the blood of victims, by Moses, in these words:  This is the blood of the testament, etc., Heb. 9. 20; so here is the dedication and institution of the new testament, in the blood of Christ, here mystically shed by these words:  This is the blood of the new testament, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-990">26:29</span>. And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.<br/>
<br/>
Fruit of the vine. . .These words, by the account of St. Luke <span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-991">26:22</span>. 18, were not spoken of the sacramental cup, but of the wine that was drunk with the paschal lamb.  Though the sacramental cup might also be called the fruit of the vine, because it was consecrated from wine, and retains the likeness, and all the accidents or qualities of wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-992">26:30</span>. And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-993">26:31</span>. Then Jesus saith to them:  All you shall be scandalized in me this night.  For it is written:  I will strike the shepherd:  and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.<br/>
<br/>
Scandalized in me, etc. . .Forasmuch as my being apprehended shall make you all run away and forsake me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-994">26:32</span>. But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-995">26:33</span>. And Peter answering, said to him:  Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-996">26:34</span>. Jesus said to him:  Amen I say to thee that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-997">26:35</span>. Peter saith to him:  Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee.  And in like manner said all the disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-998">26:36</span>. Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani.  And he said to his disciples:  Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-999">26:37</span>. And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1000">26:38</span>. Then he saith to them:  My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1001">26:39</span>. And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying and saying:  My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1002">26:40</span>. And he cometh to his disciples and findeth them asleep.  And he saith to Peter:  What?  Could you not watch one hour with me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1003">26:41</span>. Watch ye:  and pray that ye enter not into temptation.  The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1004">26:42</span>. Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying:  My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1005">26:43</span>. And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping:  for their eyes were heavy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1006">26:44</span>. And leaving them, he went again:  and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1007">26:45</span>. Then he cometh to his disciples and said to them:  Sleep ye now and take your rest.  Behold the hour is at hand:  and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1008">26:46</span>. Rise:  let us go.  Behold he is at hand that will betray me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1009">26:47</span>. As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1010">26:48</span>. And he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying:  Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he.  Hold him fast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1011">26:49</span>. And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said:  Hail, Rabbi.  And he kissed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1012">26:50</span>. And Jesus said to him:  Friend, whereto art thou come?  Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and held him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1013">26:51</span>. And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword:  and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1014">26:52</span>. Then Jesus saith to him:  Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1015">26:53</span>. Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1016">26:54</span>. How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1017">26:55</span>. In that same hour, Jesus said to the multitudes:  You are come out, as it were to a robber, with swords and clubs to apprehend me.  I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple:  and you laid not hands on me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1018">26:56</span>. Now all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.  Then the disciples, all leaving him, fled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1019">26:57</span>. But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1020">26:58</span>. And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest, And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1021">26:59</span>. And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1022">26:60</span>. And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1023">26:61</span>. And they said:  This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and after three days to rebuild it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1024">26:62</span>. And the high priest rising up, said to him:  Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1025">26:63</span>. But Jesus held his peace.  And the high priest said to him:  I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1026">26:64</span>. Jesus saith to him:  Thou hast said it.  Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1027">26:65</span>. Then the high priest rent his garments, saying:  He hath blasphemed:  What further need have we of witnesses?  Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1028">26:66</span>. What think you?  But they answering, said:  He is guilty of death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1029">26:67</span>. Then did they spit in his face and buffeted him.  And others struck his face with the palms of their hands,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1030">26:68</span>. Saying:  Prophesy unto us, O Christ.  Who is he that struck thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1031">26:69</span>. But Peter sat without in the court.  And there came to him a servant maid, saying:  Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1032">26:70</span>. But he denied before them all, saying:  I know not what thou sayest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1033">26:71</span>. And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him; and she saith to them that were there:  This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1034">26:72</span>. And again he denied with an oath:  I know not the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1035">26:73</span>. And after a little while, they came that stood by and said to Peter:  Surely thou also art one of them.  For even thy speech doth discover thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1036">26:74</span>. Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1037">26:75</span>. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said:  Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.  And going forth, he wept bitterly.<br/>

The continuation of the history of the passion of Christ.  His death and burial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1040">27:1</span>. And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1041">27:2</span>. And they brought him bound and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1042">27:3</span>. Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1043">27:4</span>. Saying:  I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.  But they said: What is that to us?  Look thou to it.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1045">27:6</span>. But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said:  It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.<br/>
<br/>
Corbona. . .A place in the temple where the people put in their gifts or offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1046">27:7</span>. And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1047">27:8</span>. For this cause that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1048">27:9</span>. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1049">27:10</span>. And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1050">27:11</span>. And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  Jesus saith to him:  Thou sayest it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1051">27:12</span>. And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1052">27:13</span>. Then Pilate saith to him:  Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1053">27:14</span>. And he answered him to never a word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1054">27:15</span>. Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1055">27:16</span>. And he had then a notorious prisoner that was called Barabbas.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1056">27:17</span>. They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said:  Whom will you that I release to You:  Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1057">27:18</span>. For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1058">27:19</span>. And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying:  Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1059">27:20</span>. But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas and make Jesus away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1060">27:21</span>. And the governor answering, said to them:  Whether will you of the two to be released unto you?  But they said:  Barabbas.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1061">27:22</span>. Pilate saith to them:  What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ?  They say all:  Let him be crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1062">27:23</span>. The governor said to them:  Why, what evil hath he done?  But they cried out the more, saying:  Let him be crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1063">27:24</span>. And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, taking water washed his hands before the people, saying:  I am innocent of the blood of this just man.  Look you to it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1064">27:25</span>. And the whole people answering, said:  His blood be upon us and upon our children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1065">27:26</span>. Then he released to them Barabbas:  and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1066">27:27</span>. Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1067">27:28</span>. And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1068">27:29</span>. And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand.  And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying:  Hail, King of the Jews.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1069">27:30</span>. And spitting upon him, they took the reed and struck his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1070">27:31</span>. And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1071">27:32</span>. And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon:  him they forced to take up his cross.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1072">27:33</span>. And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1073">27:34</span>. And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall.  And when he had tasted, he would not drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1074">27:35</span>. And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:  They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1075">27:36</span>. And they sat and watched him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1076">27:37</span>. And they put over his head his cause written:  THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1077">27:38</span>. Then were crucified with him two thieves:  one on the right hand and one on the left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1078">27:39</span>. And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1079">27:40</span>. And saying:  Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it:  save thy own self.  If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1080">27:41</span>. In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1081">27:42</span>. He saved others:  himself he cannot save.  If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross:  and we will believe him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1082">27:43</span>. He trusted in God:  let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said:  I am the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1083">27:44</span>. And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1084">27:45</span>. Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1085">27:46</span>. And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani?  That is, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1086">27:47</span>. And some that stood there and heard said:  This man calleth Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1087">27:48</span>. And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1088">27:49</span>. And the others said:  Let be.  Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1089">27:50</span>. And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1090">27:51</span>. And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom:  and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1091">27:52</span>. And the graves were opened:  and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1092">27:53</span>. And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city and appeared to many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1093">27:54</span>. Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying:  Indeed this was the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1094">27:55</span>. And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1095">27:56</span>. Among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1096">27:57</span>. And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1097">27:58</span>. He went to Pilate and asked the body of Jesus.  Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1098">27:59</span>. And Joseph taking the body wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1099">27:60</span>. And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock.  And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument and went his way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1100">27:61</span>. And there was there Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1101">27:62</span>. And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,<br/>
<br/>
The day of preparation. . .The eve of the sabbath; so called, because on that day they prepared all things necessary; not being allowed so much as to dress their meat on the sabbath day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1102">27:63</span>. Saying:  Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive:  After three days I will rise again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1103">27:64</span>. Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day:  lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away and say to the people:  He is risen from the dead.  And the last error shall be worse than the first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1104">27:65</span>. Pilate saith to them:  You have a guard.  Go, guard it as you know.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1105">27:66</span>. And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting guards.</p>

<p><b>Matthew Chapter 28<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1107"/>
</b><br/>
The resurrection of Christ.  His commission to his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1108">28:1</span>. And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1109">28:2</span>. And behold there was a great earthquake.  For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1110">28:3</span>. And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1111">28:4</span>. And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1112">28:5</span>. And the angel answering, said to the women:  Fear not you:  for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1113">28:6</span>. He is not here.  For he is risen, as he said.  Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1114">28:7</span>. And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen.  And behold he will go before you into Galilee.  There you shall see him.  Lo, I have foretold it to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1115">28:8</span>. And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1116">28:9</span>. And behold, Jesus met them, saying:  All hail.  But they came up and took hold of his feet and adored him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1117">28:10</span>. Then Jesus said to them:  Fear not.  Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee.  There they shall see me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1118">28:11</span>. Who when they were departed, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all things that had been done.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1119">28:12</span>. And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1120">28:13</span>. Saying:  Say you, His disciples came by night and stole him away when we were asleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1121">28:14</span>. And if the governor shall hear of this, we will persuade him and secure you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1122">28:15</span>. So they taking the money, did as they were taught:  and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1123">28:16</span>. And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1124">28:17</span>. And seeing him they adored:  but some doubted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1125">28:18</span>. And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying:  All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.<br/>
<br/>
All power, etc. . .See here the warrant and commission of the apostles and their successors, the bishops and pastors of Christ's church.  He received from his Father all power in heaven and in earth:  and in virtue of this power, he sends them (even as his Father sent him, St. John 20. 21) to teach and disciple, not one, but all nations; and instruct them in all truths:  and that he may assist them effectually in the execution of this commission, he promises to be with them, not for three or four hundred years only, but all days, even to the consummation of the world.  How then could the Catholic Church ever go astray; having always with her pastors, as is here promised, Christ himself, who is the way, the truth, and the life.  St. John 14.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1126">28:19</span>. Going therefore, teach ye all nations:  baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1127">28:20</span>. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.  And behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.<br/>
