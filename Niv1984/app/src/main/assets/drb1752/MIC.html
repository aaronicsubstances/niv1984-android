<p>THE PROPHECY OF MICHEAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
MICHEAS, of Morasti, a little town in the tribe of JUDA, was contemporary with the prophet ISAIAS:  whom he resembles both in his spirit and his style.  He is different from the prophet MICHEAS mentioned in the third book of Kings, chap. 22.  For that MICHEAS lived in the days of king ACHAB, one hundred and fifty years before the time of EZECHIAS, under whom this MICHEAS prophesied.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Micheas Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Samaria for her sins shall be destroyed by the Assyrians; they shall also invade Juda and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The word of the Lord, that came to Micheas, the Morasthite, in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda:  which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Hear, all ye people:  and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein:  and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place:  and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And the mountains shall be melted under him:  and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.  What is the wickedness of Jacob?  is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda?  are they not Jerusalem?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted:  and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols:  for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.<br/>
<br/>
Her wages. . .That is, her donaries or presents offered to her idols:  or the hire of all her traffic and labour.--Ibid.  Of the hire of a harlot, etc. . .They were gathered together by one idolatrous city, viz., Samaria:  and they shall be carried away to another idolatrous city, viz., Ninive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Therefore will I lament, and howl:  I will go stript and naked:  I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
It hath touched the gate, etc. . .That is, the destruction of Samaria shall be followed by the invasion of my people of Juda, and the Assyrians shall come and lay all waste even to the confines of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ye not with tears:  in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.<br/>
<br/>
Declare ye it not in Geth. . .Viz., amongst the Philistines, lest they rejoice at your calamity.--Ibid.  Weep ye not, etc. . .Keep in your tears, that you may not give your enemies an occasion of insulting over you; but in your own houses, or in your house of dust, your earthly habitation, sprinkle yourselves with dust, and put on the habit of penitents.  Some take the house of dust (in Hebrew, Aphrah) to be the proper name of a city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the beautiful place, covered with thy shame:  she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines:  the house adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.<br/>
<br/>
Thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, viz., in Samaria.  In the Hebrew the Beautiful place is expressed by the word Sapir, which some take for the proper name of a city.--Ibid.  She went not forth, etc. . .that is, they that dwelt in the confines came not forth, but kept themselves within, for fear.--Ibid.  The house adjoining, etc. . .Viz., Judea and Jerusalem, neighbours to Samaria, and partners in her sins, shall share also in her mourning and calamity; though they have pretended to stand by themselves, trusting in their strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness:  for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
She is become weak, etc. . .Jerusalem is become weak unto any good; because she dwells in the bitterness of sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
It is the beginning, etc. . .That is, Lachis was the first city of Juda that learned from Samaria the worship of idols, and communicated it to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore shall she send, etc. . .Lachis shall send to Geth for help: but in vain:  for Geth, instead of helping, shall be found to be a house of lying and deceit to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa:  even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.<br/>
<br/>
An heir, etc. . .Maresa (which was the name of a city of Juda) signifies inheritance:  but here God by his prophet tells the Jews, that he will bring them an heir to take possession of their inheritance:  and that the glory of Israel shall be obliged to give place, and to retire even to Odollam, a city in the extremity of their dominions.  And therefore he exhorts them to penance in the following verse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children:  enlarge thy baldness as the eagle:  for they are carried into captivity from thee.<br/>

<p><b>Micheas Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-19"/>
</b><br/>
The Israelites by their crying injustices provoke God to punish them. He shall at last restore Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:1</span>. Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and work evil in your beds:  in the morning light they execute it, because their hand is against God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:2</span>. And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and houses they have forcibly taken away:  and oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:3</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord:  Behold I devise an evil against this family:  from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:4</span>. In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say:  We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed:  how shall he depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?<br/>
<br/>
How shall he depart, etc. . .How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian is departing; when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his subjects?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:5</span>. Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Thou shalt have none, etc. . .Thou shalt have no longer any lot or inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:6</span>. Speak ye not, saying:  It shall not drop upon these, confusion shall not take them.<br/>
<br/>
It shall not drop, etc. . .That is, the prophecy shall not come upon these.  Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to believe the threats of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:7</span>. The house of Jacob saith:  Is the Spirit of the Lord straitened or are these his thoughts?  Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:8</span>. But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy:  you have taken away the cloak off from the coat:  and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.<br/>
<br/>
You have taken away, etc. . .You have even stripped people of their necessary garments:  and have treated such as were innocently passing on the way, as if they were at war with you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:9</span>. You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight:  you have taken my praise forever from their children.<br/>
<br/>
You have cast out, etc. . .either by depriving them of their houses:  or, by your crimes, given occasion to their being carried away captives, and their children, by that means, never learning to praise the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:10</span>. Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you.  For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:11</span>. Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie:  I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness:  and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.<br/>
<br/>
Would God, etc. . .The prophet could have wished, out of his love to his people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that were to fall upon them:  but by conforming himself to the will of God, he declares to them, that he is sent to prophesy, literally to let drop upon them, the wine of God's indignation, with which they should be made drunk; that is, stupified and cast down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:12</span>. I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob:  I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:13</span>. For he shall go up that shall open the way before them:  they shall divide and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it:  and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.<br/>

For the sins of the rich oppressing the poor, of false prophets flattering for lucre, and of judges perverting justice, Jerusalem and the temple shall be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">3:1</span>. And I said:  Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of the house of Israel:  Is it not your part to know judgment,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">3:2</span>. You that hate good, and love evil:  that violently pluck off their skins from them and their flesh from their bones?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">3:3</span>. Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin off them:  and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of the pot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">3:4</span>. Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them:  and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved wickedly in their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">3:5</span>. Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err:  that bite with their teeth, and preach peace:  and if a man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">3:6</span>. Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to you instead of divination:  and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be darkened over them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:7</span>. And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners shall be confounded:  and they shall all cover their faces, because there is no answer of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:8</span>. But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord, with judgment and power:  to declare unto Jacob his wickedness and to Israel his sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:9</span>. Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel:  you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right.<br/>

Daughter of the robber. . .Some understand this of Babylon; which robbed and pillaged the temple of God:  others understand it of Jerusalem; by reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there.<br/>

The Assyrian. . .That is, the persecutors of the church:  who are here called Assyrians by the prophet:  because the Assyrians were at that time the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of God.--Ibid. Seven shepherds, etc. . .Viz., the pastors of God's church, and the defenders of the faith.

<p><b>Micheas Chapter 7<br id="bookmark-drb1752-97"/>
</b><br/>
The prophet laments, that notwithstanding all his preaching, the generality are still corrupt in their manners:  therefore their desolation is at hand:  but they shall be restored again and prosper; and all mankind shall be redeemed by Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">7:1</span>. Woe is me, for I am become as one that gleaneth in autumn the grapes of the vintage:  there is no cluster to eat, my soul desired the first ripe figs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">7:2</span>. The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men:  they all lie in wait for blood, every one hunteth his brother to death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">7:3</span>. The evil of their hands they call good:  the prince requireth, and the judge is for giving:  and the great man hath uttered the desire of his soul, and they have troubled it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">7:4</span>. He that is best among them, is as a brier, and he that is righteous, as the thorn of the hedge.  The day of thy inspection, thy visitation cometh:  now shall be their destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">7:5</span>. Believe not a friend, and trust not in a prince:  keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">7:6</span>. For the son dishonoureth the father, and the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law:  and a man's enemies are they of his own household.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">7:7</span>. But I will look towards the Lord, I will wait for God, my saviour: my God will hear me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">7:8</span>. Rejoice not, thou my enemy, over me, because I am fallen:  I shall arise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">7:9</span>. I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him:  until he judge my cause, and execute judgement for me:  he will bring me forth into the light, I shall behold his justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">7:10</span>. And my enemy shall behold, and she shall be covered with shame, who saith to me:  Where is the Lord thy God?  my eyes shall look down upon her:  now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the streets.<br/>
<br/>
She shall be covered, etc. . .Viz., Babylon my enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">7:11</span>. The day shall come, that thy walls may be built up:  in that day shall the law be far removed.<br/>
<br/>
The law. . .Viz., of thy enemies, who have tyrannized over thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">7:12</span>. In that day they shall come even from Assyria to thee, and to the fortified cities:  and from the fortified cities even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">7:13</span>. And the land shall be made desolate because of the inhabitants thereof, and for the fruit of their devices.<br/>
<br/>
The land, etc. . .Viz., of Babylon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">7:14</span>. Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy inheritance, them that dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel:  they shall feed in Basan and Galaad, according to the days of old.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">7:15</span>. According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt, I will shew him wonders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">7:16</span>. The nations shall see, and shall be confounded at all their strength:  they shall put the hand upon the mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">7:17</span>. They shall lick the dust like serpents, as the creeping things of the earth, they shall be disturbed in their houses:  they shall dread the Lord, our God, and shall fear thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">7:18</span>. Who is a God like to thee, who takest away iniquity, and passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance?  he will send his fury in no more, because he delighteth in mercy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">7:19</span>. He will turn again, and have mercy on us:  he will put away our iniquities:  and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">7:20</span>. Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, the mercy to Abraham:  which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old.<br/>
