<p>THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
St. Mark, the disciple and interpreter of St. Peter (saith St. Jerome), according to what he heard from Peter himself, wrote at Rome a brief Gospel at the request of the Brethren, about ten years after our lord's Ascension; which when Peter had heard, he approved of it and with his authority published it to the church to be read.  Baronius and others say that the original was written in Latin:  but the more general opinion is that the Evangelist wrote it in Greek.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mark Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The preaching of John the Baptist.  Christ is baptized by him.  He calls his disciples and works many miracles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. As it is written in Isaias the prophet:  Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. A voice of one crying in the desert:  Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight his paths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And there went out to him all the country of Judea and all they of Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And John was clothed camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins:  and he ate locusts and wild honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. And he preached, saying:  There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. I have baptized you with water:  but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And there came a voice from heaven:  Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan.  And he was with beasts:  and the angels ministered to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came in Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And saying:  The time is accomplished and the kingdom of God is at hand.  Repent and believe the gospel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And Jesus said to them:  Come after me; and I will make you to become fishers of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. And forthwith he called them.  And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And they entered into Capharnaum:  and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. And they were astonished at his doctrine.  For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Saying:  What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?  Art thou come to destroy us?  I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. And Jesus threatened him, saying:  Speak no more, and go out of the man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying:  What thing is this?  What is this new doctrine?  For with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits:  and they obey him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever:  and forthwith they tell him of her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">1:32</span>. And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">1:33</span>. And all the city was gathered together at the door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">1:34</span>. And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases.  And he cast out many devils:  and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">1:35</span>. And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">1:36</span>. And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">1:37</span>. And when they had found him, they said to him:  All seek for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">1:38</span>. And he saith to them:  Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">1:39</span>. And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and casting out devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">1:40</span>. And there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down, said to him:  If thou wilt thou canst make me clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">1:41</span>. And Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him:  I will.  Be thou made clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">1:42</span>. And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him:  and he was made clean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">1:43</span>. And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">1:44</span>. And he saith to him:  See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">1:45</span>. But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word:  so that he could not openly go into the city.  but was without in desert places.  And they flocked to him from all sides.<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-48"/>
</b><br/>
Christ heals the sick of the palsy.  He calls Matthew and excuses his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:1</span>. And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:2</span>. And it was heard that he was in the house.  And many came together, so that there was no room:  no, not even at the door.  And he spoke to them the word.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:3</span>. And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:4</span>. And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was:  and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:5</span>. And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy:  Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:6</span>. And there were some of the scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:7</span>. Why doth this man speak thus?  He blasphemeth.  Who can forgive sins, but God only?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:8</span>. Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit that they so thought within themselves, saith to them:  Why think you these things in your hearts?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:9</span>. Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy:  Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say:  Arise, take up thy bed and walk?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:10</span>. But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy):<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">2:11</span>. I say to thee:  Arise.  Take up thy bed and go into thy house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">2:12</span>. And immediately he arose and, taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all:  so that all wondered and glorified God, saying:  We never saw the like.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">2:13</span>. And he went forth again to the sea side:  and all the multitude came to him.  And he taught them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">2:14</span>. And when he was passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him:  Follow me.  And rising up, he followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">2:15</span>. And it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house, many Publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they, with Jesus who also followed him.  For they were many, who also followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">2:16</span>. And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples:  Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">2:17</span>. Jesus hearing this, saith to them:  They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.  For I came not to call the just, but sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">2:18</span>. And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast.  And they come and say to him:  Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">2:19</span>. And Jesus saith to them:  Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them?  As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">2:20</span>. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them:  and then they shall fast in those days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">2:21</span>. No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment:  otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">2:22</span>. And no man putteth new wine into old bottles:  otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled and the bottles will be lost.  But new wine must be put into new bottles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">2:23</span>. And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward and to pluck the ears of corn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">2:24</span>. And the Pharisees said to him:  Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">2:25</span>. And he said to them:  Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, himself and they that were with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">2:26</span>. How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave to them who were with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">2:27</span>. And he said to them:  The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">2:28</span>. Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also.</p>

Christ heals the withered hand.  He chooses the twelve.  He confutes the blasphemy of the Pharisees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:1</span>. And he entered again into the synagogue:  and there was a man there who had a withered hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">3:2</span>. And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days, that they might accuse him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:3</span>. And he said to the man who had the withered hand:  Stand up in the midst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">3:4</span>. And he saith to them:  Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil?  To save life, or to destroy?  But they held their peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">3:5</span>. And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man:  Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth:  and his hand was restored unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">3:6</span>. And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">3:7</span>. But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">3:8</span>. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">3:9</span>. And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">3:10</span>. For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">3:11</span>. And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">3:12</span>. Thou art the Son of God.  And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">3:13</span>. And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself:  and they came to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">3:14</span>. And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">3:15</span>. And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">3:16</span>. And to Simon he gave the name Peter:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">3:17</span>. And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">3:18</span>. And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananean:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">3:19</span>. And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">3:20</span>. And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">3:21</span>. And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him.  For they said:  He is become mad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">3:22</span>. And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said:  He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">3:23</span>. And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables:  How can Satan cast out Satan?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">3:24</span>. And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<br/>

The parable of the sower.  Christ stills the tempest at sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">4:1</span>. And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship and sat in the sea:  and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:2</span>. And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">4:3</span>. Hear ye:  Behold, the sower went out to sow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">4:4</span>. And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">4:5</span>. And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">4:6</span>. And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">4:7</span>. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">4:8</span>. And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">4:9</span>. And he said:  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">4:10</span>. And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">4:11</span>. And he said to them:  To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God:  but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">4:12</span>. That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.<br/>
<br/>
That seeing they may see, etc. . .in punishment of their wilfully shutting their eyes, (St. Matt. 13. 15,) God justly withdrew those lights and graces, which otherwise he would have given them, for their effectual conversion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">4:13</span>. And he saith to them:  Are you ignorant of this, parable?  and how shall you know all parables?<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">4:15</span>. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">4:16</span>. And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">4:17</span>. And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time:  and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">4:18</span>. And others there are who are sown among thorns:  these are they that hear the word,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">4:19</span>. And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">4:20</span>. And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">4:21</span>. And he said to them:  Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed?  and not to be set on a candlestick?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">4:22</span>. For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">4:23</span>. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">4:24</span>. And he said to them:  Take heed what you hear.  In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">4:25</span>. For he that hath, to him shall be given:  and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">4:26</span>. And he said:  So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">4:27</span>. And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">4:28</span>. For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">4:29</span>. And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">4:30</span>. And he said:  To what shall we liken the kingdom of God?  or to what parable shall we compare it?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">4:31</span>. It is as a grain of mustard seed:  which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">4:32</span>. And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">4:33</span>. And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">4:34</span>. And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">4:35</span>. And he saith to them that day, when evening was come:  Let us pass over to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">4:36</span>. And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship:  and there were other ships with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">4:37</span>. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">4:38</span>. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him:  Master, doth, it not concern thee that we perish?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">4:39</span>. And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea:  Peace, be still.  And the wind ceased:  and there was made a great calm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">4:40</span>. And he said to them:  Why are you fearful?  have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly:  and they said one to another:  Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him?<br/>

Christ casts out a legion of devils:  he heals the issue of blood, and raises the daughter of Jairus to life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">5:1</span>. And they came over the strait of the sea, into the country of the Gerasens.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">5:2</span>. And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">5:3</span>. Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him, not even with chains.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">5:4</span>. For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">5:5</span>. And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">5:6</span>. And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">5:7</span>. And crying with a loud voice, he said:  What have I to do with thee, Jesus the Son of the most high God?  I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">5:8</span>. For he said unto him:  Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">5:9</span>. And he asked him:  What is thy name?  And he saith to him:  My name is Legion, for we are many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">5:10</span>. And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">5:11</span>. And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">5:12</span>. And the spirits besought him, saying:  Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">5:13</span>. And Jesus immediately gave them leave.  And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine:  and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, were stifled in the sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">5:14</span>. And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields.  And they went out to see what was done:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">5:15</span>. And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was troubled with the devil, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">5:16</span>. And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been dealt with who had the devil; and concerning the swine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">5:17</span>. And they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">5:18</span>. And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">5:19</span>. And he admitted him not, but saith him:  Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had mercy thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">5:20</span>. And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him:  and all men wondered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">5:21</span>. And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">5:22</span>. And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus: and seeing him, falleth down at his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">5:23</span>. And he besought him much, saying:  My daughter is at the point of death, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">5:24</span>. And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">5:25</span>. And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">5:26</span>. And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">5:27</span>. When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">5:28</span>. For she said:  If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">5:29</span>. And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">5:30</span>. And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said:  Who hath touched my garments?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">5:31</span>. And his disciples said to him:  Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">5:32</span>. And he looked about to see her who had done this.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">5:33</span>. But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">5:34</span>. And he said to her:  Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole:  go in peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">5:35</span>. While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying:  Thy daughter is dead:  why dost thou trouble the master any further?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">5:36</span>. But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue:  Fear not, only believe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-194">5:37</span>. And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">5:38</span>. And they cone to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">5:39</span>. And going in, he saith to them Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">5:40</span>. And they laughed him to scorn.  But he having put them all out, taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">5:41</span>. And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her:  Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted:  Damsel (I say to thee) arise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">5:42</span>. And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked:  and she was twelve years old:  and they were astonished with a great astonishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">5:43</span>. And he charged them strictly that no man should know it:  and commanded that something should be given her to eat.<br/>

Christ teaches at Nazareth:  he sends forth the twelve apostles:  he feeds five thousand with five loaves; and walks upon the sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">6:1</span>. And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his disciples followed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-204">6:2</span>. And when the Sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying:  How came this man by all these things?  and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-205">6:3</span>. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon?  are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in regard of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-206">6:4</span>. And Jesus said to them:  A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">6:5</span>. And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them.<br/>
<br/>
He could not. . .Not for want of power, but because he would not work miracles in favour of obstinate and incredulous people, who were unworthy of such favours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">6:6</span>. And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the villages round about teaching.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-209">6:7</span>. And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">6:8</span>. And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only; no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">6:9</span>. But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">6:10</span>. And he said to them:  Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">6:11</span>. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">6:12</span>. And going forth they preached men should do penance:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-215">6:13</span>. And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">6:14</span>. And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said:  John the Baptist is risen again from dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">6:15</span>. And others said:  It is Elias.  But others said:  It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">6:16</span>. Which Herod hearing, said:  John whom I beheaded, he is risen again from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">6:17</span>. For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">6:18</span>. For John said to Herod:  It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">6:19</span>. Now Herodias laid snares for him:  and was desirous to put him to death and could not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">6:20</span>. For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man:  and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things:  and he heard him willingly.<br/>
<br/>
And kept him. . .That is, from the designs of Herodias; and for fear of the people, would not put him to death, though she sought it; and through her daughter she effected her wish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">6:21</span>. And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">6:22</span>. And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in, and had danced, and pleased Herod, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel:  Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">6:23</span>. And he swore to her:  Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">6:24</span>. Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? But her mother said:  The head of John the Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">6:25</span>. And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying:  I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">6:26</span>. And the king was struck sad.  Yet because of his oath, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">6:27</span>. But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">6:28</span>. And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish:  and gave to the damsel, and the damsel gave it her mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">6:29</span>. Which his disciples hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">6:30</span>. And the apostles coming together unto Jesus, related to him all things that they had done and taught.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">6:31</span>. And he said to them:  Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little.  For there were many coming and going:  and they had not so much as time to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">6:32</span>. And going up into a ship, they went into a desert place apart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">6:33</span>. And they saw them going away, and many knew:  and they ran flocking thither foot from all the cities, and were there before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">6:34</span>. And Jesus going out saw a great multitude:  and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">6:35</span>. And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying:  This is a desert place, and the hour is now past:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">6:36</span>. Send them away, that going into the next villages and towns, they may buy themselves meat to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">6:37</span>. And he answering said to them:  Give you them to eat.  And they said to him:  Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">6:38</span>. And he saith to them:  How many loaves have you?  go and see.  And when they knew, they say:  Five, and two fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">6:39</span>. And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">6:40</span>. And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">6:41</span>. And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before them:  and the two fishes he divided among them all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">6:42</span>. And they all did eat, and had their fill.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">6:43</span>. And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">6:44</span>. And they that did eat, were five thousand men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">6:45</span>. And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship, that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida, whilst he dismissed the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">6:46</span>. And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to pray,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">6:47</span>. And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">6:48</span>. And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">6:49</span>. But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">6:50</span>. For they all saw him, and were troubled bled.  And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them:  Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">6:51</span>. And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased:  and they were far more astonished within themselves:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">6:52</span>. For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">6:53</span>. And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">6:54</span>. And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">6:55</span>. And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">6:56</span>. And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment:  and as many as touched him were made whole.<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 7<br id="bookmark-drb1752-260"/>
</b><br/>
Christ rebukes the Pharisees.  He heals the daughter of the woman of Chanaan; and the man that was deaf and dumb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">7:1</span>. And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">7:2</span>. And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">7:3</span>. For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">7:4</span>. And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not:  and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">7:5</span>. And the Pharisees and scribes asked him:  Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">7:6</span>. But he answering, said to them:  Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written:  This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">7:7</span>. And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.<br/>
<br/>
Doctrines and precepts of men. . .See the annotations, Matt. 15. 9, 11.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">7:8</span>. For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups:  and many other things you do like to these.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">7:9</span>. And he said to them:  Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">7:10</span>. For Moses said:  Honour thy father and thy mother.  And He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">7:11</span>. But you say:  If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban (which is a gift) whatsoever is from me shall profit thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">7:12</span>. And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">7:13</span>. Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth.  And many other such like things you do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">7:14</span>. And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them:  Hear ye me all and understand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">7:15</span>. There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him.  But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">7:16</span>. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">7:17</span>. And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">7:18</span>. And he saith to them:  So are you also without knowledge? Understand you not that every thing from without entering into a man cannot defile him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">7:19</span>. Because it entereth not into his heart but goeth into his belly and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">7:20</span>. But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">7:21</span>. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-282">7:22</span>. Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-283">7:23</span>. All these evil things come from within and defile a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">7:24</span>. And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it.  And he could not be hid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">7:25</span>. For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-286">7:26</span>. For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born.  And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">7:27</span>. Who said to her:  suffer first the children to be filled:  for it is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">7:28</span>. But she answered and said to him:  Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-289">7:29</span>. And he said to her:  For this saying, go thy way.  The devil is gone out of thy daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-290">7:30</span>. And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed and that the devil was gone out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-291">7:31</span>. And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst the of the coasts of Decapolis.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-292">7:32</span>. And they bring to him one deaf and dumb:  and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-293">7:33</span>. And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears:  and spitting, he touched his tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-294">7:34</span>. And looking up to heaven, he groaned and said to him:  Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-295">7:35</span>. And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-296">7:36</span>. And he charged them that they should tell no man.  But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-297">7:37</span>. And so much the more did they wonder, saying:  He hath done all things well.  He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.<br/>

Christ feeds four thousand.  He gives sight to a blind man.  He foretells his passion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-300">8:1</span>. In those days again, when there was great multitude and they had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-301">8:2</span>. I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-302">8:3</span>. And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way:  for some of them came from afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-303">8:4</span>. And his disciples answered him:  From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-304">8:5</span>. And he asked them:  How many loaves have ye?  Who said:  Seven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-305">8:6</span>. And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground.  And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke and gave to his disciples for to set before them.  And they set them before the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-306">8:7</span>. And they had a few little fishes:  and he blessed them and commanded them to be set before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-307">8:8</span>. And they did eat and were filled:  and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-308">8:9</span>. And they that had eaten were about four thousand.  And he sent them away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-309">8:10</span>. And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-310">8:11</span>. And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-311">8:12</span>. And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith:  Why doth this generation seek a sign?  Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-312">8:13</span>. And leaving them, he went up again into the ship and passed to the other side of the water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-313">8:14</span>. And they forgot to take bread:  and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-314">8:15</span>. And he charged them saying:  Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-315">8:16</span>. And they reasoned among themselves, saying:  Because we have no bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-316">8:17</span>. Which Jesus knowing, saith to them:  Why do you reason, because you have no bread?  Do you not yet know nor understand?  Have you still your heart blinded?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-317">8:18</span>. Having eyes, see you not?  And having ears, hear you not?  Neither do you remember?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-321">8:22</span>. And they came to Bethsaida:  and they bring to him a blind man. And they besought him that he would touch him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-322">8:23</span>. And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town. And spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-323">8:24</span>. And looking up, he said:  I see men, as it were trees, walking.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-324">8:25</span>. After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes:  and he began to see and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-325">8:26</span>. And he sent him into his house, saying:  Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-326">8:27</span>. And Jesus went out, and his disciples into the towns of Caesarea Philippi.  And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them:  Whom do men say that I am?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-327">8:28</span>. Who answered him, saying:  John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others as one of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-331">8:32</span>. And he spoke the word openly.  And Peter taking him began to rebuke him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-338">8:39</span>. And he said to them:  Amen f say to you that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God coming in power.</p>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-344">9:4</span>. And Peter answering, said to Jesus:  Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.  And let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-345">9:5</span>. For he knew not what he said:  for they were struck with fear.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-348">9:8</span>. And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-349">9:9</span>. And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-360">9:20</span>. And he asked his father:  How long time is it since this hath happened unto him?  But he sad:  From his infancy.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-365">9:25</span>. And crying out and greatly tearing him, he went our of him.  And he became as dead, so that many said:  He is dead.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">9:31</span>. But they understood not the word:  and they were afraid to ask him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">9:32</span>. And they came to Capharnaum.  And when they were in the house, he asked them:  What did you treat of in the way?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">9:33</span>. But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-375">9:35</span>. And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them.  Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">9:36</span>. Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name receiveth me.  And whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me.<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 10<br id="bookmark-drb1752-391"/>
</b><br/>
Marriage is not to be dissolved.  The danger of riches.  The ambition of the sons of Zebedee.  A blind man is restored to his sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">10:1</span>. And rising up from thence, he cometh into the coast of Judea beyond the Jordan:  and the multitude flocked to him again.  And as he was accustomed, he taught them again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">10:2</span>. And the Pharisees coming to him asked him, tempting him:  Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">10:3</span>. But he answering, saith to them:  What did Moses command you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">10:4</span>. Who said:  Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce and to put her away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">10:5</span>. To whom Jesus answering, said:  Because of the hardness of your heart, he wrote you that precept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">10:6</span>. But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">10:7</span>. For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">10:8</span>. And they two shall be in one flesh.  Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">10:9</span>. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">10:10</span>. And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">10:11</span>. And he saith to them:  Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">10:12</span>. And if the wife shall put away her husband and be married to another, she committeth adultery.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">10:13</span>. And they brought to him young children, that he might touch them.  And the disciples rebuked them that brought them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">10:14</span>. Whom when Jesus saw, he was much displeased and saith to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not:  for of such is the kingdom of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">10:15</span>. Amen I say to you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter into it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">10:16</span>. And embracing them and laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">10:17</span>. And when he was gone forth into the way, a certain man, running up and kneeling before him, asked him:  Good Master, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">10:18</span>. And Jesus said to him:  Why callest thou me good?  None is good but one, that is God.<br/>
<br/>
None is good. . .Of himself entirely and essentially, but God alone; men may be good also, but only by participation of God's goodness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">10:19</span>. Thou knowest the commandments:  Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">10:20</span>. But he answering, said to him:  Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">10:21</span>. And Jesus, looking on him, loved him and said to him:  One thing is wanting unto thee.  Go, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor:  and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.  And come, follow me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">10:22</span>. Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful:  for he had great possessions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">10:23</span>. And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples:  How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">10:24</span>. And the disciples were astonished at his words.  But Jesus again answering, saith to them:  Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">10:25</span>. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">10:26</span>. Who wondered the more, saying among themselves:  Who then can be saved?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">10:27</span>. And Jesus looking on them, saith with men it is impossible; but not with God.  For all things are possible with God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">10:28</span>. And Peter began to say unto him:  Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">10:29</span>. Jesus answering said:  Amen I say to you, there is no man who hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">10:30</span>. Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now in this time:  houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions:  and in the world to come life everlasting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">10:31</span>. But many that are first shall be last:  and the last, first.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">10:32</span>. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem:  and Jesus went before them.  And they were astonished and following were afraid.  And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">10:33</span>. Saying:  Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes and ancients.  And they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">10:34</span>. And they shall mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him:  and the third day he shall rise again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">10:35</span>. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: Master, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">10:36</span>. But he said to them:  What would you that I should do for you?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">10:37</span>. And they said:  Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">10:38</span>. And Jesus said to them:  You know not what you ask.  Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">10:39</span>. But they said to him:  We can.  And Jesus saith to them:  You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of; and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized you shall be baptized.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">10:40</span>. But to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">10:41</span>. And the ten, hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and John.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">10:42</span>. But Jesus calling them, saith to them:  You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them:  and their princes have power over them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">10:43</span>. But it is not so among you:  but whosoever will be greater shall be your minister.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">10:44</span>. And whosoever will be first among you shall be the servant of all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">10:45</span>. For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto:  but to minister and to give his life a redemption for many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">10:46</span>. And they came to Jericho.  And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind man, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">10:47</span>. Who when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, began to cry out and to say:  Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">10:48</span>. And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more:  Son of David, have mercy on me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">10:49</span>. And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called.  And they call the blind man, saying to him:  Be of better comfort.  Arise, he calleth thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">10:50</span>. Who casting off his garment leaped up and came to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">10:51</span>. And Jesus answering, said to him:  What wilt thou that I should do to thee?  And the blind man said to him:  Rabboni.  That I may see.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">10:52</span>. And Jesus saith to him:  Go thy way.  Thy faith hath made thee whole.  And immediately he saw and followed him in the way.<br/>

Christ enters into Jerusalem upon an ass.  He curses the barren fig tree and drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">11:1</span>. And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">11:2</span>. And saith to them:  Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat.  Loose him and bring him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">11:3</span>. And if any man shall say to you:  What are you doing?  Say ye that the Lord hath need of him.  And immediately he will let him come hither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">11:4</span>. And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in the meeting of two ways.  And they loose him.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">11:5</span>. And some of them that stood there said to them:  What do you loosing the colt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">11:6</span>. Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them.  And they let him go with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">11:7</span>. And they brought the colt to Jesus.  And they lay their garments on him:  and he sat upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">11:8</span>. And many spread their garments in the way:  and others cut down boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">11:9</span>. And they that went before and they that followed cried, saying: Hosanna:  Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">11:10</span>. Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh:  Hosanna in the highest.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">11:12</span>. And the next day when they came out from Bethania, he was hungry.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">11:18</span>. Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him.  For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 12<br id="bookmark-drb1752-480"/>

The parable of the vineyard and husbandmen.  Caesar's right to tribute. The Sadducees are confuted.  The first commandment.  The widow's mite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">12:1</span>. And he began to speak to them in parables:  A certain man planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it to husbandmen:  and went into a far country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">12:2</span>. And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">12:3</span>. Who, having laid hands on him, beat and sent him away empty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">12:4</span>. And again he sent to them another servant:  and him they wounded in the head and used him reproachfully.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">12:5</span>. And again he sent another, and him they killed:  and many others, of whom some they beat, and others they killed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">12:6</span>. Therefore, having yet one son, most dear to him, he also sent him unto them last of all, saying:  They will reverence my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">12:7</span>. But the husbandmen said one to another:  This is the heir.  Come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">12:8</span>. And laying hold on him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-489">12:9</span>. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?  He will come and destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-490">12:10</span>. And have you not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-491">12:11</span>. By the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-492">12:12</span>. And they sought to lay hands on him:  but they feared the people. For they knew that he spoke this parable to them.  And leaving him, they went their way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-493">12:13</span>. And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians: that they should catch him in his words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-494">12:14</span>. Who coming, say to him:  Master, we know that thou art a true speaker and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth.  Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar?  Or shall we not give it?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-495">12:15</span>. Who knowing their wiliness, saith to them:  Why tempt you me? Bring me a penny that I may see it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-496">12:16</span>. And they brought it him.  And he saith to them:  Whose is this image and inscription?  They say to him, Caesar's.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-497">12:17</span>. And Jesus answering, said to them:  Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.  And they marvelled at him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-498">12:18</span>. And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection.  And they asked him, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-499">12:19</span>. Master, Moses wrote unto us that if any man's brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-500">12:20</span>. Now there were seven brethren:  and the first took a wife and died leaving no issue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-501">12:21</span>. And the second took her and died:  and neither did he leave any issue.  And the third in like manner.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-502">12:22</span>. And the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave issue.  Last of all the woman also died.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-503">12:23</span>. In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them?  For the seven had her to wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-504">12:24</span>. And Jesus answering, saith to them:  Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures nor the power of God?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-505">12:25</span>. For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-506">12:26</span>. And as concerning the dead that they rise again have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying:  I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-507">12:27</span>. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  You therefore do greatly err.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-508">12:28</span>. And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-509">12:29</span>. And Jesus answered him:  The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel:  the Lord thy God is one God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-510">12:30</span>. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind and with thy whole strength.  This is the first commandment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-511">12:31</span>. And the second is like to it:  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  There is no other commandment greater than these.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-512">12:32</span>. And the scribe said to him:  Well, Master, thou hast said in truth that there is one God and there is no other besides him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-513">12:33</span>. And that he should be loved with the whole heart and with the whole understanding and with the whole soul and with the whole strength.  And to love one's neighbour as one's self is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-514">12:34</span>. And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him:  Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.  And no man after that durst ask him any question.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-515">12:35</span>. And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple:  How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">12:36</span>. For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost:  The Lord said to my Lord:  Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">12:37</span>. David therefore himself calleth him Lord.  And whence is he then his son?  And a great multitude heard him gladly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">12:38</span>. And he said to them in his doctrine:  Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">12:39</span>. And to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues and to have the highest places at suppers:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">12:40</span>. Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer.  These shall receive greater judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-521">12:41</span>. And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury.  And many that were rich cast in much.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-522">12:42</span>. And there came a certain poor widow:  and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">12:43</span>. And calling his disciples together, he saith to them:  Amen I say to you, this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-524">12:44</span>. For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living.<br/>

Christ foretells the destruction of the temple and the signs that shall forerun the day of judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">13:1</span>. And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him:  Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-528">13:2</span>. And Jesus answering, said to him:  Seest thou all these great buildings?  There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-529">13:3</span>. And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-530">13:4</span>. Tell us, when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">13:5</span>. And Jesus answering, began to say to them:  Take heed lest any man deceive you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-532">13:6</span>. For many shall come in my name saying, I am he:  and they shall deceive many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-533">13:7</span>. And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be:  but the end is not yet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">13:8</span>. For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines.  These things are the beginning of sorrows.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-535">13:9</span>. But look to yourselves.  For they shall deliver you Up to councils:  and in the synagogues you shall be beaten:  and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-536">13:10</span>. And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-537">13:11</span>. And when they shall lead you and deliver you up, be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak:  but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye.  For it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-538">13:12</span>. And the brother shall betray his brother unto death, and the father his son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall work their death.<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 14<br id="bookmark-drb1752-565"/>
</b><br/>
The first part of the history of the passion of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-566">14:1</span>. Now the feast of the pasch and of the Azymes was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him and kill him.<br/>
<br/>
Azymes. . .That is, the feast of the unleavened bread.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-567">14:2</span>. But they said:  Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-568">14:3</span>. And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard.  And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-569">14:4</span>. Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said:  Why was this waste of the ointment made?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-570">14:5</span>. For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor.  And they murmured against her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-571">14:6</span>. But Jesus said:  Let her alone.  Why do You molest her?  She hath wrought a good work upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-572">14:7</span>. For the poor you have always with you:  and whensoever you will, you may do them good:  but me you have not always.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-573">14:8</span>. She hath done what she could:  she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-574">14:9</span>. Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-575">14:10</span>. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-576">14:11</span>. Who hearing it were glad:  and they promised him they would give him money.  And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-577">14:12</span>. Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him:  Whither wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">14:13</span>. And he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them:  Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water.  Follow him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">14:14</span>. And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">14:15</span>. And he will shew you a large dining room furnished.  And there prepare ye for us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">14:16</span>. And his disciples went their way and came into the city.  And they found as he had told them:  and they prepared the pasch.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">14:17</span>. And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">14:18</span>. And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith:  Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">14:19</span>. But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one by one:  Is it I?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">14:20</span>. Who saith to them:  One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">14:21</span>. And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him:  but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed.  It were better for him, if that man had not been born.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">14:22</span>. And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke and gave to them and said:  Take ye.  This is my body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-588">14:23</span>. And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-589">14:24</span>. And he said to them:  This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-590">14:25</span>. Amen I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-591">14:26</span>. And when they had sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-592">14:27</span>. And Jesus saith to them:  You will all be scandalized in my regard this night.  For it is written:  I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-593">14:28</span>. But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-594">14:29</span>. But Peter saith to him:  Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-595">14:30</span>. And Jesus saith to him:  Amen I say to thee, to-day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br/>
<br/>
Crow twice. . .The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing our Saviour spoke of; and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the first crowing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-596">14:31</span>. But he spoke the more vehemently:  Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee.  And in like manner also said they all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-597">14:32</span>. And they came to a farm called Gethsemani.  And he saith to his disciples:  Sit you here, while I pray.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-598">14:33</span>. And he taketh Peter and James and John with him:  and he began to fear and to be heavy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-599">14:34</span>. And he saith to them:  My soul is sorrowful even unto death.  Stay you here and watch.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-600">14:35</span>. And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground:  and he prayed that, if it might be, the hour might pass from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-601">14:36</span>. And he saith:  Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-602">14:37</span>. And he cometh and findeth them sleeping.  And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou?  Couldst thou not watch one hour?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-603">14:38</span>. Watch ye:  and pray that you enter not into temptation.  The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-604">14:39</span>. And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-605">14:40</span>. And when he returned, he found them again asleep (for their eyes were heavy):  and they knew not what to answer him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-606">14:41</span>. And he cometh the third time and saith to them:  Sleep ye now and take your rest.  It is enough.  The hour is come:  behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-607">14:42</span>. Rise up:  let us go.  Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-608">14:43</span>. And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve:  and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-609">14:44</span>. And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he.  Lay hold on him:  and lead him away carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-610">14:45</span>. And when he was come, immediately going up to him he saith: Hail, Rabbi!  And he kissed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-611">14:46</span>. But they laid hands on him and held him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-612">14:47</span>. And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest and cut off his ear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-613">14:48</span>. And Jesus answering, said to them:  Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-614">14:49</span>. I was daily with you in the temple teaching:  and you did not lay hands on me.  But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-615">14:50</span>. Then his disciples, leaving him, all fled away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-616">14:51</span>. And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body.  And they laid hold on him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-617">14:52</span>. But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-618">14:53</span>. And they brought Jesus to the high priest.  And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-619">14:54</span>. And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest.  And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-620">14:55</span>. And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death:  and found none.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">14:56</span>. For many bore false witness against him:  and their evidences were not agreeing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-622">14:57</span>. And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">14:58</span>. We heard him say, I Will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-624">14:59</span>. And their witness did not agree.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-625">14:60</span>. And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-626">14:61</span>. But he held his peace and answered nothing.  Again the high priest asked him and said to him:  Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">14:62</span>. And Jesus said to him:  I am.  And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-628">14:63</span>. Then the high priest rending his garments, saith:  What need we any further witnesses?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">14:64</span>. You have heard the blasphemy.  What think you?  Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">14:65</span>. And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him:  Prophesy.  And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">14:66</span>. Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">14:67</span>. And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith:  Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">14:68</span>. But he denied, saying:  I neither know nor understand what thou sayest.  And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-634">14:69</span>. And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by:  This is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-635">14:70</span>. But he denied again.  And after a, while they that stood by said again to Peter:  Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-636">14:71</span>. But he began o curse and to swear, saying:  I know not this man of whom you speak.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-637">14:72</span>. And immediately the cock crew again.  And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him:  Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me.  And he began to weep,<br/>

<p><b>Mark Chapter 15<br id="bookmark-drb1752-639"/>
</b><br/>
The continuation of the history of the passion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">15:1</span>. And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away and delivered him to Pilate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-641">15:2</span>. And Pilate asked him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?  But he answering, saith to him:  Thou sayest it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">15:3</span>. And the chief priests accused him in many things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">15:4</span>. And Pilate again asked him, saying:  Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-644">15:5</span>. But Jesus still answered nothing:  so that Pilate wondered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-645">15:6</span>. Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">15:7</span>. And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">15:8</span>. And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do as he had ever done unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">15:9</span>. And Pilate answered them and said:  Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-649">15:10</span>. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-650">15:11</span>. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-651">15:12</span>. And Pilate again answering, saith to them:  What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-652">15:13</span>. But they again cried out:  Crucify him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-653">15:14</span>. And Pilate saith to them:  Why, what evil hath he done?  But they cried out the more:  Crucify him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-654">15:15</span>. And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas:  and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-655">15:16</span>. And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace:  and they called together the whole band.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-656">15:17</span>. And they clothed him with purple:  and, platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">15:18</span>. And they began to salute him:  Hail, king of the Jews.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">15:19</span>. And they struck his head with a reed:  and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">15:20</span>. And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him:  and they led him out to crucify him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-660">15:21</span>. And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-661">15:22</span>. And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">15:23</span>. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh.  But he took it not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">15:24</span>. And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">15:25</span>. And it was the third hour:  and they crucified him.<br/>
<br/>
The third hour. . .The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were named from the hour from which they began; the first, third, sixth, and ninth hour.  Our Lord was crucified a little before noon; before the third hour had quite expired; but when the sixth hour was near at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-665">15:26</span>. And the inscription of his cause was written over:  THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">15:27</span>. And with him they crucify two thieves:  the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-667">15:28</span>. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith:  And with the wicked he was reputed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-668">15:29</span>. And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying:  Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days buildest it up again:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-669">15:30</span>. Save thyself, coming down from the cross.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-670">15:31</span>. In like manner also the chief priests, mocking, said with the scribes one to another:  He saved others; himself he cannot save.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-671">15:32</span>. Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.  And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-672">15:33</span>. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">15:34</span>. And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying:  Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani?  Which is, being interpreted:  My God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-674">15:35</span>. And some of the standers by hearing, said:  Behold he calleth Elias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-675">15:36</span>. And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying:  Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">15:37</span>. And Jesus, having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">15:38</span>. And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">15:39</span>. And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost.  said:  Indeed this man was the son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">15:40</span>. And there were also women looking on afar off:  among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and Salome,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">15:41</span>. Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">15:42</span>. And when evening was now come (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath),<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">15:43</span>. Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">15:44</span>. But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead.  And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">15:45</span>. And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">15:46</span>. And Joseph, buying fine linen and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock.  And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">15:47</span>. And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.</p>

Christ's resurrection and ascension.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">16:1</span>. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">16:2</span>. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.<br/>
<br/>
The sun being now risen. . .They set out before it was light, to go to the sepulchre; but the sun was risen when they arrived there.  Or, figuratively, the sun here spoken of is the sun of justice, Christ Jesus our Lord, who was risen before their coming.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">16:3</span>. And they said one to another:  Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">16:4</span>. And looking, they saw the stone rolled back.  For it was very great.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">16:5</span>. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe:  and they were astonished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">16:6</span>. Who saith to them:  Be not affrighted.  you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.  He is risen:  he is not here.  Behold the place where they laid him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">16:7</span>. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee.  There you shall see him, as he told you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">16:8</span>. But they going out, fled from the sepulchre:  for a trembling and fear had seized them.  And they said nothing to any man:  for they were afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">16:9</span>. But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen; out of whom he had cast seven devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">16:10</span>. She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">16:11</span>. And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">16:12</span>. And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">16:13</span>. And they going told it to the rest:  neither did they believe them.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">16:14</span>. At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table:  and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">16:15</span>. And he said to them:  Go ye into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature.<br/>
