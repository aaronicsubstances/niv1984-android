<p>THE BOOK OF NEHEMIAS, WHICH IS CALLED THE SECOND OF ESDRAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book takes its name from the writer, who was cupbearer to Artaxerxes (surnamed Longimanus) king of Persia, and was sent by him with a commission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.  It is also called the second book of Esdras; because it is a continuation of the history, begun by Esdras, of the state of the people of God after their return from captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2 Esdras Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Nehemias hearing the miserable state of his countrymen in Judea, lamenteth, fasteth, and prayeth to God for their relief.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias.  And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And they said to me:  They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days:  and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And I said:  I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants:  and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee:  I and my father's house have sinned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy servant, saying:  If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And these are thy servants, and thy people:  whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name:  and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man.  For I was the king's cupbearer.<br/>

Nehemias with commission from king Artaxerxes cometh to Jerusalem:  and exhorteth the Jews to rebuild the walls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">2:1</span>. And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king:  that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king:  and I was as one languishing away before his face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">2:2</span>. And the king said to me:  Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick?  this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart.  And I was seized with an exceeding great fear:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">2:3</span>. And I said to the king:  O king, live for ever:  why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">2:4</span>. Then the king said to me:  For what dost thou make request?  And I prayed to the God of heaven,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">2:5</span>. And I said to the king:  If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:6</span>. And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him:  For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return?  And it pleased the king, and he sent me:  and I fixed him a time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:7</span>. And I said to the king:  If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:8</span>. And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into.  And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:9</span>. And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters.  And the king had sent with me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:10</span>. And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:11</span>. And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:12</span>. And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:13</span>. And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:14</span>. And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:15</span>. And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:16</span>. But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:17</span>. Then I said to them:  You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire:  come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:18</span>. And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said:  Let us rise up, and build.  And their hands were strengthened in good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:19</span>. But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said:  What is this thing that you do?  are you going to rebel against the king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:20</span>. And I answered them, and said to them:  The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants:  let us rise up and build:  but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.<br/>

The building is carried on notwithstanding the opposition of their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">4:1</span>. And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry:  and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the Jews.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:2</span>. And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing?  Will the Gentiles let them alone?  will they sacrifice and make an end in a day?  are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:3</span>. Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said:  Let them build:  if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:4</span>. Hear thou our God, for we are despised:  turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:5</span>. Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:6</span>. So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof:  and the heart of the people was excited to work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:7</span>. And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:8</span>. And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:9</span>. And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:10</span>. And Juda said:  The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">4:11</span>. And our enemies said:  Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:12</span>. And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:13</span>. I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:14</span>. And I looked and rose up:  and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people:  be not afraid of them.  Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:15</span>. And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel.  And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:16</span>. And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:17</span>. Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded:  with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:18</span>. For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins.  And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:19</span>. And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people:  The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:20</span>. In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us:  our God will fight for us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:21</span>. And let us do the work:  and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:22</span>. At that time also I said to the people:  Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:23</span>. Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes:  only every man stripped himself when he was to be washed.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">5:1</span>. Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">5:2</span>. And there were some that said:  Our sons and our daughters are very many:  let us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">5:8</span>. And I said to them:  We, as you know, have redeemed according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles:  and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them?  And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">5:9</span>. And I said to them:  The thing you do is not good:  why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">5:10</span>. Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many:  let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">5:11</span>. Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses:  and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">5:12</span>. And they said:  We will restore, and we will require nothing of them:  and we will do as thou sayest.  And I called the priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">5:13</span>. Moreover I shook my lap, and said:  So may God shake every man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty.  And all the multitude said:  Amen.  And they praised God.  And the people did according to what was said.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">5:15</span>. But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sicles:  and their officers also oppressed the people.  But I did not so for the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">5:16</span>. Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">5:17</span>. The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">5:18</span>. And there was prepared for me day be day one ox, and six choice rams, besides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things:  yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor:  for the people were very much impoverished.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">5:19</span>. Remember me, O my God, for good according to all that I have done for this people.<br/>

The enemies seek to terrify Nehemias.  He proceedeth and finisheth the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">6:1</span>. And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">6:2</span>. Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying:  Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono.  But they thought to do me mischief.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">6:3</span>. And I sent messengers to them, saying:  I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">6:4</span>. And they sent to me according to this word, four times:  and I answered them after the same manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">6:5</span>. And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">6:6</span>. It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them:  for which end<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">6:7</span>. Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying:  There is a king in Judea.  The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">6:8</span>. And I sent to them, saying:  There is no such thing done as thou sayest:  but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">6:9</span>. For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off.  Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">6:10</span>. And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately.  And he said:  Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple:  and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">6:11</span>. And I said:  Should such a man as I flee?  and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life?  I will not go in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">6:12</span>. And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">6:13</span>. For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">6:14</span>. Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind:  and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">6:15</span>. But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">6:16</span>. And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">6:17</span>. Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">6:18</span>. For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">6:19</span>. And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him:  And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.<br/>

Esdras readeth the law before the people.  Nehemias comforteth them. They celebrate the feast of tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">8:1</span>. And the seventh month came:  and the children of Israel were in their cities.  And all the people were gathered together as one man to the street which is before the water gate, and they spoke to Esdras the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">8:2</span>. Then Esdras the priest brought the law before the multitude of men and women, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">8:3</span>. And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water gate, from the morning until midday, before the men, and the women, and all those that could understand:  and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">8:4</span>. And Esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood, which he had made to speak upon, and there stood by him Mathathias, and Semeia, and Ania, and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand:  and on the left, Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia and Mosollam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">8:5</span>. And Esdras opened the book before all the people:  for he was above all the people:  and when he had opened it, all the people stood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-215">8:6</span>. And Esdras blessed the Lord the great God:  and all the people answered, Amen, amen:  lifting up their hands:  and they bowed down, and adored God with their faces to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-216">8:7</span>. Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephtai, Odia, Maasia, Celtia, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the Levites, made silence among the people to hear the law:  and the people stood in their place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-217">8:8</span>. And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly and plainly to be understood:  and they understood when it was read.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">8:9</span>. And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and Esdras the priest and scribe, and the Levites who interpreted to all the people, said:  This is a holy day to the Lord our God:  do not mourn, nor weep:  for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">8:10</span>. And he said to them:  Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves:  because it is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad:  for the joy of the Lord is our strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">8:11</span>. And the Levites stilled all the people, saying:  Hold your peace, for the day is holy, and be not sorrowful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">8:12</span>. So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth:  because they understood the words that he had taught them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">8:13</span>. And on the second day the chiefs of the families of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Esdras the scribe, that he should interpret to them the words of the law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">8:14</span>. And they found written in the law, that the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in tabernacles, on the feast, in the seventh month:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">8:15</span>. And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying:  Go forth to the mount, and fetch branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to make tabernacles, as it is written.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">8:16</span>. And the people went forth, and brought.  And they made themselves tabernacles every man on the top of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">8:17</span>. And all the assembly of them that were returned from the captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles:  for since the days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not done so, until that day:  and there was exceeding great joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">8:18</span>. And he read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day till the last, and they kept the solemnity seven days, and in the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner.<br/>

<p><b>2 Esdras Chapter 9<br id="bookmark-drb1752-229"/>
</b><br/>
The people repent with fasting and sackcloth.  The Levites confess God's benefits, and the people's ingratitude:  they pray for them, and make a covenant with God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">9:1</span>. And in the four and twentieth day of the month the children of Israel came together with fasting and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">9:2</span>. And the seed of the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger:  and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">9:3</span>. And they rose up to stand:  and they read in the book of the law of the Lord their God, four times in the day, and four times they confessed, and adored the Lord their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">9:4</span>. And there stood up upon the step of the Levites, Josue, and Bani, and Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani:  and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">9:5</span>. And the Levites Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Oduia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said:  Arise, bless the Lord your God from eternity to eternity:  and blessed be the high name of thy glory with all blessing and praise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">9:6</span>. Thou thyself, O Lord alone, thou hast made heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all the host thereof:  the earth and all things that are in it:  the seas and all that are therein:  and thou givest life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">9:7</span>. Thou O Lord God, art he who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraham.<br/>
<br/>
The fire of the Chaldeans. . .The city of Ur in Chaldea, the name of which signifies fire.  Or out of the fire of the tribulations and temptations, to which he was there exposed.--The ancient Rabbins understood this literally, affirming that Abram was cast into the fire by the idolaters, and brought out by a miracle without any hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">9:8</span>. And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee:  and thou madest a covenant with him, to give him the land of the Chanaanite, of the Hethite, and of the Amorrhite, and of the Pherezite, and of the Jebusite, and of the Gergezite, to give it to his seed:  and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art just.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">9:9</span>. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt:  and thou didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">9:10</span>. And thou shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharao, and upon all his servants, and upon the people of his land:  for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them:  and thou madest thyself a name, as it is at this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">9:11</span>. And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land:  but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into mighty waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">9:12</span>. And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, that they might see the way by which they went.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">9:13</span>. Thou camest down also to mount Sinai, and didst speak with them from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of truth, ceremonies, and good precepts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">9:14</span>. Thou madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and didst prescribe to them commandments, and ceremonies, and the law by the hand of Moses thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">9:15</span>. And thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst, and thou saidst to them that they should go in, and possess the land, upon which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">9:16</span>. But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">9:17</span>. And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy wonders which thou hadst done for them.  And they hardened their necks, and gave the head to return to their bondage, as it were by contention.  But thou, a forgiving God, gracious, and merciful, longsuffering, and full of compassion, didst not forsake them.<br/>
<br/>
And gave the head. . .That is, they set their head, or were bent to return to Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">9:18</span>. Yea when they had made also to themselves a molten calf, and had said:  This is thy God, that brought thee out of Egypt:  and had committed great blasphemies:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">9:19</span>. Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in the desert:  the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way, and the pillar of fire by night to shew them the way by which they should go.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">9:20</span>. And thou gavest them thy good Spirit to teach them, and thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water for their thirst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">9:21</span>. Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and nothing was wanting to them:  their garments did not grow old, and their feet were not worn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">9:22</span>. And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst divide lots for them:  and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king of Hesebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">9:23</span>. And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">9:24</span>. And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Chanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">9:25</span>. And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods:  cisterns made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance:  and they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with delight in thy great goodness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">9:26</span>. But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs:  and they killed thy prophets, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee:  and they were guilty of great blasphemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">9:27</span>. And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them.  And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">9:28</span>. But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight: and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them.  Then they returned, and cried to thee:  and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">9:29</span>. And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law.  But they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them:  and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">9:30</span>. And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets:  and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">9:31</span>. Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them:  because thou art a merciful and gracious God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">9:32</span>. Now therefore our God, great, strong, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of Assur, until this day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">9:33</span>. And thou art just in all things that have come upon us:  because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">9:34</span>. Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">9:35</span>. And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">9:36</span>. Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen:  and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">9:37</span>. And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">9:38</span>. And because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign it.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-376">12:28</span>. And the sons of the singing men were gathered together out of the plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of Nethuphati,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">12:31</span>. And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give praise.  And they went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">12:36</span>. And they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the water gate eastward:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">12:37</span>. And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">12:38</span>. And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and even to the flock gate:  and they stood still in the watch gate.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">12:40</span>. And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">12:41</span>. And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer.  And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was their overseer:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">12:42</span>. And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and they rejoiced:  for God had made them joyful with great joy:  their wives also and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">12:43</span>. They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites:  for Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that assisted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">12:44</span>. And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">12:45</span>. For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">12:46</span>. And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the sons of Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
Sanctified. . .That is, they gave them that which by the law was set aside, and sanctified for their use.<br/>

Divers abuses are reformed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">13:1</span>. And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people:  and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">13:2</span>. Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned the curse into blessing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">13:3</span>. And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">13:4</span>. And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.<br/>
<br/>
Over this thing, etc. . .Or, he was faulty in this thing, or in this kind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">13:5</span>. And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">13:6</span>. But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">13:7</span>. And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">13:8</span>. And it seemed to me exceeding evil.  And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">13:9</span>. And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-406">13:10</span>. And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them:  and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-407">13:11</span>. And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said:  Why have we forsaken the house of God?  And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">13:12</span>. And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">13:13</span>. And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania:  for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">13:14</span>. Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">13:15</span>. In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day.  And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">13:16</span>. Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares:  and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">13:17</span>. And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them:  What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">13:18</span>. Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city?  And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">13:19</span>. And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke:  and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath:  and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">13:20</span>. So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem, once or twice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">13:21</span>. And I charged them, and I said to them:  Why stay you before the wall?  if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you.  And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">13:22</span>. I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day:  for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">13:23</span>. In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">13:24</span>. And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">13:25</span>. And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them.  And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">13:26</span>. Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing:  and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:  and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">13:27</span>. And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">13:28</span>. And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">13:29</span>. Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">13:30</span>. So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">13:31</span>. And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the firstfruits:  remember me, O my God, unto good.  Amen.<br/>
