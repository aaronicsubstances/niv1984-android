<p>THE BOOK OF NUMBERS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This fourth Book of Moses is called NUMBERS, because it begins with the numbering of the people.  The Hebrews, from its first words, call it VAIEDABBER.  It contains the transactions of the Israelites from the second month of the second year after their going out of Egypt, until the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year; that is, a history almost of thirty-nine years.<br/>
<br/>

He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an oblation for her, the tenth part of a measure of barley meal:  he shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frankincense upon it:  because it is a sacrifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out adultery.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">6:3</span>. They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that may make a man drunk.  They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape:  nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-351">8:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-352">8:2</span>. Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him:  When thou shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the south side.  Give orders therefore that the lamps look over against the north, towards the table of the loaves of proposition, over against that part shall they give light, towards which the candlestick looketh.<br/>

Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification. . .This was the holy water mixed with the ashes of the red cow, Num. 19., appointed for purifying all that were unclean.  It was a figure of the blood of Christ, applied to our souls by his holy sacraments.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">9:2</span>. Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time,<br/>
<br/>
Make the phase. . .That is, keep the paschal solemnity, and eat the paschal lamb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">9:3</span>. The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all the ceremonies and justifications thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">9:4</span>. And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">9:5</span>. And they made it in its proper time:  the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in mount Sinai.  The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">9:6</span>. But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man, who could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,<br/>
<br/>
Behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man, etc. . .That is, by having touched or come near a dead body, out of which the soul was departed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">9:7</span>. Said to them:  We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man.  Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">9:8</span>. And Moses answered them:  Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">9:9</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">9:10</span>. Say to the children of Israel:  The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">9:11</span>. In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">9:12</span>. They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">9:13</span>. But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season:  he shall bear his sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">9:14</span>. The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof.  The same ordinances shall be with you both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">9:15</span>. Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered it.  But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">9:17</span>. And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up, then the children of Israel marched forward:  and in the place where the cloud stood still, there they camped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">9:18</span>. At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle.  All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">9:19</span>. And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">9:20</span>. For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his commandment they took them down.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">9:21</span>. If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward:  and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">9:22</span>. But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not:  but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">9:23</span>. By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word they marched:  and kept the watches of the Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses.<br/>

<br/>
The people murmur and are punished with fire.  God appointeth seventy ancients for assistants to Moses.  They prophesy.  The people have their fill of flesh, but forthwith many die of the plague.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">11:1</span>. In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue.  And when the Lord heard it he was angry.  And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">11:2</span>. And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was swallowed up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">11:3</span>. And he called the name of that place, The burning:  for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them.<br/>
<br/>
The burning. . .Hebrew, Taberah.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">11:4</span>. For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel also being joined with them, and said:  Who shall give us flesh to eat?<br/>
<br/>
A mixt multitude. . .These were people that came with them out of Egypt, who were not of the race of Israel; who, by their murmuring, drew also the children of Israel to murmur:  this should teach us the danger of associating ourselves with the children of Egypt, that is, with the lovers and admirers of this wicked world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">11:5</span>. We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free cost:  the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">11:6</span>. Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">11:7</span>. Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.<br/>
<br/>
Bdellium. . .Bdellium, according to Pliny, 1.21, c. 9. was of the colour of a man's nail, white and bright.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">11:8</span>. And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">11:9</span>. And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">11:10</span>. Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent.  And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled:  to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">11:11</span>. And he said to the Lord:  Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? Wherefore do I not find favour before thee?  And why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">11:12</span>. Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me:  Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">11:13</span>. Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude?  They weep against me, saying:  Give us flesh that we may eat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-455">11:14</span>. I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-456">11:15</span>. But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great evils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">11:16</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people:  and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee,<br/>
<br/>
Seventy men. . .This was the first institution of the council or senate, called the Sanhedrin, consisting of seventy or seventy-two senators or counsellors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-458">11:17</span>. That I may come down and speak with thee:  and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">11:18</span>. And thou shalt say to the people:  Be ye sanctified:  to morrow you shall eat flesh:  for I have heard you say:  Who will give us flesh to eat?  It was well with us in Egypt.  That the Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">11:19</span>. Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">11:20</span>. But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying:  Why came we out of Egypt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">11:21</span>. And Moses said:  There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou:  I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">11:22</span>. Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food?  or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">11:23</span>. And the Lord answered him:  Is the hand of the Lord unable?  Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">11:24</span>. Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">11:25</span>. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men.  And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">11:26</span>. Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">11:27</span>. And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying:  Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">11:28</span>. Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and chosen out of many, said:  My lord Moses forbid them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">11:29</span>. But he said:  Why hast thou emulation for me?  O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">11:30</span>. And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">11:31</span>. And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">11:32</span>. The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">11:33</span>. As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed:  when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">11:34</span>. And that place was called, The graves of lust:  for there they buried the people that had lusted.  And departing from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.<br/>
<br/>
The graves of lust. . .Or, the sepulchres of concupiscence:  so called from their irregular desire of flesh.  In Hebrew, Kibroth.  Hattaavah.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-478">12:1</span>. And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his wife the Ethiopian,<br/>
<br/>
Ethiopian. . .Sephora the wife of Moses was of Madian, which bordered upon the land of Chus or Ethiopia:  where note, that the Ethiopia here spoken of is not that of Africa but that of Arabia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-479">12:2</span>. And they said:  Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only?  Hath he not also spoken to us in like manner?  And when the Lord heard this,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-480">12:3</span>. (For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth)<br/>
<br/>
Exceeding meek. . .Moses being the meekest of men, would not contend for himself; therefore, God inspired him to write here his own defence:  and the Holy Spirit, whose dictate he wrote, obliged him to declare the truth, though it was so much to his own praise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-481">12:4</span>. Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary:  Come out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant.  And when they were come out,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-482">12:5</span>. The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary.  And when they were come,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-483">12:6</span>. He said to them:  Hear my words:  if there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-484">12:7</span>. But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all my house:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-485">12:8</span>. For I speak to him mouth to mouth:  and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord.  Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-486">12:9</span>. And being angry with them he went away:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-487">12:10</span>. The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed:  and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy.  And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with leprosy,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-488">12:11</span>. He said to Moses:  I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-516">13:22</span>. And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-517">13:23</span>. And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac.  For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-518">13:24</span>. And forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon a lever.  They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-519">13:25</span>. Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-520">13:26</span>. And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-523">13:29</span>. But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and walled.  We saw there the race of Enac.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-525">13:31</span>. In the mean time Caleb, to still the murmuring of the people that rose against Moses, said:  Let us go up and possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-526">13:32</span>. But the others, that had been with him, said:  No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-527">13:33</span>. And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying:  The land which we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants:  the people, that we beheld are of a tall stature.<br/>
<br/>
Spoke ill, etc. . .These men, who by their misrepresentations of the land of promise, discouraged the Israelites from attempting the conquest of it, were a figure of worldlings, who, by decrying or misrepresenting true devotion, discourage Christians from seeking in earnest and acquiring so great a good, and thereby securing to themselves a happy eternity.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-531">14:1</span>. Therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night.<br/>

Would God that we had died in Egypt:  and would God we may die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away captives.

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-534">14:4</span>. And they said one to another:  Let us appoint a captain, and let us return into Egypt.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-540">14:10</span>. And when all the multitude cried out, and would have stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-541">14:11</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  How long will this people detract me?  how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-542">14:12</span>. I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume them:  but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier than this is.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-561">14:31</span>. But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in:  that they may see the land which you have despised.<br/>

Shall bear your fornication. . .That is, shall bear the punishment of your disloyalty to God, which in the scripture language is here called a fornication, in a spiritual sense.<br/>

Fringes. . .The Pharisees enlarged these fringes through hypocrisy, Matt. 23.5, to appear more zealous than other men for the law of God.<br/>

The schism of Core and his adherents:  their punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-621">16:1</span>. And behold Core the son of Isaar, the son of Caath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, and Hon the son of Pheleth of the children of Ruben,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-622">16:2</span>. Rose up against Moses, and with them two hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel, leading men of the synagogue, and who in the time of assembly were called by name.<br/>
<br/>
Rose up. . .The crime of these men, which was punished in so remarkable a manner, was that of schism, and of rebellion against the authority established by God in the church; and their pretending to the priesthood without being lawfully called and sent:  the same is the case of all modern sectaries.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-623">16:3</span>. And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron, they said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones, and the Lord is among them:  Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-624">16:4</span>. When Moses heard this, he fell flat on his face:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-625">16:5</span>. And speaking to Core and all the multitude, he said:  In the morning the Lord will make known who belong to him, and the holy he will join to himself:  and whom he shall choose, they shall approach to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-626">16:6</span>. Do this therefore:  Take every man of you your censers, thou Core, and all thy company.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-627">16:7</span>. And putting fire in them to morrow, put incense upon it before the Lord:  and whomsoever he shall choose, the same shall be holy:  you take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-628">16:8</span>. And he said again to Core:  Hear ye sons of Levi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-629">16:9</span>. Is it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath spared you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and should stand before the congregation of the people, and should minister to him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-630">16:10</span>. Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him, that you should challenge to yourselves the priesthood also,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-631">16:11</span>. And that all thy company should stand against the Lord?  for what is Aaron that you murmur against him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-632">16:12</span>. Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab.  But they answered:  We will not come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-633">16:13</span>. Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-634">16:14</span>. Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes?  We will not come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-635">16:15</span>. Moses therefore being very angry, said to the Lord:  Respect not their sacrifices:  thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them.<br/>
<br/>
Very angry. . .This anger was a zeal against sin; and an indignation at the affront offered to God; like that which the same holy prophet conceived upon the sight of the golden calf, Ex. 32.19.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-636">16:16</span>. And he said to Core:  Do thou and thy congregation stand apart before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-637">16:17</span>. Take every one of you censers, and put incense upon them, offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers:  let Aaron also hold his censer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-638">16:18</span>. When they had done this, Moses and Aaron standing,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-640">16:20</span>. And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron, said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-641">16:21</span>. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may presently destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-642">16:22</span>. They fell flat on their face, and said:  O most mighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one man's sin shall thy wrath rage against all?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">16:23</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-644">16:24</span>. Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-645">16:25</span>. And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron:  and the ancients of Israel following him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-646">16:26</span>. He said to the multitude:  Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-647">16:27</span>. And when they were departed from their tents round about, Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-648">16:28</span>. And Moses said:  By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own head:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-649">16:29</span>. If these men die the common death of men, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the Lord did not send me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-650">16:30</span>. But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down alive into hell, you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-651">16:31</span>. And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-652">16:32</span>. And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their substance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-653">16:33</span>. And they went down alive into hell, the ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-654">16:34</span>. But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of them that were perishing:  saying:  Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-655">16:35</span>. And a fire coming out from the Lord, destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-656">16:36</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">16:37</span>. Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire of one side and the other:  because they are sanctified<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">16:38</span>. In the deaths of the sinners:  and let him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">16:39</span>. Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates, fastening them to the altar:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-660">16:40</span>. That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any one that is not of the seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-661">16:41</span>. The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying:  You have killed the people of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">16:42</span>. And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">16:43</span>. Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant.  And when they were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">16:44</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-665">16:45</span>. Get you out from the midst of this multitude, this moment will I destroy them.  And as they were lying on the ground,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">16:46</span>. Moses said to Aaron:  Take the censer, and putting fire in it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the people to pray for them:  for already wrath is gone out from the Lord, and the plague rageth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-667">16:47</span>. When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the incense:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-668">16:48</span>. And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the people, and the plague ceased.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-669">16:49</span>. And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-670">16:50</span>. And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant after the destruction was over.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">17:1</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>

<br/>
The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded, etc. . .This rod of Aaron which thus miraculously brought forth fruit, was a figure of the blessed Virgin conceiving and bringing forth her Son without any prejudice to her virginity.<br/>

A red cow, etc. . .This red cow, offered in sacrifice for sin, and consumed with fire without the camp, with the ashes of which, mingled with water, the unclean were to be expiated and purified; was a figure of the passion of Christ, by whose precious blood applied to our souls in the holy sacraments, we are cleansed from our sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">19:3</span>. And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest, who shall bring her forth without the camp, and shall immolate her in the sight of all:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">19:5</span>. And shall burn her in the sight of all delivering up to the fire her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and her dung.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">19:19</span>. And in this manner he that is clean shall purify the unclean on the third and on the seventh day.  And being expiated the seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments, and be unclean until the evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">19:20</span>. If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul shall perish out of the midst of the church:  because he hath profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the water of purification.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">19:21</span>. This precept shall be an ordinance for ever.  He also that sprinkled the water, shall wash his garments.  Every one that shall touch the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">19:22</span>. Whatsoever a person toucheth who is unclean, he shall make it unclean:  and the person that toucheth any of these things, shall be unclean until the evening.<br/>

<br/>
The death of Mary the sister of Moses.  The people murmur for want of water:  God giveth it them from the rock.  The death of Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">20:1</span>. And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came into the desert of Sin, in the first month:  and the people abode in Cades.  And Mary died there, and was buried in the same place.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">20:2</span>. And the people wanting water, came together against Moses and Aaron:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">20:3</span>. And making a sedition, they said:  Would God we had perished among our brethren before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-749">20:4</span>. Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-750">20:5</span>. Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-751">20:6</span>. And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon the ground, and cried to the Lord, and said.  O Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur.  And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-752">20:7</span>. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-753">20:8</span>. Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield waters.  And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">20:9</span>. Moses therefore took the rod, which was before the Lord, as he had commanded him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">20:10</span>. And having gathered together the multitude before the rock, he said to them:  Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous:  Can we bring you forth water out of this rock?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">20:11</span>. And when Moses bad lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the people and their cattle drank,<br/>
<br/>
The rock. . .This rock was a figure of Christ, and the water that issued out from the rock, of his precious blood, the source of all our good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">20:12</span>. And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:  Because you have not believed me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you shall not bring these people into the land, which I will give them.<br/>
<br/>
You have not believed, etc. . .The fault of Moses and Aaron, on this occasion, was a certain diffidence and weakness of faith; not doubting of God's power or veracity; but apprehending the unworthiness of that rebellious and incredulous people, and therefore speaking with some ambiguity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">20:13</span>. This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of Israel strove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.<br/>
<br/>
The Water of contradiction. . .Or strife.  Hebrew, Meribah.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">20:14</span>. In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, to say:  Thus saith thy brother Israel:  Thou knowest all the labour that hath come upon us:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">20:15</span>. In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt, and there we dwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">20:16</span>. And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent an angel, who hath brought us out of Egypt.  Lo, we are now in the city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy borders,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">20:17</span>. And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country.  We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, we will not drink the waters of thy wells, but we will go by the common highway, neither turning aside to the right hand, nor to the left, till we are past thy borders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-763">20:18</span>. And Edom answered them:  Thou shalt not pass by me:  if thou dost I will come out armed against thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-764">20:19</span>. And the children of Israel said:  We will go by the beaten way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is just:  there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass speedily.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-765">20:20</span>. But he answered:  Thou shalt not pass.  And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-766">20:21</span>. Neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them passage through his borders.  Wherefore Israel turned another way from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-767">20:22</span>. And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to mount Hor, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-768">20:23</span>. Where the Lord spoke to Moses:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-769">20:24</span>. Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people:  for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-770">20:25</span>. Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount Hor:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-771">20:26</span>. And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son:  Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and die there.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-772">20:27</span>. Moses did as the Lord had commanded:  and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-773">20:28</span>. And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he vested Eleazar his son with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-774">20:29</span>. And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain, he came down with Eleazar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-775">20:30</span>. And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for him thirty days throughout all their families.<br/>

<br/>
King Arad is overcome.  The people murmur and are punished with fiery serpents:  they are healed by the brazen serpent.  They conquer the kings Sehon and Og.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-778">21:1</span>. And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-779">21:2</span>. But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said:  If thou wilt deliver thus people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-780">21:3</span>. And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities:  and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.<br/>
<br/>
Anathema. . .That is, a thing devoted to utter destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-781">21:4</span>. And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom.  And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-782">21:5</span>. And speaking against God and Moses, they said:  Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness?  There is no bread, nor have we any waters:  our soul now loatheth this very light food.<br/>
<br/>
Very light food. . .So they call the heavenly manna:  thus worldlings loathe the things of heaven, for which they have no relish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-783">21:6</span>. Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.<br/>
<br/>
Fiery serpents. . .They are so called, because they that were bitten by them were burnt with a violent heat.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-784">21:7</span>. Upon which they came to Moses, and said; We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee:  pray that he may take away these serpents from us.  And Moses prayed for the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-785">21:8</span>. And the Lord said to him:  Make a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign:  whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-786">21:9</span>. Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed.<br/>
<br/>
A brazen serpent. . .This was a figure of Christ crucified, and of the efficacy of a lively faith in him, against the bites of the hellish serpent.  John 3.14.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-787">21:10</span>. And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in Oboth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-788">21:11</span>. And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-789">21:12</span>. And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-790">21:13</span>. Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite.  For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-791">21:14</span>. Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord:  As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Arnon.<br/>
<br/>
The book of the wars, etc. . .An ancient book, which, like several others quoted in scripture, has been lost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-792">21:15</span>. The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the Moabites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-793">21:16</span>. When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses:  Gather the people together, and I will give them water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-794">21:17</span>. Then Israel sung this song:  Let the well spring up.  They sung thereto:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-795">21:18</span>. The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their staves.  And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-796">21:19</span>. From Mathana unto Nahaliel:  from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-797">21:20</span>. From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the top of Phasga, which looked towards the desert.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-798">21:21</span>. And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-799">21:22</span>. I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king's highway, till we be past thy borders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-800">21:23</span>. And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa and fought against them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-801">21:24</span>. And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon:  for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-802">21:25</span>. So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-803">21:26</span>. Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, who fought against the king of Moab:  and took all the land, that had been of his dominion, as far as the Arnon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-804">21:27</span>. Therefore it is said in the proverb:  Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-805">21:28</span>. A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">21:29</span>. Woe to thee Moab:  thou art undone, O people of Chamos.  He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-807">21:30</span>. Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-808">21:31</span>. So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-809">21:32</span>. And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer:  and they took the villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-810">21:33</span>. And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in Edrai.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-811">21:34</span>. And the Lord said to Moses:  Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand:  and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">22:5</span>. He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say:  Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">22:6</span>. Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I:  if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-821">22:7</span>. And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands.  And where they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-822">22:8</span>. He answered:  Tarry here this night and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me.  And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-832">22:18</span>. Balaam answered:  If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-833">22:19</span>. I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.<br/>
<br/>
To stay. . .His desiring them to stay, after he had been fully informed already that it was not God's will he should go, came from the inclination he had to gratify Balac, for the sake of worldly gain.  And this perverse disposition God punished by permitting him to go (though not to curse the people as he would willingly have done), and suffering him to fall still deeper and deeper into sin, till he came at last to give that abominable counsel against the people of God, which ended in his own destruction.  So sad a thing it is to indulge a passion for money.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-834">22:20</span>. God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him:  If these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them:  yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-835">22:21</span>. Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-836">22:22</span>. And God was angry.  And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-837">22:23</span>. The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field.  And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">22:24</span>. The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-839">22:25</span>. And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider.  But he beat her again:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-840">22:26</span>. And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-841">22:27</span>. And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider:  who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-842">22:28</span>. And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said:  What have I done to thee?  Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?<br/>
<br/>
Opened the mouth, etc. . .The angel moved the tongue of the ass, to utter these speeches, to rebuke, by the mouth of a brute beast, the brutal fury and folly of Balaam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">22:29</span>. Balaam answered:  Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill:  I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-844">22:30</span>. The ass said:  Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day?  tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee.  But he said:  Never.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-845">22:31</span>. Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">22:32</span>. And the angel said to him:  Why beatest thou thy ass these three times?  I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me:<br/>
<br/>
Perverse. . .Because thy inclinations are wicked in being willing for the sake of gain to curse the people of whom I am the guardian.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">22:33</span>. And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">22:34</span>. Balaam said:  I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me:  and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">22:35</span>. The angel said:  Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee.  He went therefore with the princes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">22:36</span>. And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">22:37</span>. And he said to Balaam:  I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me?  was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">22:38</span>. He answered him:  Lo, here I am:  shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">22:39</span>. So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">22:40</span>. And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">22:41</span>. And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">23:4</span>. And when he was gone with speed, God met him.  And Balaam speaking to him, said:  I have erected seven altars, and have laid on everyone a calf and a ram.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">23:7</span>. And taking up his parable, he said:  Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east:  Come, said he, and curse Jacob:  make haste and detest Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">23:8</span>. How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed?  By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">23:12</span>. He answered him:  Can I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-892">24:3</span>. He took up his parable and said:  Balaam the son of Beor hath said:  The man hath said, whose eye is stopped up:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-900">24:11</span>. Return to thy place.  I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.<br/>

Our father died in the desert, and was not in the sedition, that was raised against the Lord under Core, but he died in his own sin:  and he had no male children.

<br/>
That the inheritances may not be alienated from one tribe to another, all are to marry within their own tribes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1347">36:1</span>. And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, of the stock of the children of Joseph, came and spoke to Moses before the princes of Israel, and said:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1348">36:2</span>. The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their father:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1349">36:3</span>. Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession will follow them, and being transferred to another tribe, will be a diminishing of our inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1350">36:4</span>. And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, the is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1351">36:5</span>. Moses answered the children of Israel, and said by the command of the Lord:  The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1352">36:6</span>. And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad:  Let them marry to whom they will, only so that it be to men of their own tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1353">36:7</span>. Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe.  For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1354">36:8</span>. And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe:  that the inheritance may remain in the families.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1355">36:9</span>. And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1356">36:10</span>. As they were separated by the Lord.  And the daughters of Salphaad did as was commanded:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1357">36:11</span>. And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1358">36:12</span>. Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph:  and the possession that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and family of their father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1359">36:13</span>. These are the commandments and judgment, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho.<br/>
