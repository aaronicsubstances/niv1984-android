<p>THE BOOK OF PROVERBS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is so called, because it consists of wise and weighty sentences:  regulating the morals of men:  and directing them to wisdom and virtue.  And these sentences are also called PARABLES, because great truths are often couched in them under certain figures and
similitudes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Proverbs Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The use and end of the proverbs.  An exhortation to flee the company of the wicked:  and to hearken to the voice of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. To know wisdom, and instruction:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. To understand the words of prudence:  and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser:  and he that understandeth shall possess governments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  Fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. If they shall say:  Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. Turn ye at my reproof:  behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Because I called, and you refused:  I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand:  when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear:  they shall rise in the morning, and shall not find me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. Because they have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">1:32</span>. The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">1:33</span>. But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.<br/>

<p><b>Proverbs Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-36"/>
</b><br/>
The advantages of wisdom:  and the evils from which it delivers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:1</span>. My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:2</span>. That thy ear may hearken to wisdom:  incline thy heart to know prudence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:3</span>. For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:4</span>. If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:5</span>. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:6</span>. Because the Lord giveth wisdom:  and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:7</span>. He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:8</span>. Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:9</span>. Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:10</span>. If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:11</span>. Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:12</span>. That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:13</span>. Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:14</span>. Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most wicked things:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:15</span>. Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:16</span>. That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the stranger, who softeneth her words;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">2:17</span>. And forsaketh the guide of her youth,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:18</span>. And hath forgotten the covenant of her God:  for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">2:19</span>. None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">2:20</span>. That thou mayst walk in a good way:  and mayst keep the paths of the just.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">2:21</span>. For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the simple shall continue in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">2:22</span>. But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth:  and they that do unjustly, shall be taken away from it.<br/>

<p><b>Proverbs Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-60"/>
</b><br/>
An exhortation to the practice of virtue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:1</span>. My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:2</span>. For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life, and peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:3</span>. Let not mercy aud truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:4</span>. And thou shalt find grace, and good understanding before God and men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:5</span>. Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:6</span>. In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:7</span>. Be not wise in thy own conceit:  fear God, and depart from evil:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:8</span>. For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:9</span>. Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:10</span>. And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:11</span>. My son, reject not the correction of the Lord:  and do not faint when thou art chastised by him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:12</span>. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth:  and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:13</span>. Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:14</span>. The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chief and purest gold:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:15</span>. She is more precious than all riches:  and all the things that are desired, are not to be compared to her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:16</span>. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:17</span>. Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:18</span>. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her:  and he that shall retain her is blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:19</span>. The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the heavens by prudence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">3:20</span>. By his wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:21</span>. My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes:  keep the law and counsel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">3:22</span>. And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">3:23</span>. Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">3:24</span>. If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear:  thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">3:25</span>. Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked falling upon thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">3:26</span>. For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">3:27</span>. Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able:  if thou art able, do good thyself also.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">3:28</span>. Say not to thy friend:  Go, and come again:  and to morrow I will give to thee:  when thou canst give at present.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">3:29</span>. Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">3:30</span>. Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">3:31</span>. Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">3:32</span>. For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is with the simple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">3:33</span>. Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked:  but the habitations of the just shall be blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">3:34</span>. He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">3:35</span>. The wise shall possess glory:  the promotion of fools is disgrace.</p>

</b><br/>
A further exhortation to seek after wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">4:1</span>. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend, that you may know prudence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">4:2</span>. I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">4:3</span>. For I also was my father's son, tender, and as an only son in the sight of my mother:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">4:4</span>. And he taught me, and said:  Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:5</span>. Get wisdom, get prudence:  forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:6</span>. Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee:  love her, and she shall preserve thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-104">4:7</span>. The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-105">4:8</span>. Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee:  thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">4:9</span>. She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">4:10</span>. Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">4:11</span>. I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">4:12</span>. Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">4:13</span>. Take hold on instruction, leave it not:  keep it, because it is thy life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">4:14</span>. Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">4:15</span>. Flee from it, pass not by it:  go aside, and forsake it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">4:16</span>. For they sleep not, except they have done evil:  and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">4:17</span>. They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">4:18</span>. But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards, and increaseth even to perfect day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">4:19</span>. The way of the wicked is darksome:  they know not where they fall.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">4:20</span>. My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">4:21</span>. Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">4:22</span>. For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">4:23</span>. With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">4:24</span>. Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">4:25</span>. Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">4:26</span>. Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">4:27</span>. Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left:  turn away thy foot from evil.  For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand:  but those are perverse which are on the left hand.  But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:2</span>. That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction.  Mind not the deceit of a woman.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">5:13</span>. And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not inclined my ear to masters?<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:2</span>. Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:3</span>. Do, therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself:  because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour.  Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:6</span>. Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">6:7</span>. Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">6:10</span>. Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">6:11</span>. And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed.  But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">6:12</span>. A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">6:22</span>. When thou walkest, let them go with thee:  when thou sleepest, let them keep thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">6:23</span>. Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">6:24</span>. That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">6:26</span>. For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf:  but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">6:28</span>. Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">6:29</span>. So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">6:30</span>. The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen:  for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:<br/>
<br/>
The fault is not so great, etc. . .The sin of theft is not so great, as to be compared with adultery:  especially when a person pressed with hunger (which is the case here spoken of) steals to satisfy nature. Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired, than the wrong done by adultery.  But this does not hinder, but that theft also is a mortal sin, forbidden by one of the ten commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">6:31</span>. And if he be taken, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">6:32</span>. But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">6:33</span>. He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">6:34</span>. Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">6:35</span>. Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.<br/>

Gatherer, etc. . .Or, as it is in the Latin, Congregans the son of Vomens.  The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves, which are in the Hebrew, Agur the son of Jakeh.  But whether this Agur be the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or proverbs, is uncertain.<br/>
