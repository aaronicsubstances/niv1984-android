<p>THE BOOK OF PSALMS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
The psalms are called by the Hebrews TEHILLIM, that is, Hymns of Praise.  The author, of a great part of them at least, was king David: but many are of opinion that some of them were made by Asaph, and others whose names are prefixed in the titles.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Psalms Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Beatus vir.<br/>
<br/>
The happiness of the just and the evil state of the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season.  And his leaf shall not fall off:  and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Not so the wicked, not so:  but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment:  nor sinners in the council of the just.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. For the Lord knoweth the way of the just:  and the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p><b>Psalms Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-9"/>
</b><br/>
Quare fremuerunt.<br/>
<br/>
The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">2:1</span>. Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">2:2</span>. The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">2:3</span>. Let us break their bonds asunder:  and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">2:4</span>. He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them:  and the Lord shall deride them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">2:5</span>. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">2:6</span>. But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain, preaching his commandment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">2:7</span>. The Lord hath said to me:  Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">2:8</span>. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">2:9</span>. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">2:10</span>. And now, O ye kings, understand:  receive instruction, you that judge the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:11</span>. Serve ye the Lord with fear:  and rejoice unto him with trembling.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:12</span>. Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:13</span>. When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all they that trust in him.<br/>

<p><b>Psalms Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-24"/>
</b><br/>
Domine, quid multiplicati.<br/>
<br/>
The prophet's danger and delivery from his son Absalom:  mystically, the passion and resurrection of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">3:1</span>. The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">3:2</span>. Many say to my soul:  There is no salvation for him in his God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">3:4</span>. But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">3:5</span>. I have cried to the Lord with my voice:  and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">3:6</span>. I have slept and have taken my rest:  and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">3:7</span>. I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me:  arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">3:8</span>. For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause:  thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">3:9</span>. Salvation is of the Lord:  and thy blessing is upon thy people.</p>

<p><b>Psalms Chapter 4<br id="bookmark-drb1752-34"/>

Cum invocarem.<br/>
<br/>
The prophet teacheth us to flee to God in tribulation, with confidence in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">4:1</span>. Unto the end, in verses.  A psalm for David.<br/>
<br/>
Unto the end. . .Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh:  which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung:  we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.--Ibid.  In verses, in carminibus. . .In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.--Ibid.  For David, or to David. . .That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">4:2</span>. When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me:  when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me.  Have mercy on me:  and hear my prayer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">4:3</span>. O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart?  why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">4:4</span>. Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful:  the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">4:5</span>. Be ye angry, and sin not:  the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">4:6</span>. Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord:  many say, Who sheweth us good things?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">4:7</span>. The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us:  thou hast given gladness in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">4:8</span>. By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">4:9</span>. In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">4:10</span>. For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.</p>

Verba mea auribul.<br/>
<br/>
A prayer to God against the iniquities of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">5:1</span>. Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance.  A psalm for David.<br/>
<br/>
For her that obtaineth the inheritance. . .That is, for the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">5:2</span>. Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">5:3</span>. Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">5:4</span>. For to thee will I pray:  O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">5:5</span>. In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see:  because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">5:6</span>. Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee:  nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">5:7</span>. Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity:  thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.  The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">5:8</span>. But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">5:9</span>. Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice:  because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">5:10</span>. For there is no truth in their mouth:  their heart is vain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">5:11</span>. Their throat is an open sepulchre:  they dealt deceitfully with their tongues:  judge them, O God.  Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out:  for they have provoked thee, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">5:12</span>. But let all them be glad that hope in thee:  they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them.  And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">5:13</span>. For thou wilt bless the just.  O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as with a shield of thy good will.<br/>

<p><b>Psalms Chapter 6<br id="bookmark-drb1752-61"/>
</b><br/>
Domine, ne in furore.<br/>
<br/>
A prayer of a penitent sinner, under the scourge of God.  The first penitential psalm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">6:1</span>. Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave.<br/>
<br/>
For the octave. . .That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings.  St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life:  and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">6:2</span>. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">6:3</span>. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak:  heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">6:4</span>. And my soul is troubled exceedingly:  but thou, O Lord, how long?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">6:5</span>. Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul:  O save me for thy mercy's sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">6:6</span>. For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee:  and who shall confess to thee in hell?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">6:7</span>. I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed:  I will water my couch with my tears.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">6:8</span>. My eye is troubled through indignation:  I have grown old amongst all my enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">6:9</span>. Depart from em, all ye workers of iniquity:  for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">6:10</span>. The Lord hath heard my supplication:  the Lord hath received my prayer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">6:11</span>. Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled:  let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">7:4</span>. O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">7:5</span>. If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">7:6</span>. Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">7:7</span>. Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger:  and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies.  And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">7:8</span>. And a congregation of people shall surround thee.  And for their sakes return thou on high.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">7:9</span>. The Lord judgeth the people.  Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">7:10</span>. The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just:  the searcher of hearts and reins is God.  Just<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">7:11</span>. Is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">7:12</span>. God is a just judge, strong and patient:  is he angry every day?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">7:13</span>. Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">7:14</span>. And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.<br/>
<br/>
For them that burn. . .That is, against the persecutors of his saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">7:15</span>. Behold he hath been in labour with injustice:  he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">7:16</span>. He hath opened a pit and dug it:  and he is fallen into the hole he made.<br/>

<br/>
The presses. . .In Hebrew, Gittith, supposed to be a musical instrument.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">8:2</span>. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth! For thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens.<br/>

The hidden things of the Son. . .The humility and sufferings of Christ, the Son of God; and of good Christians, who are his sons by adoption; are called hidden things, with regard to the children of this world, who know not the value and merit of them.<br/>

Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10.  And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Psalm 10 according to the Hebrews.<br/>
<br/>
9a:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off?  why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble?<br/>
<br/>
9a:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire:  they are caught in the counsels which they devise.<br/>
<br/>
9a:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul:  and the unjust man is blessed.<br/>
<br/>
9a:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him:<br/>
<br/>
9a:5. God is not before his eyes:  his ways are filthy at all times.  Thy judgments are removed form his sight:  he shall rule over all his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
9a:6. For he hath said in his heart:  I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.<br/>
<br/>
9a:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow.<br/>

9a:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may kill the innocent.<br/>
<br/>
9a:9. His eyes are upon the poor man:  he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den.  He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.<br/>
<br/>
9a:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.<br/>
<br/>
9a:11. For he hath said in his heart:  God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end.<br/>
<br/>
9a:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted:  forget not the poor.<br/>
<br/>
9a:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God?  for he hath said in his heart:  He will not require it.<br/>
<br/>
9a:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow:  that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands.  To thee is the poor man left:  thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.<br/>
<br/>
9a:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant:  his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.<br/>
<br/>
9a:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever:  ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.<br/>
<br/>
9a:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor:  thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.<br/>
<br/>
9a:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.<br/>

Shall reduce them to pieces, etc. . .In Hebrew, shall make them to skip like a calf.  The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder (which he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip, etc.  All this is to be understood mystically of the powerful voice of God's word in his church; which has broken the pride of the great ones of this world, and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to the sweet yoke of Christ.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">48:6</span>. Why shall I fear in the evil day?  the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.<br/>
<br/>
The iniquity of my heel. . .That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours:  or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the iniquity in which I shall be found in death.  The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">48:7</span>. They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,<br/>
<br/>
They that trust, etc. . .As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches:  for they have great reason to fear:  seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-821">48:8</span>. No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem:  he shall not give to God his ransom,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-822">48:9</span>. Nor the price of the redemption of his soul:  and shall labour for ever,<br/>
<br/>
And shall labour for ever, etc. . .This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence:  as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world.  Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-823">48:10</span>. And shall still live unto the end.<br/>

<br/>
He shall not see destruction, etc. . .Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-825">48:12</span>. And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever.  Their dwelling places to all generations:  they have called their lands by their names.<br/>

They have called, etc. . .That is, they have left their names on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-826">48:13</span>. And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-827">48:14</span>. This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them:  and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.<br/>
<br/>
They shall delight in their mouth. . .Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and glory in their doings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-828">48:15</span>. They are laid in hell like sheep:  death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning. . .That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the just shall judge and condemn the wicked.  Ibid.  From their glory. . .That is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-829">48:16</span>. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-830">48:17</span>. Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rick, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.<br/>
<br/>

It is verified in the servants of God, living together in his house, which is the church.  1 Tim. 3.15.--Ibid.

Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds. . .or the wild beasts, which lie hid in the reeds.  That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to surprise their prey.  Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors, who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds, which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of the Almighty.  The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine, that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried by fire.<br/>

The temptation of the weak, upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked, is overcome by the consideration of the justice of God, who will quickly render to every one according to his works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1257">72:1</span>. A psalm for Asaph.  How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1258">72:2</span>. But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1259">72:3</span>. Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1260">72:4</span>. For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1261">72:5</span>. They are not in the labour of men:  neither shall they be scourged like other men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1262">72:6</span>. Therefore pride hath held them fast:  they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1263">72:7</span>. Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness:  they have passed into the affection of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
Fatness. . .Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them in their iniquity:  and made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1264">72:8</span>. They have thought and spoken wickedness:  they have spoken iniquity on high.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1265">72:9</span>. They have set their mouth against heaven:  and their tongue hath passed through the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1266">72:10</span>. Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them.<br/>
<br/>
Return here. . .or hither.  The weak among the servants of God, will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence which are set down in the following verses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1267">72:11</span>. And they said:  How doth God know?  and is there knowledge in the most High?<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1269">72:13</span>. And I said:  Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1274">72:18</span>. But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them:  when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast put it to them. . .In punishment of their deceits, or for deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end, which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1275">72:19</span>. How are they brought to desolation?  they have suddenly ceased to be:  they have perished by reason of their iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1276">72:20</span>. As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1277">72:21</span>. For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1278">72:22</span>. And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1279">72:23</span>. I am become as a beast before thee:  and I am always with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1280">72:24</span>. Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1281">72:25</span>. For what have I in heaven?  and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1282">72:26</span>. For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away:  thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1283">72:27</span>. For behold they that go far from thee shall perish:  thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1284">72:28</span>. But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God:  That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.<br/>

A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1288">73:2</span>. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning.  The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1289">73:3</span>. Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1290">73:4</span>. And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity.  They have set up their ensigns for signs,<br/>
<br/>
Their ensigns, etc. . .They have fixed their colours for signs and trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple:  and they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place. This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the profanation of the temple by Antiochus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1291">73:5</span>. And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1292">73:6</span>. They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1299">73:13</span>. Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm:  thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.<br/>
<br/>
The sea firm. . .By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm walls, whilst Israel passed through:  and destroying the Egyptians called here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king:  casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1300">73:14</span>. Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon:  thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1301">73:15</span>. Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents:  thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers.<br/>
<br/>
Ethan rivers. . .That is, rivers which run with strong streams.  This was verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21.14.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1302">73:16</span>. Thine is the day, and thine is the night:  thou hast made the morning light and the sun.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1303">73:17</span>. Thou hast made all the borders of the earth:  the summer and the spring were formed by thee.<br/>

The obscure of the earth. . .Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled, that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.<br/>

<br/>
Corrupt not. . .It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung.  St. Augustine and other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to faint or fail in our hope:  but to persevere with constancy in good: because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man according to his works.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1378">77:16</span>. He brought forth water out of the rock:  and made streams run down as rivers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1379">77:17</span>. And they added yet more sin against him:  they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1381">77:19</span>. And they spoke ill of God:  they said:  Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1382">77:20</span>. Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed.  Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1383">77:21</span>. Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry:  and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1384">77:22</span>. Because they believed not in God:  and trusted not in his salvation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1385">77:23</span>. And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1388">77:26</span>. He removed the south wind from heaven:  and by his power brought in the southwest wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1389">77:27</span>. And he rained upon them flesh as dust:  and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1390">77:28</span>. And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1391">77:29</span>. So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1392">77:30</span>. they were not defrauded of that which they craved.  As yet their meat was in their mouth:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1394">77:32</span>. In all these things they sinned still:  and they behaved not for his wondrous works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1395">77:33</span>. And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1396">77:34</span>. When he slew them, then they sought him:  and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1397">77:35</span>. And they remembered that God was their helper:  and the most high God their redeemer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1398">77:36</span>. And they loved him with their mouth:  and with their tongue they lied unto him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1399">77:37</span>. But their heart was not right with him:  nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1400">77:38</span>. But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins:  and will not destroy them.  And many a time did he turn away his anger:  and did not kindle all his wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1401">77:39</span>. And he remembered that they are flesh:  a wind that goeth and returneth not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1402">77:40</span>. How often did they provoke him in the desert:  and move him to wrath in the place without water?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1403">77:41</span>. And they turned back and tempted God:  and grieved the holy one of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1404">77:42</span>. They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1405">77:43</span>. How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1406">77:44</span>. And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1407">77:45</span>. He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1408">77:46</span>. And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1409">77:47</span>. And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1410">77:48</span>. And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1411">77:49</span>. And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation:  indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1412">77:50</span>. He made a way for a path to his anger:  he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1413">77:51</span>. And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt:  the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1414">77:52</span>. And he took away his own people as sheep:  and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1415">77:53</span>. And he brought them out in hope and they feared not:  and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1416">77:54</span>. And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary:  the mountain which his right hand had purchased.  And he cast out the Gentiles before them:  and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1417">77:55</span>. And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1418">77:56</span>. Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God:  and they kept not his testimonies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1419">77:57</span>. And they turned away, and kept not the covenant:  even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1420">77:58</span>. They provoked him to anger on their hills:  and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1421">77:59</span>. God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1422">77:60</span>. And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1423">77:61</span>. And he delivered their strength into captivity:  and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1424">77:62</span>. And he shut up his people under the sword:  and he despised his inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1425">77:63</span>. Fire consumed their young men:  and their maidens were not lamented.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1426">77:64</span>. Their priests fell by the sword:  and their widows did not mourn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1427">77:65</span>. And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1428">77:66</span>. And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts:  he put them to an everlasting reproach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1429">77:67</span>. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph:  and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1430">77:68</span>. But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1431">77:69</span>. And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever.<br/>
<br/>
As of unicorns. . .That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn.  This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm, foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting sanctuary of God, in his church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1432">77:70</span>. And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep:  he brought him from following the ewes great with young,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1433">77:71</span>. To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.<br/>
<br/>

Adore his footstool. . .The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old Testament, God's footstool:  over which he was understood to sit, on his propitiatory, or mercy seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the cherubims, in the sanctuary:  to which the children of Israel paid a great veneration.  But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries:  inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the footstool of the divinity.  So St. Ambrose, L. 3.  De Spiritu Sancto, c. 12.  And St. Augustine upon this psalm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1804">98:6</span>. Moses and Aaron among his priests:  and Samuel among them that call upon his name.  They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:<br/>
<br/>
Moses and Aaron among his priests. . .By this it is evident, that Moses also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, inasmuch as he consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him.  Lev. 8.  So that his pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1805">98:7</span>. He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud.  They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.<br/>

Benedic, anima.<br/>
<br/>
God is to be praised for his mighty works, and wonderful providence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1882">103:1</span>. For David himself.  Bless the Lord, O my soul:  O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great.  Thou hast put on praise and beauty:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1883">103:2</span>. And art clothed with light as with a garment.  Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1884">103:3</span>. Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water.  Who makest the clouds thy chariot:  who walkest upon the wings of the winds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1885">103:4</span>. Who makest thy angels spirits:  and thy ministers a burning fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1886">103:5</span>. Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases:  it shall not be moved for ever and ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1887">103:6</span>. The deep like a garment is its clothing:  above the mountains shall the waters stand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1888">103:7</span>. At thy rebuke they shall flee:  at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1889">103:8</span>. The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1890">103:9</span>. Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1891">103:10</span>. Thou sendest forth springs in the vales:  between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1892">103:11</span>. All the beasts of the field shall drink:  the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1893">103:12</span>. Over them the birds of the air shall dwell:  from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1894">103:13</span>. Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms:  the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1897">103:16</span>. The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1901">103:20</span>. Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night:  in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1902">103:21</span>. The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1927">104:9</span>. Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1928">104:10</span>. And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1929">104:11</span>. Saying:  To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1930">104:12</span>. When they were but a small number:  yea very few, and sojourners therein:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1931">104:13</span>. And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1932">104:14</span>. He suffered no man to hurt them:  and he reproved kings for their sakes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1933">104:15</span>. Touch ye not my anointed:  and do no evil to my prophets.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1935">104:17</span>. He sent a man before them:  Joseph, who was sold for a slave.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1936">104:18</span>. They humbled his feet in fetters:  the iron pierced his soul,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1937">104:19</span>. Until his word came.  The word of the Lord inflamed him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1938">104:20</span>. The king sent, and he released him:  the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1939">104:21</span>. He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1940">104:22</span>. That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1941">104:23</span>. And Israel went into Egypt:  and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1942">104:24</span>. And he increased his people exceedingly:  and strengthened them over their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1943">104:25</span>. He turned their heart to hate his people:  and to deal deceitfully with his servants.<br/>
<br/>
He turned their heart, etc. . .Not that God (who is never the author of sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of the benefits which God bestowed upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1944">104:26</span>. He sent Moses his servant:  Aaron the man whom he had chosen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1945">104:27</span>. He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1946">104:28</span>. He sent darkness, and made it obscure:  and grieved not his words.<br/>
<br/>
Grieved not his words. . .That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his words:  or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words: or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1947">104:29</span>. He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1948">104:30</span>. Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1949">104:31</span>. He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts.<br/>
<br/>
Sciniphs. . .See the annotation, Ex.8.16.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1950">104:32</span>. He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1951">104:33</span>. And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees:  and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1952">104:34</span>. He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number.<br/>
<br/>
Bruchus. . .An insect of the locust kind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1953">104:35</span>. And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1955">104:37</span>. And he brought them out with silver and gold:  and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1956">104:38</span>. Egypt was glad when they departed:  for the fear of them lay upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1957">104:39</span>. He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1958">104:40</span>. They asked, and the quail came:  and he filled them with the bread of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1959">104:41</span>. He opened the rock, and waters flowed:  rivers ran down in the dry land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1960">104:42</span>. Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1961">104:43</span>. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1963">104:45</span>. That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law.<br/>
<br/>
His justifications. . .That is, his commandments; which here, and in many other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the keeping of them makes man just.  The Protestants render it by the word statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works to justify.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1987">105:22</span>. Wondrous works in the land of Cham:  terrible things in the Red Sea.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1988">105:23</span>. And he said that he would destroy them:  had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach:  To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1993">105:28</span>. They also were initiated to Beelphegor:  and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Initiated. . .That is, they dedicated, or consecrated themselves to the idol of the Moabites and Madianites, called Beelphegor, or Baal-Peor. Num. 25.3.--Ibid.  The dead. . .Viz., idols without life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1994">105:29</span>. And they provoked him with their inventions:  and destruction was multiplied among them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1997">105:32</span>. They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction:  and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1998">105:33</span>. Because they exasperated his spirit.  And he distinguished with his lips.<br/>
<br/>
He distinguished with his lips. . .Moses, by occasion of the people's rebellion and incredulity, was guilty of distinguishing with his lips; when, instead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded, he said to the people, with a certain hesitation in his faith, Hear ye, rebellious and incredulous:  Can we from this rock bring out water for you?  Num. 20.10.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1999">105:34</span>. They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2000">105:35</span>. And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2001">105:36</span>. And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2002">105:37</span>. And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2003">105:38</span>. And they shed innocent blood:  the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan.  And the land was polluted with blood,<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2079">108:3</span>. They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2081">108:5</span>. And they repaid me evil for good:  and hatred for my love.<br/>
<br/>

Set thou the sinner over him, etc. . .Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him:  let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as curses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2083">108:7</span>. When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2155">113:2</span>. Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.<br/>

<br/>
ALEPH.<br/>
<br/>
Aleph. . .The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The second eight verses begin with Beth, the name of the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet; and so to the end of the whole alphabet, in all twenty-two letters, each letter having eight verses. This order is variously expounded by the holy fathers; which shews the difficulty of understanding the holy scriptures, and consequently with what humility, and submission to the Church they are to be read.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2240">118:1</span>. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.<br/>

<br/>
His testimonies. . .The commandments of God are called his testimonies, because they testify his holy will unto us.  Note here, that in almost every verse of this psalm (which in number are 176) the word and law of God, and the love and observance of it, is perpetually inculcated, under a variety of denominations, all signifying the same thing.<br/>

A gradual canticle.<br/>
<br/>
A gradual canticle. . .The following psalms, in number fifteen, are called gradual psalms, or canticles, from the word gradus, signifying steps, ascensions, or degrees:  either because they were appointed to be sung on the fifteen steps, by which the people ascended to the temple: or, that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain steps or ascensions:  or, that they were to be sung by the people returning from their captivity and ascending to Jerusalem, which was seated amongst mountains.  The holy fathers, in a mystical sense, understand these steps, or ascensions, of the degrees by which Christians spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection; and to the true temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem.<br/>

A prayer against sinful words, and deceitful flatterers.<br/>
<br/>
A psalm of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2665">140:1</span>. I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me:  hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2666">140:2</span>. Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2669">140:5</span>. The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head.  For my prayer shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased:<br/>
<br/>
Let not the oil of the sinner, etc. . .That is, the flattery, or deceitful praise.--Ibid.  For my prayer, etc. . .So far from coveting their praises, who are never well pleased but with things that are evil; I shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they are delighted with.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2670">140:6</span>. Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up.  They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:<br/>
<br/>
Their judges, etc. . .Their rulers, or chiefs, quickly vanish and perish, like ships dashed against the rocks, and swallowed up by the waves.  Let them then hear my words, for they are powerful and will prevail; or, as it is in the Hebrew, for they are sweet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2671">140:7</span>. As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2672">140:8</span>. But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes:  in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2673">140:9</span>. Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2674">140:10</span>. The wicked shall fall in his net:  I am alone until I pass.<br/>
<br/>
I am alone, etc. . .Singularly protected by the Almighty, until I pass all their nets and snares.<br/>
