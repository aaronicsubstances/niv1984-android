<p>THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
In the first, second, and third chapters of this Book are contained instructions and admonitions which St. John was commanded to write to the seven bishops of the churches in Asia.  And in the following chapters, to the end, are contained prophecies of things that are to come to pass in the Church of Christ, particularly towards the end of the world, in the time of Antichrist.  It was written in Greek, in the island of Patmos, where St. John was in banishment by order of the cruel emperor Domitian, about sixty-four years after our Lord's Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Apocalypse Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
St. John is ordered to write to the seven churches in Asia.  The manner of Christ's appearing to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass:  and signified, sending by his angel to his servant John,<br/>
<br/>
The things which must shortly come;. . .and again it is said, ver. 3, The time is at hand. . .This can not be meant of all the things prophesied in the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world.  That some things were to come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches, chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly.  Or that these words signified, that all time is short, and that from the coming of Christ, we are now in the last age or last hour.  See 1 John 2.18.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Who hath given testimony to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy: and keepeth those things which are written in it.  For the time is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. John to the seven churches which are in Asia.  Grace be unto you and peace, from him that is and that was and that is to come:  and from the seven spirits which are before his throne:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father.  To him be glory and empire for ever and ever.  Amen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him: and they also that pierced him.  And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him.  Even so.  Amen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.<br/>
<br/>
I am Alpha and Omega. . .These are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and signify the same as what follows: The beginning and the end:  the first cause and last end of all beings: who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. . .These words signify the true God only, and are here applied to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is to come again to judge the living and the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. I, John, your brother and your partner in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island which is called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Saying:  What thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven churches which are in Asia:  to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.  And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow. And his eyes were as a flame of fire:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace.  And his voice as the sound of many waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And he had in his right hand seven stars.  And from his mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword.  And his face was as the sun shineth in his power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead.  And he laid his right hand upon me, saying:  Fear not.  I am the First and the Last,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And alive, and was dead.  And behold I am living for ever and ever and have the keys of death and of hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. Write therefore the things which thou hast seen:  and which are: and which must be done hereafter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks.  The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.  And the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.<br/>

</b><br/>
Directions what to write to the angels or bishops of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus and Thyatira.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:1</span>. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write:  These things saith he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:2</span>. I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them that are evil.  And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and are not:  and hast found them liars:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:3</span>. And thou hast patience and hast endured for my name and hast not fainted.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:4</span>. But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first charity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:5</span>. Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen:  and do penance and do the first works.  Or else I come to thee and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:6</span>. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaites, which I also hate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:7</span>. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches:  To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of my God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:8</span>. And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write:  These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:9</span>. I know thy tribulation and thy poverty:  but thou art rich.  And thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:10</span>. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.  Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried:  and you shall have tribulation ten days.  Be thou faithful unto death:  and I will give thee the crown of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:11</span>. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches:  He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:12</span>. And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write:  These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:13</span>. I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is.  And thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith.  Even in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:14</span>. But I have against thee a few things:  because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat and to commit fornication.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:15</span>. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:16</span>. In like manner do penance.  If not, I will come to thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:17</span>. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches:  To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna and will give him a white counter:  and in the counter, a new name written, which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:18</span>. And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write:  These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire and his feet like to fine brass.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:19</span>. I know thy works and thy faith and thy charity and thy ministry and thy patience and thy last works, which are more than the former.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:20</span>. But I have against thee a few things:  because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed to idols.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:21</span>. And I gave her a time that she might do penance:  and she will not repent of her fornication.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:22</span>. Behold, I will cast her into a bed:  and they that commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:23</span>. And I will kill her children with death:  and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts.  And I will give to every one of you according to your works.  But to you I say<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:24</span>. And to the rest who are at Thyatira:  Whosoever have not this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say:  I will not put upon you any other burthen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:25</span>. Yet that which you have, hold fast till I come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:26</span>. And he that shall overcome and keep my words unto the end, I will give him power over the nations.<br/>
<br/>
Power over the nations. . .This shews, that the saints, who are with Christ our Lord in heaven, receive power from him to preside over nations and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the end of the world to execute his will against those who have not kept his commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:27</span>. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron:  and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:28</span>. As I also have received of my Father.  And I will give him the morning star.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">2:29</span>. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:2</span>. Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die.  For I find not thy works full before my God.<br/>
<br/>

The vision of the throne of God, the twenty-four ancients and the four living creatures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">4:1</span>. After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said:  Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:2</span>. And immediately I was in the spirit.  And behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:4</span>. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats:  and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments. And on their heads were crowns of gold.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:7</span>. And the first living creature was like a lion:  and the second living creature like a calf:  and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man:  and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:8</span>. And the four living creatures had each of them six wings:  and round about and within they are full of eyes.  And they rested not day and night, saying:  Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">5:3</span>. And no man was able, neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">5:4</span>. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">5:5</span>. And one of the ancients said to me:  Weep not:  behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">5:6</span>.

<br/>
The prayers of saints. . .Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">5:9</span>. And they sung a new canticle, saying:  Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book and to open the seals thereof:  because thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">5:10</span>. And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.<br/>

White horse. . .He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth to subdue the world by his gospel.  The other horses that follow represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies of Christ and his church.  The red horse signifies war; the black horse, famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or pestilence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">6:3</span>. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying:  Come and see.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">6:4</span>. And there went out another horse that was red.  And to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth:  and that they should kill one another.  And a great sword was given to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">6:5</span>. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying:  Come and see.  And behold a black horse.  And he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">6:6</span>. And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying:  Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two pounds of barley for a penny:  and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil.<br/>

And power was given to him over the four parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine and with death and with the beasts of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">6:9</span>. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.<br/>

Under the altar. . .Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls of the martyrs live in heaven, as their bodies are here deposited under our altars.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">6:10</span>. And they cried with a loud voice, saying:  How long, O Lord (Holy and True), dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?<br/>
<br/>
Revenge our blood. . .They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies, but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his elect.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">6:11</span>. And white robes were given to every one of them one; And it was said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow servants and their brethren, who are to be slain even as they, should be filled up.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">6:12</span>. And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal:  and behold there was a great earthquake.  And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair: and the whole moon became as blood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">6:13</span>. And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">6:14</span>. And the heaven departed as a book folded up.  And every mountain, and the islands, were moved out of their places.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">6:16</span>. And they say to the mountains and the rocks:  Fall upon us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.<br/>

Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit.  The vision of the army of horsemen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">9:1</span>. And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet:  and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth.  And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.<br/>
<br/>
A star full. . .This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith.  Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads.  And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. . .That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star.  To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">9:2</span>. And he opened the bottomless pit:  and the smoke of the pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace.  And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">9:3</span>. And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth.  And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.<br/>
<br/>
There came out locusts. . .These may be devils in Antichrist's time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described.  Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads.  Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc.  These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies.  Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant, etc.  Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists:  besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">9:4</span>. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree:  but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">9:5</span>. And it was given unto them that they should not kill them:  but that they should torment them five months.  And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">9:6</span>. And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it.  And they shall desire to die:  and death shall fly from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">9:7</span>. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle.  And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold:  and their faces were as the faces of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">9:8</span>. And they had hair as the hair of women:  and their teeth were as lions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">9:9</span>. And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron:  and the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">9:10</span>. And they had tails like to scorpions:  and there were stings in their tails.  And their power was to hurt men, five months.  And they had over them<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">9:11</span>. A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-175">9:15</span>. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year:  for to kill the third part of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-176">9:16</span>. And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand.  And I heard the number of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-177">9:17</span>. And thus I saw the horses in the vision.  And they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone.  And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions:  and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">9:18</span>. And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">9:19</span>. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.  For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads:  and with them they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">9:20</span>. And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk:<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Apocalypse Chapter 12</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-217"/>
<br/>
The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon her persecutor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">12:1</span>. And a great sign appeared in heaven:  A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br/>
<br/>
A woman. . .The church of God.  It may also, by allusion, be applied to our blessed Lady.  The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ:  she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet:  and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles:  she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">12:2</span>. And being with child, she cried travailing in birth:  and was in pain to be delivered.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">12:3</span>. And there was seen another sign in heaven.  And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">12:4</span>. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth.  And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered:  that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">12:5</span>. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod.  And her son was taken up to God and to his throne.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">12:6</span>. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her, a thousand two hundred sixty days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">12:7</span>. And there was a great battle in heaven:  Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">12:8</span>. And they prevailed not:  neither was their place found any more in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">12:9</span>. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world.  And he was cast unto the earth:  and his angels were thrown down with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">12:10</span>. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying:  Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ:  because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our God day and night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">12:11</span>. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of the testimony:  and they loved not their lives unto death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">12:12</span>. Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein.  Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">12:13</span>. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">12:14</span>. And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert, unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">12:15</span>. And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the woman, water, as it were a river:  that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">12:16</span>. And the earth helped the woman:  and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">12:17</span>. And the dragon was angry against the woman:  and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">12:18</span>. And he stood upon the sand of the sea.</p>

<p><b>Apocalypse Chapter 13</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-237"/>
<br/>
Of the beast with seven heads and of a second beast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">13:1</span>. And I saw a beast coming up out the sea, having seven heads and ten horns:  and upon his horns, ten diadems:  and upon his heads, names of blasphemy.<br/>
<br/>
A beast. . .This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world.  The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.:  the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies:  one was present, viz., the empire of Rome:  and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire.  The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-239">13:2</span>. And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard:  and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.  And the dragon gave him his own strength and great power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-240">13:3</span>. And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death:  and his death's wound was healed.  And all the earth was in admiration after the beast.<br/>
<br/>
One of his heads, etc. . .Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the Apostate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-241">13:4</span>. And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast.  And they adored the beast, saying:  Who is like to the beast?  And who shall be able to fight with him?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-242">13:5</span>. And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies:  and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-243">13:6</span>. And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
His tabernacle, etc. . .That is, his church and his saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-244">13:7</span>. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.  And power was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-245">13:8</span>. And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the beginning of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Slain from the beginning, etc. . .In the foreknowledge of God; and inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view of his death and passion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">13:9</span>. If any man have an ear, let him hear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">13:10</span>. He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity:  he that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword.  Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">13:11</span>. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth:  and he had two horns, like a lamb:  and he spoke as a dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Another beast. . .This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">13:12</span>. And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">13:13</span>. And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down from heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">13:14</span>. And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast:  saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which had the wound by the sword and lived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">13:15</span>. And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast:  and that the image of the beast should speak:  and should cause that whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">13:16</span>. And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on their foreheads:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">13:17</span>. And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">13:18</span>. Here is wisdom.  He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast.  For it is the number of a man:  and the number of him is six hundred sixty-six.<br/>
<br/>
Six hundred sixty-six. . .The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.</p>

Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him.  Of the judgments that shall fall upon the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-258">14:1</span>. And I beheld:  and lo a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-259">14:2</span>. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters and as the voice of great thunder.  And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">14:3</span>. And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients:  and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">14:4</span>. These are they who were not defiled with women:  for they are virgins.  These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.  These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">14:5</span>. And in their mouth there was found no lie:  for they are without spot before the throne of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">14:6</span>. And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over every nation and tribe and tongue and people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">14:7</span>. Saying with a loud voice:  Fear the Lord and give him honour, because the hour of his judgment is come.  And adore ye him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">14:8</span>. And another angel followed, saying:  That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.<br/>
<br/>
Babylon. . .By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked world in general, which God will punish, and destroy after the short time of this mortal life:  or it may signify every great city wherein enormous sins and abominations are daily committed; and that when the measure of its iniquities is full, the punishments due to its crimes are poured on it.  It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end of the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">14:9</span>. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice:  If any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character in his forehead or in his hand,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">14:10</span>. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath:  and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">14:11</span>. And the smoke of their torments, shall ascend up for ever and ever:  neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">14:12</span>. Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">14:13</span>. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me:  Write:  Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.  From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours.  For their works follow them.<br/>
<br/>
Die in the Lord. . .It is understood of the martyrs who die for the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">14:14</span>. And I saw:  and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp sickle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">14:15</span>. And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud:  Thrust in thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap.  For the harvest of the earth is ripe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">14:16</span>. And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth: and the earth was reaped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">14:17</span>. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">14:18</span>. And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire.  And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying:  Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes thereof are ripe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">14:19</span>. And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">14:20</span>. And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-319">17:7</span>. And the angel said to me:  Why dost thou wonder?  I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-320">17:8</span>. The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction.  And the inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not.<br/>
<br/>
The beast which thou sawest. . .This beast which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil:  which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist.  The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap. 13.1, and below, ver. 10.)  The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-321">17:9</span>. And here is the understanding that hath wisdom.  The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth:  and they are seven kings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-322">17:10</span>. Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come:  and when he is come, he must remain a short time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-323">17:11</span>. And the beast which was and is not:  the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-324">17:12</span>. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom:  but shall receive power as kings, one hour after the beast.<br/>
<br/>
Ten kings. . .Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the church of Christ: which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the justice of God for the punishment of Babylon.  Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of Rome.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-325">17:13</span>. These have one design:  and their strength and power they shall deliver to the beast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-326">17:14</span>. These shall fight with the Lamb.  And the Lamb shall overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings:  and they that are with him are called and elect and faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-327">17:15</span>. And he said to me:  The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-328">17:16</span>. And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast:  These shall hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-329">17:17</span>. For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth him:  that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-330">17:18</span>. And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth.<br/>

<br/>
I fell down before, etc. . .St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant.  St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.<br/>

Bound him, etc. . .The power of Satan has been very much limited by the passion of Christ:  for a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of the New Testament; but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the church, towards the end of the world.  During which time the souls of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory; as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of the general judgment.<br/>

<p><b>Apocalypse Chapter 22</b><br id="bookmark-drb1752-427"/>
<br/>
The water and tree of life.  The conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-428">22:1</span>. And he shewed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-429">22:2</span>. In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits every month:  the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">22:3</span>. And there shall be no curse any more:  but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it.  And his servants shall serve him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">22:4</span>. And they shall see his face:  and his name shall be on their foreheads.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">22:5</span>. And night shall be no more.  And they shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God shall enlighten then.  And they shall reign for ever and ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">22:6</span>. And he said to me:  These words are most faithful and true.  And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his servant the things which must be done shortly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">22:7</span>. And:  Behold I come quickly.  Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">22:8</span>. And I, John, who have heard and seen these things.  And, after I had heard and seen, I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel who shewed me the things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">22:9</span>. And he said to me:  See thou do it not.  For I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the words of the prophecy of this book.  Adore God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">22:10</span>. And he saith to me:  Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book.  For the time is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
For the time is at hand. . .That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration.  As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters.  Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world.  Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors.  Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men.  In fine, others think that St. John's design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general:  the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life.  In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events:  for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word.  Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot verba--parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiae.  Ep. ad Paulin, t. 4. p. 574.  Edit.  Benedict.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">22:11</span>. He that hurteth, let him hurt still:  and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still:  and he that is just, let him be justified still: and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still.<br/>
<br/>
Let him hurt still. . .It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in sin; but an intimation, that how far soever the wicked may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">22:12</span>. Behold, I come quickly:  and my reward is with me, to render to every, man according to his works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">22:13</span>. I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">22:14</span>. Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb: that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in by the gates into the city.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">22:15</span>. Without are dogs and sorcerers and unchaste and murderers and servers of idols and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">22:16</span>. I, Jesus, have sent my angel, to testify to you these things in the churches.  I am the root and stock of David, the bright and morning star.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">22:17</span>. And the spirit and the bride say:  Come.  And he that heareth, let him say:  Come.  And he that thirsteth, let him come.  And he that will, let him take the water of life, freely.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">22:18</span>. For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book:  If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">22:19</span>. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">22:20</span>. He that giveth testimony of these things, saith:  Surely, I come quickly:  Amen.  Come, Lord Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">22:21</span>. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.</p>
