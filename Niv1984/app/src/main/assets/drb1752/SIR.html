This Book is so called from a Greek word that signifies a preacher: because, like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all virtues.  The author was Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem, who flourished about two hundred years before Christ.  As it was written after the time of Esdras, it is not in the Jewish canon; but is received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church, instructed by apostolical tradition, and directed by the spirit of God.  It was first written in the Hebrew, but afterwards translated into Greek, by another Jesus, the grandson of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following:<br/>
<br/>
THE PROLOGUE.<br/>
<br/>
The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them:  for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned.  My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.  I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue.  And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language.  For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning.  Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.<br/>

<b>Ecclesiasticus Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
All wisdom is from God, and is given to them that fear and love God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world?  Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting commandments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who hath known her wise counsels?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest?  and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. The love of God is honourable wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the storehouses with her treasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. And it hath seen, and numbered her:  but both are the gifts of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord:  and the branches thereof are long-lived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">1:26</span>. In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge:  but to sinners wisdom is an abomination.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">1:27</span>. The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">1:28</span>. For he that is without fear, cannot be justified:  for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">1:29</span>. A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">1:30</span>. A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">1:31</span>. In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">1:32</span>. But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">1:33</span>. Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">1:34</span>. For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline:  and that which is agreeable to him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">1:35</span>. Is faith, and meekness:  and he will fill up his treasures.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">1:36</span>. Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord:  and come not to him with a double heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">1:37</span>. Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">1:38</span>. Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">1:39</span>. And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">1:40</span>. Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.</p>

God's servants must look for temptations:  and must arm themselves with patience and confidence in God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:1</span>. Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:2</span>. Humble thy heart, and endure:  incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding:  and make not haste in the time of clouds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:3</span>. Wait on God with patience:  join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:4</span>. Take all that shall be brought upon thee:  and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:5</span>. For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">2:11</span>. My children behold the generations of men:  and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.<br/>
<br/>

Lessons concerning the honour of parents, and humility, and avoiding curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:1</span>. The sons of wisdom are the church of the just:  and their generation, obedience and love.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:2</span>. Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:3</span>. For God hath made the father honourable to the children:  and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:4</span>. He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:5</span>. And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:6</span>. He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:8</span>. He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:9</span>. Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:10</span>. That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-79">3:11</span>. The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">3:13</span>. For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">4:17</span>. If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">4:18</span>. For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.<br/>
<br/>
In temptation, etc. . .The meaning is, that before wisdom will choose any for her favourite, she will try them by leading them through contradictions, afflictions, and temptations, the usual noviceship of the children of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">4:19</span>. She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial:  and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">4:20</span>. Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">4:21</span>. And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">4:22</span>. But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">5:1</span>. Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not:  I have enough to live on:  for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">6:20</span>. For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her fruits.<br/>

And restrain not grace from the dead. . .That is, withhold not from them the benefit of alms, prayers, and sacrifices.  Such was the doctrine and practice of the church of God even in the time of the Old Testament. And the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in the church of the New Testament.<br/>

Cautions with regard to women, and dangerous conversations.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">9:2</span>. Give not the power of thy soul to a woman, lest she enter upon thy strength, and thou be confounded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">9:3</span>. Look not upon a woman that hath a mind for many:  lest thou fall into her snares.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">9:4</span>. Use not much the company of her that is a dancer, and hearken not to her, lest thou perish by the force of her charms.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">9:8</span>. Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up, and gaze not about upon another's beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">9:9</span>. For many have perished by the beauty of a woman, and hereby lust is enkindled as a fire.<br/>

Lessons of humility and moderation in all things.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-332">11:2</span>. Praise not a man for his beauty, neither despise a man for his look.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-333">11:3</span>. The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-334">11:4</span>. Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour:  for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-335">11:5</span>. Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-343">11:13</span>. Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head:  and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.<br/>

Then shall he begin. . .God is so great and incomprehensible, that when man has done all that he can to find out his greatness and boundless perfections, he is still to begin:  for what he has found out, is but a mere nothing in comparison with his infinity.<br/>

Admonition against sundry vices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-578">19:1</span>. A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich:  and he that contemneth small things, shall fall by little and little.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-579">19:2</span>. Wine and women make wise men fall off, and shall rebuke the prudent:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-580">19:3</span>. And he that joineth himself to harlots, will be wicked. Rottenness and worms shall inherit him, and he shall be lifted up for a greater example, and his soul shall be taken away out of the number.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-581">19:4</span>. He that is hasty to give credit, is light of heart, and shall be lessened:  and he that sinneth against his own soul, shall be despised.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-582">19:5</span>. He that rejoiceth in iniquity, shall be censured, and he that hateth chastisement, shall have less life:  and he that hateth babbling, extinguisheth evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-583">19:6</span>. He that sinneth against his own soul, shall repent:  and he that is delighted with wickedness, shall be condemned.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-584">19:7</span>. Rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word, and thou shalt not fare the worse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-585">19:8</span>. Tell not thy mind to friend or foe:  and if there be a sin with thee, disclose it not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-586">19:9</span>. For he will hearken to thee, and will watch thee, and as it were defending thy sin he will hate thee, and so will he be with thee always.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-587">19:10</span>. Hast thou heard a word against thy neighbour?  let it die within thee, trusting that it will not burst thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-588">19:11</span>. At the hearing of a word the fool is in travail, as a woman groaning in the bringing forth a child.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-611">20:4</span>. How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so thou shalt escape wilful sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-612">20:5</span>. There is one that holdeth his peace, that is found wise:  and there is another that is hateful, that is bold in speech.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-617">20:10</span>. There is a gift that is not profitable:  and there is a gift, the recompense of which is double.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-643">21:1</span>. My son, hast thou sinned?  do so no more:  but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-657">21:15</span>. But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil:  and there is no understanding where there is bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-658">21:16</span>. The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood, and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-659">21:17</span>. The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, and no wisdom at all shall it hold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-660">21:18</span>. A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear, and will apply it to himself:  the luxurious man hath heard it, and it shall displease him, and he will cast it behind his back.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-661">21:19</span>. The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way:  but in the lips of the wise, grace shall be found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-662">21:20</span>. The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church, and they will think upon his words in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-663">21:21</span>. As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool:  and the knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-664">21:22</span>. Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-665">21:23</span>. A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter:  but a wise man will scarce laugh low to himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-666">21:24</span>. Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-667">21:25</span>. The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbour's house:  but a man of experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-668">21:26</span>. A fool will peep through the window into the house:  but he that is well taught will stand without.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-669">21:27</span>. It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door:  and a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-670">21:28</span>. The lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things:  but the words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-671">21:29</span>. The heart of fools is in their mouth:  and the mouth of wise men is in their heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-672">21:30</span>. While the ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own soul.<br/>
<br/>
While the ungodly, etc. . .He condemneth and curseth himself:  inasmuch as by sin he takes part with the devil, and is, as it were, his member and subject.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-673">21:31</span>. The talebearer shall defile his own soul, and shall be hated by all:  and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful:  the silent and wise man shall be honoured.<br/>

Wise sayings on divers subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-676">22:1</span>. The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone, and all men will speak of his disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-677">22:2</span>. The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen:  and every one that toucheth him will shake his hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-678">22:3</span>. A son ill taught is the confusion of the father:  and a foolish daughter shall be to his loss.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-679">22:4</span>. A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband:  but she that confoundeth, becometh a disgrace to her father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-680">22:5</span>. She that is bold shameth both her father and husband, and will not be inferior to the ungodly:  and shall be disgraced by them both.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-681">22:6</span>. A tale out of time is like music in mourning:  but the stripes and instruction of wisdom are never out of time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-682">22:7</span>. He that teacheth a fool, is like one that glueth a potsherd together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-683">22:8</span>. He that telleth a word to him that heareth not, is like one that waketh a man out of a deep sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-684">22:9</span>. He speaketh with one that is asleep, who uttereth wisdom to a fool:  and in the end of the discourse he saith:  Who is this?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-685">22:10</span>. Weep for the dead, for his light hath failed:  and weep for the fool, for his understanding faileth.<br/>
<br/>
For the fool. . .In the language of the Holy Ghost, he is styled a fool, that turns away from God to follow vanity and sin.  And what is said by the wise man against fools is meant of such fools as these.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-686">22:11</span>. Weep but a little for the dead, for he is at rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-687">22:12</span>. For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-688">22:13</span>. The mourning for the dead is seven days:  but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of their life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-689">22:14</span>. Talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no sense.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-690">22:15</span>. Keep thyself from him, that thou mayst not have trouble, and thou shalt not be defiled with his sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-691">22:16</span>. Turn away from him, and thou shalt find rest, and shalt not be wearied out with his folly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-692">22:17</span>. What is heavier than lead?  and what other name hath he but fool?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-693">22:18</span>. Sand and salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear, than a man without sense, that is both foolish and wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-694">22:19</span>. A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building, shall not be loosed:  so neither shall the heart that is established by advised counsel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-695">22:20</span>. The thought of him that is wise at all times, shall not be depraved by fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-696">22:21</span>. As pales set in high places, and plasterings made without cost, will not stand against the face of the wind:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-697">22:22</span>. So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not resist against the violence of fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-698">22:23</span>. As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-699">22:24</span>. He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears:  and he that pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-700">22:25</span>. He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away:  so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-701">22:26</span>. Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair not:  for there may be a returning.  To a friend,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-702">22:27</span>. If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation:  except upbraiding, and reproach, and pride, and disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound:  for in all these cases a friend will flee away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-703">22:28</span>. Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-706">22:31</span>. I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face:  and if any evil happen to me by him, I will bear it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-707">22:32</span>. But every one that shall hear it, will beware of him.<br/>

<p><b>Ecclesiasticus Chapter 23<br id="bookmark-drb1752-710"/>
</b><br/>
A prayer for grace to flee sin:  cautions against profane swearing and other vices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-711">23:1</span>. O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to their counsel:  nor suffer me to fall by them.<br/>
<br/>
By them. . .Viz., the tongue and the lips, mentioned in the last verse of the foregoing chapter.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-712">23:2</span>. Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and that their sins may not appear:<br/>
<br/>
That they spare me not in their ignorances, etc. . .That is, that the scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances, that is, the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and the lips.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-713">23:3</span>. Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-714">23:4</span>. O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-715">23:5</span>. Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all coveting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-716">23:6</span>. Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-717">23:7</span>. Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth, and he that will keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into most wicked works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-718">23:8</span>. A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil speakers shall fall thereby.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-719">23:9</span>. Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing:  for in it there are many falls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-720">23:10</span>. And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-721">23:11</span>. For as a slave daily put to the question, is never without a blue mark:  so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly pure from sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-722">23:12</span>. A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall not depart from his house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-723">23:13</span>. And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him, and if he dissemble it, he offendeth double:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-724">23:14</span>. And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified:  for his house shall be filled with his punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-725">23:15</span>. There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-726">23:16</span>. For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and they shall not wallow in sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-727">23:17</span>. Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech:  for therein is the word of sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-728">23:18</span>. Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest in the midst of great men:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-729">23:19</span>. Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily custom be infatuated and suffer reproach:  and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-730">23:20</span>. The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be corrected all the days of his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-731">23:21</span>. Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-732">23:22</span>. A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it devour some thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-733">23:23</span>. And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-734">23:24</span>. To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be weary of sinning unto the end.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-735">23:25</span>. Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own soul, and saying:  Who seeth me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-736">23:26</span>. Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man seeth me:  whom do I fear?  the most High will not remember my sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-737">23:27</span>. And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such a man's fear driveth him from the fear of God, and the eyes of men fearing him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-738">23:28</span>. And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-739">23:29</span>. For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created:  so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-740">23:30</span>. This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he shall be chased as a colt:  and where he suspected not, he shall be taken.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-741">23:31</span>. And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood not the fear of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-742">23:32</span>. So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-743">23:33</span>. For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband:  thirdly, she hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her children of another man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-744">23:34</span>. This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and inquisition shall be made of her children.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-745">23:35</span>. Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-746">23:36</span>. She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy shall not be blotted out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-747">23:37</span>. And they that remain shall know, that there is nothing better than the fear of God:  and that there is nothing sweeter than to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-748">23:38</span>. It is great glory to follow the Lord:  for length of days shall be received from him.</p>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-754">24:4</span>. And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-755">24:5</span>. I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-756">24:6</span>. I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-757">24:7</span>. I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-758">24:8</span>. I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-759">24:9</span>. And have stood in all the earth:  and in every people,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-760">24:10</span>. And in every nation I have had the chief rule:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-761">24:11</span>. And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low:  and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-762">24:12</span>. Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me:  and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-783">24:33</span>. Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-784">24:34</span>. He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.<br/>
<br/>
A most mighty king. . .Viz., Christ, who by his gospel, like an overflowing river, has enriched the earth with heavenly wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-785">24:35</span>. Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in the days of the new fruits.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-786">24:36</span>. Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-787">24:37</span>. Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as Gehon in the time of the vintage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-788">24:38</span>. Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker shall not search her out.<br/>
<br/>
Who first hath perfect knowledge of her. . .Christ was the first that had perfect knowledge of heavenly wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-789">24:39</span>. For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-790">24:40</span>. I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-791">24:41</span>. I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river, and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-792">24:42</span>. I said:  I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-793">24:43</span>. And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-794">24:44</span>. For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-795">24:45</span>. I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-796">24:46</span>. I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-797">24:47</span>. See ye that I have not laboured myself only, but for all that seek out the truth.<br/>

Documents of wisdom on several subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-800">25:1</span>. With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-801">25:2</span>. The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-802">25:3</span>. Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-803">25:4</span>. A poor man that is proud:  a rich man that is a liar:  an old man that is a fool, and doting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-804">25:5</span>. The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-805">25:6</span>. O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-806">25:7</span>. O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-807">25:8</span>. Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-808">25:9</span>. Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-809">25:10</span>. A man that hath joy of his children:  and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-810">25:11</span>. Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-811">25:12</span>. Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-812">25:13</span>. How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-813">25:14</span>. The fear of God hath set itself above all things:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-814">25:15</span>. Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-815">25:16</span>. The fear of God is the beginning of his love:  and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-816">25:17</span>. The sadness of the heart is every plague:  and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-817">25:18</span>. And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-818">25:19</span>. And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-819">25:20</span>. And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-820">25:21</span>. And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-821">25:22</span>. There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-822">25:23</span>. And there is no anger above the anger of a woman.  It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-823">25:24</span>. The wickedness of a woman changeth her face:  and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear:  and sheweth it like sackcloth.  In the midst of her neighbours,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-824">25:25</span>. Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-825">25:26</span>. All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-826">25:27</span>. As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-827">25:28</span>. Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-828">25:29</span>. A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-829">25:30</span>. A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-830">25:31</span>. A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-831">25:32</span>. Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-832">25:33</span>. From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-833">25:34</span>. Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little:  nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-834">25:35</span>. If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-835">25:36</span>. Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.</p>

Of good and bad women.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-838">26:1</span>. Happy is the husband of a good wife:  for the number of his years is double.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-839">26:2</span>. A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-840">26:3</span>. A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-841">26:4</span>. Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall be cheerful at all times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-842">26:5</span>. Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-843">26:6</span>. The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-844">26:7</span>. And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-845">26:8</span>. A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-846">26:9</span>. With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-847">26:10</span>. As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked woman:  he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-848">26:11</span>. A drunken woman is a great wrath:  and her reproach and shame shall not be hid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-849">26:12</span>. The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-850">26:13</span>. On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict watch: lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-851">26:14</span>. Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she slight thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-852">26:15</span>. She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-853">26:16</span>. The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-854">26:17</span>. Her discipline is the gift of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-855">26:18</span>. Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much worth as a well instructed soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-856">26:19</span>. A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-857">26:20</span>. And no price is worthy of a continent soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-858">26:21</span>. As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of God, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-859">26:22</span>. As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the beauty of the face in a ripe age,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-860">26:23</span>. As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet upon the soles of a steady woman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-861">26:24</span>. As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-862">26:25</span>. At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-863">26:26</span>. A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-864">26:27</span>. And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-865">26:28</span>. Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous:  a merchant is hardly free from negligence:  and a huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.<br/>
<br/>
From negligence. . .That is, from the neglect of the service of God: because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world, is apt to make men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.--Ibid.  A huckster. . .Or, a retailer of wine.  Men of that profession are both greatly exposed to danger of sin themselves, and are too often accessary to the sins of others.<br/>

Dangers of sin from several heads:  the fear of God is the best preservative.  He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-868">27:1</span>. Through poverty many have sinned:  and he that seeketh to be enriched, turneth away his eye.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-869">27:2</span>. As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick fast.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-870">27:3</span>. Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-871">27:4</span>. Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-872">27:5</span>. As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain:  so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-873">27:6</span>. The furnace trieth the potter's vessels, and the trial of affliction just men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-874">27:7</span>. As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-875">27:8</span>. Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the trial of men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-876">27:9</span>. If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her:  and shalt put her on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell with her:  and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowledgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-877">27:10</span>. Birds resort unto their like:  so truth will return to them that practise her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-878">27:11</span>. The lion always lieth in wait for prey:  so do sins for them that work iniquities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-879">27:12</span>. A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun:  but a fool is changed as the moon.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-880">27:13</span>. In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time:  but be continually among men that think.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-881">27:14</span>. The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-882">27:15</span>. The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head stand upright:  and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-883">27:16</span>. In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood:  and their cursing is a grievous hearing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-884">27:17</span>. He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-885">27:18</span>. Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with fidelity.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-886">27:19</span>. But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-887">27:20</span>. For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so is he that destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-888">27:21</span>. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-889">27:22</span>. Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-890">27:23</span>. Thou canst no more bind him up.  And of a curse there is reconciliation:<br/>

And of a curse there is reconciliation. . .That is, it is easier to obtain a reconciliation after a curse, than after disclosing a secret.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-891">27:24</span>. But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-892">27:25</span>. He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:<br/>

The vanity of dreams.  The advantage of experience, and of the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1111">34:3</span>. The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1156">35:15</span>. And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is judge, and there is not with him respect of person.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1157">35:16</span>. The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1160">35:19</span>. For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1161">35:20</span>. He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.<br/>

Of the choice of friends and counsellors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1200">37:1</span>. Every friend will say:  I also am his friend:  but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name.  Is not this a grief even to death?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1201">37:2</span>. But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1202">37:3</span>. O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1203">37:4</span>. There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1204">37:5</span>. There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1205">37:6</span>. Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1206">37:7</span>. Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1207">37:8</span>. Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1208">37:9</span>. Beware of a counsellor.  And know before what need he hath:  for he will devise to his own mind:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1209">37:10</span>. Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1210">37:11</span>. Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1211">37:12</span>. Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1212">37:13</span>. Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the field laborer of every work,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1213">37:14</span>. Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business:  give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1214">37:15</span>. But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1215">37:16</span>. Whose soul is according to thy own soul:  and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1216">37:17</span>. And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel:  for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1217">37:18</span>. The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1218">37:19</span>. But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1219">37:20</span>. In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1220">37:21</span>. A wicked word shall change the heart:  out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death:  and the tongue is continually the ruler of them.  There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1221">37:22</span>. A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1222">37:23</span>. He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful:  he shall be destitute of every thing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1223">37:24</span>. Grace is not given him from the Lord:  for he is deprived of all wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1224">37:25</span>. There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul:  and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1225">37:26</span>. A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1226">37:27</span>. A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1227">37:28</span>. The life of a man is in the number of his days:  but the days of Israel are innumerable.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1228">37:29</span>. A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1229">37:30</span>. My son, prove thy soul in thy life:  and if it be wicked, give it no power:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1230">37:31</span>. For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1231">37:32</span>. Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1232">37:33</span>. For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1482">45:3</span>. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him commandments in the sight of his people, and shewed him his glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1483">45:4</span>. He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose him out of all flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1484">45:5</span>. For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1485">45:6</span>. And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant, and Israel his judgments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1486">45:7</span>. He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1487">45:8</span>. He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in glory,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1488">45:9</span>. And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1489">45:10</span>. He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and an ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all round about,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1490">45:11</span>. That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1491">45:12</span>. He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a woven work of a wise man, endued with judgment and truth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1492">45:13</span>. Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1499">45:20</span>. He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to God, incense, and a good savour, for a memorial to make reconciliation for his people:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1500">45:21</span>. And he gave him power in his commandments, in the covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his testimonies, and give light to Israel in his law.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1501">45:22</span>. And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the wilderness, and the congregation of Core in their wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1502">45:23</span>. The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were consumed in his wrathful indignation.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1506">45:27</span>. But he shall not inherit among the people in the land, and he hath no portion among the people:  for he himself is his portion and inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1507">45:28</span>. Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1508">45:29</span>. And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people:  in the goodness and readiness of his soul he appeased God for Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1509">45:30</span>. Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1510">45:31</span>. And a covenant to David the king, the son of Jesse of the tribe of Juda, an inheritance to him and to his seed, that he might give wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice, that their good things might not be abolished, and he made their glory in their nation everlasting.<br/>

<br/>
Jesus the son of Nave. . .So Josue is named in the Greek Bibles.  For Josue and Jesus signify the same thing, viz., a saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1514">46:2</span>. Very great for the saving the elect of God, to overthrow the enemies that rose up against them, that he might get the inheritance for Israel.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1515">46:3</span>. How great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands, and stretched out swords against the cities?<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1522">46:10</span>. And they two being appointed, were delivered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1523">46:11</span>. And the Lord gave strength also to Caleb, and his strength continued even to his old age, so that he went up to the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an inheritance:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1561">47:24</span>. But God will not leave off his mercy, and he will not destroy, nor abolish his own works, neither will he cut up by the roots the offspring of his elect:  and he will not utterly take away the seed of him that loveth the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1562">47:25</span>. Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David of the same stock.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1563">47:26</span>. And Solomon had an end with his fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1564">47:27</span>. And he left behind him of his seed, the folly of the nation,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1565">47:28</span>. Even Roboam that had little wisdom, who turned away the people through his counsel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1566">47:29</span>. And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin, and their sins were multiplied exceedingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1567">47:30</span>. They removed them far away from their land.<br/>

The praise of Elias, of Eliseus, of Ezechias, and of Isaias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1571">48:1</span>. And Elias the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1572">48:2</span>. He brought a famine upon them, and they that provoked him in their envy, were reduced to a small number, for they could not endure the commandments of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1573">48:3</span>. By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and he brought down fire from heaven thrice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1574">48:4</span>. Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works.  And who can glory like to thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1575">48:5</span>. Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of death, by the word of the Lord God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1576">48:6</span>. Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest easily their power in pieces, and the glorious from their bed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1577">48:7</span>. Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments of vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1578">48:8</span>. Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets successors after thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1579">48:9</span>. Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1580">48:10</span>. Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the wrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1581">48:11</span>. Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with thy friendship.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1582">48:12</span>. For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not be such.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1583">48:13</span>. Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind, and his spirit was filled up in Eliseus:  in his days he feared not the prince, and no man was more powerful than he.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1584">48:14</span>. No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1585">48:15</span>. In his life he did great wonders, and in death he wrought miracles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1586">48:16</span>. For all this the people repented not, neither did they depart from their sins till they were cast out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1587">48:17</span>. And there was left but a small people, and a prince in the house of David.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1588">48:18</span>. Some of these did that which pleased God:  but others committed many sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1589">48:19</span>. Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1590">48:20</span>. In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion, and became proud through his power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1591">48:21</span>. Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in pain as women in travail.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1592">48:22</span>. And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven:  and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1593">48:23</span>. He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1594">48:24</span>. He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the Lord destroyed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1595">48:25</span>. For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in the way of David his father, which Isaias, the great prophet, and faithful in the sight of God, had commanded him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1596">48:26</span>. In his days the sun wen backward, and he lengthened the king's life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1597">48:27</span>. With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass at last, and comforted the mourners in Sion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1598">48:28</span>. He showed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things before they came.<br/>

The praise of Josias, of Jeremias, Ezechiel, and the twelve prophets. Also of Zorobabel, Jesus the son of Josedech, Nehemias, Enoch, Joseph, Seth, Sem, and Adam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1601">49:1</span>. The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made by the art of a perfumer:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1602">49:2</span>. His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1603">49:3</span>. He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1604">49:4</span>. And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened godliness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1605">49:5</span>. Except David, and Ezechias and Josias, all committed sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1606">49:6</span>. For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1607">49:7</span>. So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1608">49:8</span>. They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1609">49:9</span>. For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet from his mother's womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1610">49:10</span>. It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1611">49:11</span>. For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1612">49:12</span>. And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place:  for they strengthened Jacob, and redeemed themselves by strong faith.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1613">49:13</span>. How shall we magnify Zorobabel?  for he was as a signet on the right hand;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1614">49:14</span>. In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1615">49:15</span>. And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1616">49:16</span>. No man was born upon earth like Henoch:  for he also was taken up from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1617">49:17</span>. Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people:<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1618">49:18</span>. And his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied.<br/>
<br/>
They prophesied. . .That is, by their being carried out of Egypt they verified the prophetic prediction of Joseph.  Gen. 50.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1623">50:2</span>. By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1624">50:3</span>. In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1625">50:4</span>. He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1626">50:5</span>. He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained glory in his conversation with the people:  and enlarged the entrance of the house and the court.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1627">50:6</span>. He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1628">50:7</span>. And as the sun when it shineth, so did he shine in the temple of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1629">50:8</span>. And as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1630">50:9</span>. As a bright fire, and frankincense burning in the fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1631">50:10</span>. As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1632">50:11</span>. As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the perfection of power.<br/>
<br/>
Clothed with the perfection of power. . .That is, with all the vestments denoting his dignity and authority.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1633">50:12</span>. When he went up to the holy altar, he honoured the vesture of holiness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1634">50:13</span>. And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the altar.  And about him was the ring of his brethren:  and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1635">50:14</span>. And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1636">50:15</span>. And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel:  and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high King,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1637">50:16</span>. He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1638">50:17</span>. He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1639">50:18</span>. Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1640">50:19</span>. Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1641">50:20</span>. And the singers lifted up their voices, and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1644">50:23</span>. And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1645">50:24</span>. And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1648">50:27</span>. There are two nations which my soul abhorreth:  and the third is no nation:  which I hate:<br/>
<br/>
Abhorreth. . .Viz., with a holy indignation, as enemies of God and persecutors of his people.  Such were then the Edomites who abode in mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-1649">50:28</span>. They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem.<br/>
