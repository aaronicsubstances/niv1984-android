<p>SOLOMON'S CANTICLE OF CANTICLES<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is called the Canticle of Canticles, that is to say, the most excellent of all canticles:  because it is full of high mysteries, relating to the happy union of Christ and his spouse:  which is here begun by love; and is to be eternal in heaven.  The spouse of Christ is the church:  more especially as to the happiest part of it, viz., perfect souls, every one of which is his beloved, but, above all others, the immaculate and ever blessed virgin mother.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Canticle of Canticles Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The spouse aspires to an union with Christ, their mutual love for one another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth:  for thy breasts are better than wine,<br/>
<br/>
Let him kiss me. . .The church, the spouse of Christ, prays that he may love and have peace with her, which the spouse prefers to every thing delicious:  and therefore expresses (ver. 2) that young maidens, that is the souls of the faithful, have loved thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. Smelling sweet of the best ointments.  Thy name is as oil poured out:  therefore young maidens have loved thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. Draw me:  we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments.  The king hath brought me into his storerooms:  we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine:  the rightous love thee.<br/>
<br/>
Draw me. . .That is, with thy grace:  otherwise I should not be able to come to thee.  This metaphor shews that we cannot of ourselves come to Christ our Lord, unless he draws us by his grace, which is laid up in his storerooms:  that is, in the mysteries of Faith, which God in his goodness and love for mankind hath revealed, first by his servant Moses in the Old Law in figure only, and afterwards in reality by his only begotten Son Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.<br/>
<br/>
I am black but beautiful. . .That is, the church of Christ founded in humility appearing outwardly afflicted, and as it were black and contemptible; but inwardly, that is, in its doctrine and morality, fair and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour:  the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards:  my vineyard I have not kept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.<br/>
<br/>
If thou know not thyself, etc. . .Christ encourages his spouse to follow and watch her flock:  and though she know not entirely the power at hand to assist her, he tells her, ver. 8, my company of horsemen, that is, his angels, are always watching and protecting her.  And in the following verses he reminds her of the virtues and gifts with which he has endowed her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. Behold thou are fair, O my love, behold thou are fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely.  Our bed is flourishing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.</p>

</b><br/>
Christ caresses his spouse:  he invites her to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:1</span>. I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.<br/>
<br/>
I am the flower of the field. . .Christ professes himself the flower of mankind, yea, the Lord of all creatures:  and, ver. 2, declares the excellence of his spouse, the true church above all other societies, which are to be considered as thorns.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:2</span>. As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:3</span>. As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons.  I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired:  and his fruit was sweet to my palate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:4</span>. He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:5</span>. Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples:  because I languish with love.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:6</span>. His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:7</span>. I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the field, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:8</span>. The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.<br/>
<br/>
The voice of my beloved:  that is, the preaching of the gospel surmounting difficulties figuratively here expressed by mountains and little hills.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:9</span>. My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart.  Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:10</span>. Behold my beloved speaketh to me:  Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:11</span>. For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:12</span>. The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come:  the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:13</span>. The fig tree hath put forth her green figs:  the vines in flower yield their sweet smell.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:14</span>. My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears:  for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:15</span>. Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines:  for our vineyard hath flourished.<br/>
<br/>
Catch us the little foxes. . .Christ commands his pastors to catch false teachers, by holding forth their fallacy and erroneous doctrine, which like foxes would bite and destroy the vines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:16</span>. My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:17</span>. Till the day break, and the shadows retire.  Return:  be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">7:7</span>. Thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">7:8</span>. I said:  I will go up into the palm tree, and will take hold of the fruit thereof:  and thy breasts shall be as the clusters of the vine: and the odour of thy mouth like apples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">7:9</span>. Thy throat like the best wine, worthy for my beloved to drink, and for his lips and his teeth to ruminate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">7:10</span>. I to my beloved, and his turning is towards me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">7:11</span>. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field, let us abide in the villages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">7:12</span>. Let us get up early to the vineyards, let us see if the vineyard flourish, if the flowers be ready to bring forth fruits, if the pomegranates flourish:  there will I give thee my breasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">7:13</span>. The mandrakes give a smell.  In our gates are all fruits:  the new and the old, my beloved, I have kept for thee.<br/>

<p><b>Canticle of Canticles Chapter 8<br id="bookmark-drb1752-117"/>
</b><br/>
The love of the church to Christ:  his love to her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">8:1</span>. Who shall give thee to me for my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother, that I may find thee without, and kiss thee, and now no man may despise me?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">8:2</span>. I will take hold of thee, and bring thee into my mother's house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">8:3</span>. His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.<br/>
<br/>
His left hand, etc. . .Words of the church to Christ.  His left hand, signifying the Old Testament, and his right hand, the New.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">8:4</span>. I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love till she please.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">8:5</span>. Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved?  Under the apple tree I raised thee up:  there thy mother was corrupted, there she was defloured that bore thee.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this, etc. . .The angels with admiration behold the Gentiles converted to the faith:  coming up from the desert, that is, coming from heathenism and false worship:  flowing with delights, that is, abounding with good works which are pleasing to God:  leaning on her beloved, on the promise of Christ to his Church, that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; and supported by his grace conferred by the sacraments.  Under the apple tree I raised thee up; that is, that Christ redeemed the Gentiles at the foot of the cross, where the synagogue of the Jews (the mother church) was corrupted by their denying him, and crucifying him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">8:6</span>. Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy as hard as hell, the lamps thereof are fire and flames.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">8:7</span>. Many waters cannot quench charity, neither can the floods drown it:  if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, he shall despise it as nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">8:8</span>. Our sister is little, and hath no breasts.  What shall we do to our sister in the day when she is to be spoken to?<br/>
<br/>
Our sister is little, etc. . .Mystically signifies the Jews, who are to be spoken to:  that is, converted towards the end of the world:  and then shall become a wall, that is, a part of the building, the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">8:9</span>. If she be a wall:  let us build upon it bulwarks of silver:  if she be a door, let us join it together with boards of cedar.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">8:10</span>. I am a wall:  and my breasts are as a tower since I am become in his presence as one finding peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">8:11</span>. The peaceable had a vineyard, in that which hath people:  he let out the same to keepers, every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of silver.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">8:12</span>. My vineyard is before me.  A thousand are for thee, the peaceable, and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">8:13</span>. Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the friends hearken:  make me hear thy voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">8:14</span>. Flee away, O my beloved, and be like to the roe, and to the young hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices.<br/>
