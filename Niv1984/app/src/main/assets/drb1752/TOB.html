<p>THE BOOK OF TOBIAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book takes its name from the holy man Tobias, whose wonderful virtues are herein recorded.  It contains most excellent documents of great piety, extraordinary patience, and of a perfect resignation to the will of God.  His humble prayer was heard, and the angel Raphael was sent to relieve him:  he is thankful and praises the Lord, calling on the children of Israel to do the same.  Having lived to the age of one hundred and two years, he exhorts his son and grandsons to piety, foretells the destruction of Ninive and the rebuilding of Jerusalem:  he dies happily.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tobias Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
Tobias's early piety:  his works of mercy, particularly in burying the dead.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Tobias of the tribe and city of Nephtali, (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Naasson, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet,)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. But every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow captives, that were of his kindred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephtali, yet did he no childish thing in his work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his firstfruits, and his tithes,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And when by the captivity he with his wife and his son and all his tribe was come to the city of Ninive,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. (When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul and never was defiled with their meats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. He therefore went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. And when he was come to Rages a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. But after a long time, Salmanasar the king being dead, when Sennacherib his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. Tobias daily went among all his kindred and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And when king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea by reason of the slaughter that God had made about him for his blasphemy, and being angry slew many of the children of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">1:22</span>. But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">1:23</span>. But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife, lay concealed, for many loved him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">1:24</span>. But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">1:25</span>. And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-27-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Tobias Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-28"/>
</b><br/>
Tobias leaveth his dinner to bury the dead:  he loseth his sight by God's permission, for manifestation of his patience.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:1</span>. But after this, when there was a festival of the Lord, and a good dinner was prepared in Tobias's house,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:2</span>. He said to his son:  Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear God, to feast with us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:3</span>. And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street.  And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:4</span>. And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:5</span>. And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:6</span>. Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by Amos the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:7</span>. So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:8</span>. Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying:  once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:9</span>. But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:10</span>. Now it happened one day that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:11</span>. And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow's nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:12</span>. Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:13</span>. For whereas he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against God because the evil of blindness had befallen him,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:14</span>. But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:15</span>. For as the kings insulted over holy Job:  so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:<br/>
<br/>
Kings. . .So Job's three friends are here called, because they were princes in their respective territories.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:16</span>. Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">2:17</span>. But Tobias rebuked them, saying:  Speak not so:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">2:18</span>. For we are the children of saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">2:19</span>. Now Anna his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">2:20</span>. Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">2:21</span>. And when her husband heard it bleating, he said:  Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen:  restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">2:22</span>. At these words his wife being angry answered:  It is evident the hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">2:23</span>. And with these and other, such like words she upbraided him.</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-52-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Tobias Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-53"/>
</b><br/>
The prayer of Tobias, and of Sara, in their several afflictions, are heard by God, and the angel Raphael is sent to relieve them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:1</span>. Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:2</span>. Saying, Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:3</span>. And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offences, nor those of my parents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:4</span>. For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:5</span>. And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:6</span>. And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace:  for it is better for me to die, than to live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:7</span>. Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in Rages a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father's servant maids,<br/>
<br/>
Rages. . .In the Greek it is Ecbatana, which was also called Rages.  For there were two cities in Media of the name of Rages.  Raguel dwelt in one of them, and Gabelus in the other.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:8</span>. Because she had been given to seven husbands and a devil named Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:9</span>. So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying:  May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:10</span>. Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands?  At these words, she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">3:11</span>. But continuing in prayer with tears besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">3:12</span>. And it came to pass on the third day when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-66">3:13</span>. She said:  Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers, who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-67">3:14</span>. To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">3:15</span>. I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">3:16</span>. Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">3:17</span>. Never have I joined myself with them that play:  neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">3:18</span>. But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">3:19</span>. And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me:  because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">3:20</span>. For thy counsel is not in man's power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">3:21</span>. But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered:  and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">3:22</span>. For thou art not delighted in our being lost, because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">3:23</span>. Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">3:24</span>. At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-78">3:25</span>. And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.<br/>
</p>
<div id="bookmark-drb1752-79-n"><hr/><hr/></div>
<p><b>Tobias Chapter 4<br id="bookmark-drb1752-80"/>
</b><br/>
Tobias thinking he shall die, giveth his son godly admonitions:  and telleth him of money he had lent to a friend.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:1</span>. Therefore when Tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias his son,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:2</span>. And said to him:  Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a foundation in thy heart.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-83">4:3</span>. When God shall take my soul, thou shalt bury my body:  and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:4</span>. For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:5</span>. And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:6</span>. And all the days of thy life have God in thy mind:  and take heed thou never consent to sin, nor transgress the commandments of the Lord our God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-87">4:7</span>. Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person:  for so it shall come to pass that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-88">4:8</span>. According to thy ability be merciful.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-89">4:9</span>. If thou have much give abundantly:  if thou have little, take care even so to bestow willingly a little.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-90">4:10</span>. For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of necessity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-91">4:11</span>. For alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-92">4:12</span>. Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-93">4:13</span>. Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">4:14</span>. Never suffer pride to reign in thy mind, or in thy words:  for from it all perdition took its beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-95">4:15</span>. If any man hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-96">4:16</span>. See thou never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-97">4:17</span>. Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-98">4:18</span>. Lay out thy bread, and thy wine upon the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-99">4:19</span>. Seek counsel always of a wise man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">4:20</span>. Bless God at all times:  and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">4:21</span>. I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages a city of the Medes, and I have a note of his hand with me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-102">4:22</span>. Now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the foresaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-103">4:23</span>. Fear not, my son:  we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many good things if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.<br/>

<p><b>Tobias Chapter 5<br id="bookmark-drb1752-105"/>
</b><br/>
Young Tobias seeking a guide for his journey, the angel Raphael, in shape of a man, undertaketh this office.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-106">5:1</span>. Then Tobias answered his father, and said:  I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-107">5:2</span>. But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me, and I know not him:  what token shall I give him?  nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-108">5:3</span>. Then his father answered him, and said:  I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-109">5:4</span>. But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire:  that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-110">5:5</span>. Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-111">5:6</span>. And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said:  From whence art thou, good young man?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-112">5:7</span>. But he answered:  Of the children of Israel.  And Tobias said to him:  Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-113">5:8</span>. And he answered:  I know it:  and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-114">5:9</span>. And Tobias said to him:  Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-115">5:10</span>. Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father.  Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-116">5:11</span>. So going in he saluted him, and said:  Joy be to thee always.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-117">5:12</span>. And Tobias said:  What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness and see not the light of heaven?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-118">5:13</span>. And the young man said to him:  Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-119">5:14</span>. And Tobias said to him:  Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the Medes?  and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-120">5:15</span>. And the angel said to him:  I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-121">5:16</span>. And Tobias said to him:  I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-122">5:17</span>. And Raphael the angel answered:  Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-123">5:18</span>. But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias.<br/>
<br/>
Azarias. . .The angel took the form of Azarias:  and therefore might call himself by the name of the man whom he personated.  Azarias, in Hebrew, signifies the help of God, and Ananias the grace of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-124">5:19</span>. And Tobias answered:  Thou art of a great family.  But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-125">5:20</span>. And the angel said to him:  I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-126">5:21</span>. And Tobias answering, said:  May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-127">5:22</span>. Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-128">5:23</span>. And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say:  Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">5:24</span>. I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">5:25</span>. For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">5:26</span>. And Tobias said to her:  Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">5:27</span>. For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">5:28</span>. At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</p>

By the angel's advice young Tobias taketh hold on a fish that assaulteth him.  Reserveth the heart, the gall, and the liver for medicines.  They lodge at the house of Raguel, whose daughter Sara, Tobias is to marry; she had before been married to seven husbands, who were all slain by a devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">6:1</span>. And Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">6:2</span>. And he went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">6:3</span>. And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying:  Sir, he cometh upon me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">6:4</span>. And the angel said to him:  Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee.  And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">6:5</span>. Then the angel said to him:  Take out the entrails of this fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee:  for these are necessary for useful medicines.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">6:6</span>. And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way:  the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages the city of the Medes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">6:7</span>. Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him:  I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-143">6:8</span>. And the angel, answering, said to him:  If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them.<br/>
<br/>
Its heart, etc.  The liver (ver. 19). . .God was pleased to give these things a virtue against those proud spirits, to make them, who affected to be like the Most High, subject to such mean corporeal creatures as instruments of his power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-144">6:9</span>. And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">6:10</span>. And Tobias said to him:  Where wilt thou that we lodge?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">6:11</span>. And the angel answering, said:  Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">6:12</span>. All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">6:13</span>. Ask her therefore of her father, and he will give her thee to wife.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">6:14</span>. Then Tobias answered, and said:  I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died:  moreover I have heard, that a devil killed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">6:15</span>. Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me also: and whereas I am the only child of my parents, I should bring down their old age with sorrow to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Hell. . .That is, to the place where the souls of the good were kept before the coming of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">6:16</span>. Then the angel Raphael said to him:  Hear me, and I will shew thee who they are, over whom the devil can prevail.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">6:17</span>. For they who in such manner receive matrimony, as to shut out God from themselves, and from their mind, and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule, which have not understanding, over them the devil hath power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">6:18</span>. But thou when thou shalt take her, go into the chamber, and for three days keep thyself continent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to prayers with her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">6:19</span>. And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the devil shall be driven away.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">6:20</span>. But the second night thou shalt be admitted into the society of the holy Patriarchs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">6:21</span>. And the third night thou shalt obtain a blessing that sound children may be born of you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">6:22</span>. And when the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin with the fear of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that in the seed of Abraham thou mayst obtain a blessing in children.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">7:1</span>. And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">7:2</span>. And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to Anna his wife:  How like is this young man to my cousin?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">7:3</span>. And when he had spoken these words, he said:  Whence are ye young men our brethren?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">7:4</span>. But they said:  We are of the tribe of Nephtali, of the captivity of Ninive.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:7</span>. And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears and weeping upon his neck, said:  A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">7:8</span>. And Anna his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">7:9</span>. And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared.  And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,<br/>

Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her:  and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner:  and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">7:12</span>. The angel said to him:  Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God is thy daughter due to be his wife:  therefore another could not have her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">7:13</span>. Then Raguel said:  I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">7:14</span>. And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, according to the law of Moses:  and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">7:15</span>. And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying:  The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his blessing in you.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">8:3</span>. Then the angel Raphael took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">8:4</span>. Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her:  Sara, arise, and let us pray to God to day, and to morrow, and the next day:  because for these three nights we are joined to God:  and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">8:7</span>. And Tobias said:  Lord God of our fathers, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">8:8</span>. Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve for a helper.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">8:10</span>. Sara also said:  Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">8:11</span>. And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">8:15</span>. So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-197">8:16</span>. And returning she brought the good news:  and Raguel and Anna his wife blessed the Lord,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-198">8:17</span>. And said:  We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we suspected.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">8:18</span>. For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">8:20</span>. And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.<br/>

The dog, etc. . .This may seem a very minute circumstance to be recorded in sacred history:  but as we learn from our Saviour, St. Matt. 5.18, there are iotas and tittles in the word of God:  that is to say, things that appear minute, but which have indeed a deep and mysterious meaning in them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-246">11:10</span>. And his father that was blind, rising up, began to run stumbling with his feet:  and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-247">11:11</span>. And receiving him kissed him, as did also his wife, and they began to weep for joy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-248">11:12</span>. And when they had adored God, and given him thanks, they sat down together.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-249">11:13</span>. Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-250">11:14</span>. And he stayed about half an hour:  and a white skin began to come out of his eyes, like the skin of an egg.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-251">11:15</span>. And Tobias took hold of it, and drew it from his eyes, and recovered his sight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-252">11:16</span>. And they glorified God, both he and his wife and all that knew him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-253">11:17</span>. And Tobias said:  I bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saved me and behold I see Tobias my son.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-254">11:18</span>. And after seven days Sara his son's wife and all the family arrived safe, and the cattle, and the camels, and an abundance of money of his wife's:  and that money also which he had received of Gabelus,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-255">11:19</span>. And he told his parents all the benefits of God, which he had done to him by the man that conducted him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-256">11:20</span>. And Achior and Nabath the kinsmen of Tobias came, rejoicing for Tobias, and congratulating with him for all the good things that God had done for him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-257">11:21</span>. And for seven days they feasted and rejoiced all with great joy.</p>

<p><b>Tobias Chapter 12<br id="bookmark-drb1752-259"/>
</b><br/>
Raphael maketh himself known.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-260">12:1</span>. Then Tobias called to him his son and said to him:  What can we give to this holy man, that is come with thee?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-261">12:2</span>. Tobias answering, said to his father:  Father, what wages shall we give him?  or what can be worthy of his benefits?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-262">12:3</span>. He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good things through him.  What can we give him sufficient for these things?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-263">12:4</span>. But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept of one half of all things that have been brought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-264">12:5</span>. So the father and the son calling him, took him aside:  and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-265">12:6</span>. Then he said to them secretly, Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-266">12:7</span>. For it is good to hide the secret of a king:  to reveal and confess the works of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-267">12:8</span>. Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-268">12:9</span>. For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-269">12:10</span>. But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-270">12:11</span>. I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-271">12:12</span>. When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-272">12:13</span>. And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-273">12:14</span>. And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son's wife from the devil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-274">12:15</span>. For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-275">12:16</span>. And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-276">12:17</span>. And the angel said to them:  Peace be to you, fear not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-277">12:18</span>. For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God:  bless ye him, and sing praises to him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-278">12:19</span>. I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-279">12:20</span>. It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me:  but bless ye God, and publish all his wonderful works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-280">12:21</span>. And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-281">12:22</span>. Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God, and rising up, they told all his wonderful works.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-284">13:1</span>. And Tobias the elder opening his mouth, blessed the Lord, and said:  Thou art great O Lord, for ever, and thy kingdom is unto all ages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-285">13:2</span>. For thou scourgest, and thou savest:  thou leadest down to hell, and bringest up again:  and there is none that can escape thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-286">13:3</span>. Give glory to the Lord, ye children of Israel, and praise him in the sight of the Gentiles:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-287">13:4</span>. Because he hath therefore scattered you among the Gentiles, who know not him, that you may declare his wonderful works, and make them know that there is no other almighty God besides him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-288">13:5</span>. He hath chastised us for our iniquities:  and he will save us for his own mercy.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-290">13:7</span>. As for me, I will praise him in the land of my captivity:  because he hath shewn his majesty toward a sinful nation,<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-294">13:11</span>. Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord hath chastised thee for the works of thy hands.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem. . .What is prophetically delivered here, and in the following chapter, with relation to Jerusalem, is partly to be understood of the rebuilding of the city after the captivity:  and partly of the spiritual Jerusalem, which is the church of Christ, and the eternal Jerusalem in heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-295">13:12</span>. Give glory to the Lord for thy good things, and bless the God eternal that he may rebuild his tabernacle in thee, and may call back all the captives to thee, and thou mayst rejoice for ever and ever.<br/>

Old Tobias dieth at the age of a hundred and two years, after exhorting his son and grandsons to piety, foreshewing that Ninive shall be destroyed, and Jerusalem rebuilt.  The younger Tobias returneth with his family to Raguel, and dieth happily as he had lived.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-309">14:1</span>. And the words of Tobias were ended.  And after Tobias was restored to his sight, he lived two and forty years, and saw the children of his grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-310">14:2</span>. And after he had lived a hundred and two years, he was buried honorably in Ninive.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-311">14:3</span>. For he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his eyes, and sixty when he recovered it again.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-312">14:4</span>. And the rest of his life was in joy, and with great increase of the fear of God he departed in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-313">14:5</span>. And at the hour of his death he called unto him his son Tobias and his children, seven young men, his grandsons, and said to them:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-314">14:6</span>. The destruction of Ninive is at hand:  for the word of the Lord must be fulfilled:  and our brethren, that are scattered abroad from the land of Israel, shall return to it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-315">14:7</span>. And all the land thereof that is desert shall be filled with people, and the house of God which is burnt in it, shall again be rebuilt:  and all that fear God shall return thither.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-316">14:8</span>. And the Gentiles shall leave their idols, and shall come into Jerusalem, and shall dwell in it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-317">14:9</span>. And all the kings of the earth shall rejoice in it, adoring the King of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-318">14:10</span>. Hearken therefore, my children, to your father:  serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do the things that please him:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-319">14:11</span>. And command your children that they do justice and almsdeeds, and that they be mindful of God, and bless him at all times in truth, and with all their power.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-320">14:12</span>. And now, children, hear me, and do not stay here:  but as soon as you shall bury your mother by me in one sepulchre, without delay direct your steps to depart hence:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-321">14:13</span>. For I see that its iniquity will bring it to destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-322">14:14</span>. And it came to pass that after the death of his mother, Tobias departed out of Ninive with his wife, and children, and children's children, and returned to his father and mother in law.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-323">14:15</span>. And he found them in health in a good old age:  and he took care of them, and he closed their eyes:  and all the inheritance of Raguel's house came to him:  and he saw his children's children to the fifth generation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-324">14:16</span>. And after he had lived ninety-nine years in the fear of the Lord, with joy they buried him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-325">14:17</span>. And all his kindred, and all his generation continued in good life, and in holy conversation, so that they were acceptable both to God, and to men, and to all that dwelt in the land.<br/>
