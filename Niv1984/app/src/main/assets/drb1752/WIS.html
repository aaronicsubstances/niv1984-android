<p>THE BOOK OF WISDOM<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
This Book is so called, because it treats of the excellence of WISDOM, the means to obtain it, and the happy fruits it produces.  It is written in the person of Solomon, and contains his sentiments.  But it is uncertain who was the writer.  It abounds with instructions and exhortations to kings and all magistrates to minister justice in the commonwealth, teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of justice and wisdom.  It contains also many prophecies of Christ's coming, passion, resurrection, and other Christian mysteries.  The whole may be divided into three parts.  In the first six chapters, the author admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom.  In the next three, he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from God, and is procured by prayer and a good life.  In the other ten chapters, he sheweth the excellent effects and utility of wisdom and justice.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wisdom Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
An exhortation to seek God sincerely, who cannot be deceived, and desireth not our death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth.  Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. For he is found by them that tempt him not:  and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. For perverse thoughts separate from God:  and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips:  for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world:  and that which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought:  and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. For he created all things that they might be:  and he made the nations of the earth for health:  and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. For justice is perpetual and immortal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. But the wicked with works and words have called it to them:  and esteeming it a friend, have fallen away and have made a covenant with it:  because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.<br/>

<p><b>Wisdom Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-19"/>
</b><br/>
The vain reasonings of the wicked:  their persecuting the just, especially the Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">2:1</span>. For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right:  The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">2:2</span>. For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been:  for the breath in our nostrils is smoke:  and speech a spark to move our heart,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">2:3</span>. Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-23">2:4</span>. And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-24">2:5</span>. For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end:  for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:6</span>. Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:7</span>. Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments:  and let not the flower of the time pass by us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:8</span>. Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered:  let no meadow escape our riot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:9</span>. Let none of us go without his part in luxury:  let us every where leave tokens of joy:  for this is our portion, and this our lot.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:10</span>. Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:11</span>. But let our strength be the law of justice:  for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:12</span>. Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:13</span>. He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:14</span>. He is become a censurer of our thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:15</span>. He is grievous unto us, even to behold:  for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are very different.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:16</span>. We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:17</span>. Let us see then if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen to him, and we shall know what his end shall be.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:18</span>. For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-38">2:19</span>. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures, that we may know his meekness, and try his patience.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-39">2:20</span>. Let us condemn him to a most shameful death:  for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">2:21</span>. These things they thought, and were deceived:  for their own malice blinded them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">2:22</span>. And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">2:23</span>. For God created man incorruptible, and to the image of his own likeness he made him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">2:24</span>. But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">2:25</span>. And they follow him that are of his side.</p>

The happiness of the just:  and the unhappiness of the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:1</span>. But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:2</span>. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die:  and their departure was taken for misery:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:3</span>. And their going away from us, for utter destruction:  but they are in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-50">3:4</span>. And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-51">3:5</span>. Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">3:6</span>. As gold in the furnace, he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust, he hath received them, and in time there shall be respect had to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">3:7</span>. The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">3:8</span>. They shall judge nations, and rule over people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">3:9</span>. They that trust in him shall understand the truth:  and they that are faithful in love, shall rest in him:  for grace and peace are to his elect.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">3:10</span>. But the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices: who have neglected the just, and have revolted from the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">3:11</span>. For he that rejecteth wisdom, and discipline, is unhappy:  and their hope is vain, and their labours without fruit, and their works unprofitable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">3:12</span>. Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">3:13</span>. Their offspring is cursed, for happy is the barren:  and the undefiled, that hath not known bed in sin, she shall have fruit in the visitation of holy souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">3:14</span>. And the eunuch, that hath not wrought iniquity with his hands, nor thought wicked things against God for the precious gift of faith shall be given to him, and a most acceptable lot in the temple of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">3:15</span>. For the fruit of good labours is glorious, and the root of wisdom never faileth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">3:16</span>. But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, and the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">3:17</span>. And if they live long, they shall be nothing regarded, and their last old age shall be without honour.<br/>
<br/>

The difference between the chaste and the adulterous generations:  and between the death of the just and the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">4:1</span>. How beautiful is the chaste generation with glory:  for the memory thereof is immortal:  because it is known both with God and with men.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">4:2</span>. When it is present, they imitate it:  and they desire it, when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-70">4:3</span>. But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-71">4:4</span>. And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-72">4:5</span>. For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">4:6</span>. For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">4:7</span>. But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">4:8</span>. For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years:  but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">4:9</span>. And a spotless life is old age.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-77">4:10</span>. He pleased God, and was beloved, and living among sinners, he was translated.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-80">4:13</span>. Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-81">4:14</span>. For his soul pleased God:  therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities:  but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">4:15</span>. That the grace of God, and his mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-84">4:17</span>. For they shall see the end of the wise man, and it shall not understand what God hath designed for him, and why the Lord hath set him in safety.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-85">4:18</span>. They shall see him, and shall despise him:  but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-86">4:19</span>. And they shall fall after this without honour, and be a reproach among the dead for ever:  for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste:  they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.<br/>

The fruitless repentance of the wicked in another world:  the reward of the just.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-100">5:11</span>. Or as when a bird flieth through the air, of the passage of which no mark can be found, but only the sound of the wings beating the light air, and parting it by the force of her flight:  she moved her wings, and hath flown through, and there is no mark found afterwards of her way:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-101">5:12</span>. Or as when an arrow is shot at a mark, the divided air quickly cometh together again, so that the passage thereof is not known:<br/>

For the hope of the wicked is as dust, which is blown away with the wind, and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm:  and a smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind:  and as the remembrance of a guest of one day that passeth by.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-129">6:14</span>. She preventeth them that covet her, so that she first sheweth herself unto them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-130">6:15</span>. He that awaketh early to seek her, shall not labour:  for he shall find her sitting at his door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-131">6:16</span>. To think, therefore, upon her, is perfect understanding:  and he that watcheth for her, shall quickly be secure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-132">6:17</span>. For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, and she sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways, and meeteth them with all providence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-133">6:18</span>. For the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-134">6:19</span>. And the care of discipline is love:  and love is the keeping of her laws:  and the keeping of her laws is the firm foundation of incorruption:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-135">6:20</span>. And incorruption bringeth near to God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-136">6:21</span>. Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-137">6:22</span>. If then your delight be in thrones, and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, love wisdom, that you may reign for ever.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-138">6:23</span>. Love the light of wisdom, all ye that bear rule over peoples.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-139">6:24</span>. Now what wisdom is, and what was her origin, I will declare:  and I will not hide from you the mysteries of God, but will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring the knowledge of her to light, and will not pass over the truth:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-140">6:25</span>. Neither will I go with consuming envy:  for such a man shall not be partaker of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-141">6:26</span>. Now the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the whole world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-142">6:27</span>. Receive, therefore, instruction by my words, and it shall be profitable to you.</p>

<p><b>Wisdom Chapter 7<br id="bookmark-drb1752-144"/>
</b><br/>
The excellence of wisdom:  how she is to be found.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-145">7:1</span>. I myself am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-146">7:2</span>. In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-147">7:3</span>. And being born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-148">7:4</span>. I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-149">7:5</span>. For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-150">7:6</span>. For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-151">7:7</span>. Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me:  and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-152">7:8</span>. And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-153">7:9</span>. Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone:  for all gold, in comparison of her, is as a little sand; and silver, in respect to her, shall be counted as clay.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-154">7:10</span>. I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light:  for her light cannot be put out.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-155">7:11</span>. Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-156">7:12</span>. And I rejoiced in all these:  for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-157">7:13</span>. Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-158">7:14</span>. For she is an infinite treasure to men:  which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts of discipline.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-159">7:15</span>. And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me:  because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-160">7:16</span>. For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-161">7:17</span>. For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-162">7:18</span>. The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-163">7:19</span>. The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-164">7:20</span>. The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-165">7:21</span>. And all such things as are hid, and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-166">7:22</span>. For in her is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-167">7:23</span>. Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits:  intelligible, pure, subtile:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-168">7:24</span>. For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere, by reason of her purity.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-169">7:25</span>. For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emmanation of the glory of the Almighty God:  and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-170">7:26</span>. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-171">7:27</span>. And being but one, she can do all things:  and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-172">7:28</span>. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-173">7:29</span>. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars:  being compared with the light, she is found before it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-174">7:30</span>. For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-178">8:2</span>. Her have I loved, and have sought her out from my youth, and have desired to take for my spouse, and I became a lover of her beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-179">8:3</span>. She glorifieth her nobility by being conversant with God:  yea, and the Lord of all things hath loved her.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-180">8:4</span>. For it is she that teacheth the knowledge of God and is the chooser of his works.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-181">8:5</span>. And if riches be desired in life, what is richer than wisdom, which maketh all things?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-182">8:6</span>. And if sense do work:  who is a more artful worker than she of those things that are?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-183">8:7</span>. And if a man love justice:  her labours have great virtues:  for she teacheth temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-184">8:8</span>. And if a man desire much knowledge:  she knoweth things past, and judgeth of things to come:  she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and the solutions of arguments:  she knoweth signs and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-185">8:9</span>. I purposed, therefore, to take her to me to live with me:  knowing that she will communicate to me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my cares and grief.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-186">8:10</span>. For her sake I shall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the ancients, though I be young:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-187">8:11</span>. And I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of the mighty, and the faces of princes shall wonder at me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-188">8:12</span>. They shall wait for me when I hold my peace, and they shall look upon me when I speak; and if I talk much, they shall lay their hands on their mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-189">8:13</span>. Moreover, by the means of her I shall have immortality:  and shall leave behind me an everlasting memory to them that come after me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-190">8:14</span>. I shall set the people in order:  and nations shall be subject to me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-191">8:15</span>. Terrible kings hearing, shall be afraid of me:  among the multitude I shall be found good, and valiant in war.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-192">8:16</span>. When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her:  for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-193">8:17</span>. Thinking these things with myself, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wisdom is immortality,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-194">8:18</span>. And that there is great delight in her friendship, and inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands, and in the exercise of conference with her, wisdom, and glory in the communication of her words:  I went about seeking, that I might take her to myself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-195">8:19</span>. And I was a witty child, and had received a good soul.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-196">8:20</span>. And whereas I was more good, I came to a body undefiled.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">9:8</span>. And hast commanded me to build a temple on thy holy mount, and an altar in the city of thy dwelling place, a resemblance of thy holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">9:9</span>. And thy wisdom with thee, which knoweth thy works, which then also was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was agreeable to thy eyes, and what was right in thy commandments.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-370">15:15</span>. For they have esteemed all the idols of the heathens for gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle, and as for their feet, they are slow to walk.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-371">15:16</span>. For man made them:  and he that borroweth his own breath, fashioned them.  For no man can make a god like to himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-372">15:17</span>. For being mortal himself, he formeth a dead thing with his wicked hands.  For he is better than they whom he worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but they never.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-373">15:18</span>. Moreover, they worship also the vilest creatures:  but things without sense, compared to these, are worse than they.<br/>
<br/>

God's different dealings with the Egyptians and with his own people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-377">16:1</span>. For these things, and by the like things to these, they were worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-378">16:2</span>. Instead of which punishment, dealing well with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-379">16:3</span>. To the end, that they indeed desiring food, by means of those things that were shewn and sent among them, might loath even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire.  But these, after suffering want for a short time, tasted a new meat.<br/>
<br/>
They indeed desiring food, etc. . .He means the Egyptians; who were restrained even from that food which was necessary, by the frogs and the flies that were sent amongst them, and spoiled all their meats.--Ibid.  But these. . .Viz., the Israelites.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-380">16:4</span>. For it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon them that exercised tyranny:  but to these it should only be shewn how their enemies were destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-381">16:5</span>. For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these, they were destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-382">16:6</span>. But thy wrath endured not for ever, but they were troubled for a short time for their correction, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.<br/>
<br/>
Sign of salvation. . .The brazen serpent, an emblem of Christ our Saviour.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-383">16:7</span>. For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee, the Saviour of all.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-384">16:8</span>. And in this thou didst shew to our enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-385">16:9</span>. For the bitings of locusts, and of flies, killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life:  because they were worthy to be destroyed by such things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-386">16:10</span>. But not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy children:  for thy mercy came and healed them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-387">16:11</span>. For they were examined for the remembrance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-388">16:12</span>. For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaster, that healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-389">16:13</span>. For it is thou, O Lord, that hast power of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest back again:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-390">16:14</span>. A man indeed killeth through malice, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not return, neither shall he call back the soul that is received:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-391">16:15</span>. But it is impossible to escape thy hand:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-392">16:16</span>. For the wicked that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being persecuted by strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-393">16:17</span>. And which was wonderful, in water, which extinguisheth all things, the fire had more force:  for the world fighteth for the just.<br/>
<br/>
The fire had more force. . .Viz., when the fire and hail mingled together laid waste the land of Egypt.  Ex. 9.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-394">16:18</span>. For at one time the fire was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the wicked might not be burnt, but that they might see, and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-395">16:19</span>. And at another time the fire, above its own power, burnt in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a wicked land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-396">16:20</span>. Instead of which things, thou didst feed thy people with the food of angels, and gavest them bread from heaven, prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the sweetness of every taste.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-397">16:21</span>. For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children, and serving every man's will, it was turned to what every man liked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-398">16:22</span>. But snow and ice endured the force of fire, and melted not:  that they might know that the fire, burning in the hail, and flashing in the rain, destroyed the fruits of the enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-399">16:23</span>. But this same again, that the just might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-400">16:24</span>. For the creature serving thee, the Creator, is made fierce against the unjust for their punishment:  and abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-401">16:25</span>. Therefore even then it was transformed into all things, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all, according to the will of them that desired it of thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-402">16:26</span>. That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovedst, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men, but thy word preserveth them that believe in thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-403">16:27</span>. For that which could not be destroyed by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, presently melted away:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-404">16:28</span>. That it might be known to all, that we ought to prevent the sun to bless thee, and adore thee at the dawning of the light.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-405">16:29</span>. For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.<br/>

The Egyptian darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-408">17:1</span>. For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed:  therefore undisciplined souls have erred.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-409">17:2</span>. For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-410">17:3</span>. And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness, being horribly afraid, and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-411">17:4</span>. For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear:  for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-412">17:5</span>. And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-413">17:6</span>. But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful:  and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-414">17:7</span>. And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-415">17:8</span>. For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-416">17:9</span>. For though no terrible thing disturbed them:  yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-417">17:10</span>. For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation:  for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-418">17:11</span>. For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-419">17:12</span>. And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-420">17:13</span>. But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-421">17:14</span>. Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them:  for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-422">17:15</span>. Moreover, if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-423">17:16</span>. For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-424">17:17</span>. For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-425">17:18</span>. Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains:  these things made them to swoon for fear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-426">17:19</span>. For the whole world was enlightened, with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-427">17:20</span>. But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them.  But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.</p>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-430">18:1</span>. But thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape.  And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-431">18:2</span>. And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now:  and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-432">18:3</span>. Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a good entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
A harmless sun. . .A light that should not hurt or molest them; but that should be an agreeable guest to them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-433">18:4</span>. The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-434">18:5</span>. And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just:  one child being cast forth, and saved to reprove them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.<br/>
<br/>
One child. . .Viz., Moses.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-435">18:6</span>. For that night was known before by our fathers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they might be of better courage.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-436">18:7</span>. So thy people received the salvation of the just, and destruction of the unjust.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-437">18:8</span>. For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-438">18:9</span>. For the just children of good men were offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice:  that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.<br/>
<br/>
Of good men. . .Viz., of the patriarchs.  Their children, the Israelites, offered in private the sacrifice of the paschal lamb; and were regulating what they were to do in their journey, when that last and most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-439">18:10</span>. But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-440">18:11</span>. And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-441">18:12</span>. So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them:  for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
The noblest offspring. . .That is, the firstborn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-442">18:13</span>. For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-443">18:14</span>. For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-444">18:15</span>. Thy Almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction,<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-445">18:16</span>. With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth, reached even to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-446">18:17</span>. Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-447">18:18</span>. And one thrown here, another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-448">18:19</span>. For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish, and not know why they suffered these evils.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-449">18:20</span>. But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue;<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-450">18:21</span>. For a blameless man made haste to pry for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-451">18:22</span>. And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oath and covenant made with the fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-452">18:23</span>. For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-453">18:24</span>. For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world:  and in the four rows of the stones, the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-454">18:26</span>. And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.<br/>

Why God shewed no mercy to the Egyptians.  His favour to the Israelites. All creatures obey God's orders for the service of the good, and the punishment of the wicked.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-457">19:1</span>. But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy.  For he knew before also what they would do:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-458">19:2</span>. For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them away with great care, they repented and pursued after them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-459">19:3</span>. For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device:  and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-460">19:4</span>. For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end:  and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-461">19:5</span>. And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-462">19:6</span>. For every creature, according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-463">19:7</span>. For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance, and out of the great deep a springing field:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-464">19:8</span>. Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-465">19:9</span>. For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-466">19:10</span>. For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-467">19:11</span>. And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite, they asked for delicate meats.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-468">19:12</span>. For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea:  and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders:  for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-469">19:13</span>. For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-470">19:14</span>. And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-471">19:15</span>. But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with joy, and who lived under the same laws.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-472">19:16</span>. But they were struck with blindness:  as those others were at the doors of the just man, when they were covered with sudden darkness, and every one sought the passage of his own door.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-473">19:17</span>. For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their sound:  which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.<br/>
<br/>
Elements are changed, etc. . .The meaning is, that whatever changes God wrought in the elements by miracles in favour of his people, they still kept their harmony by obeying his will.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-474">19:18</span>. For the things of the land were turned into things of the water: and the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-475">19:19</span>. The fire had power in water above its own virtue, and the water forgot its quenching nature.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-476">19:20</span>. On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice.  For in all things thou didst magnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst not despise them, but didst assist them at all times, and in every place.<br/>
<br/>
That good food. . .The manna.</p>
