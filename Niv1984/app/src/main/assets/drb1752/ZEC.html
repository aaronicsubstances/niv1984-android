<p>THE PROPHECY OF ZACHARIAS<br id="bookmark-drb1752-1"/>
<br/>
ZACHARIAS began to prophesy in the same year as Aggeus, and upon the same occasion.  His prophecy is full of mysterious figures and promises of blessings, partly relating to the synagogue, and partly to the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Zacharias Chapter 1<br/>
</b><br/>
The prophet exhorts the people to return to God, and declares his visions, by which he puts them in hopes of better times.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-2">1:1</span>. In the eighth month, in the second year of king Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-3">1:2</span>. The Lord hath been exceeding angry with your fathers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-4">1:3</span>. And thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts:  and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-5">1:4</span>. Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  Turn ye from your evil ways, and from your wicked thoughts:  but they did not give ear, neither did they hearken to me, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-6">1:5</span>. Your fathers, where are they?  and the prophets, shall they live always?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-7">1:6</span>. But yet my words, and my ordinances, which I gave in charge to my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers, and they returned, and said:  As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so he hath done to us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-8">1:7</span>. In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-9">1:8</span>. I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottom:  and behind him were horses, red, speckled, and white.<br/>
<br/>
A man. . .An angel in the shape of a man.  It was probably Michael, the guardian angel of the church of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-10">1:9</span>. And I said:  What are these, my Lord?  and the angel that spoke in me, said to me:  I will shew thee what these are:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-11">1:10</span>. And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered, and said: These are they, whom the Lord hath sent to walk through the earth.<br/>
<br/>
These are they, etc. . .The guardian angels of provinces and nations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-12">1:11</span>. And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among the myrtle trees, and said:  We have walked through the earth, and behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-13">1:12</span>. And the angel of the Lord answered, and said:  O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry?  this is now the seventieth year.<br/>
<br/>
The seventieth year. . .Viz., from the beginning of the seige of Jerusalem, in the ninth year of king Sedecias, to the second year of king Darius.  These seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and the cities of Juda, are different from the seventy years of captivity foretold by Jeremias; which began in the fourth year of Joakim, and ended in the first year of king Cyrus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-14">1:13</span>. And the Lord answered the angel, that spoke in me, good words, comfortable words.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-15">1:14</span>. And the angel that spoke in me, said to me:  Cry thou, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  I am zealous for Jerusalem, and Sion with a great zeal.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-16">1:15</span>. And I am angry with a great anger with the wealthy nations:  for I was angry a little, but they helped forward the evil.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-17">1:16</span>. Therefore thus saith the Lord:  I will return to Jerusalem in mercies:  my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts:  and the building line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-18">1:17</span>. Cry yet, saying:  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  My cities shall yet flow with good things:  and the Lord will yet comfort Sion, and he will yet choose Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-19">1:18</span>. And I lifted up my eyes, and saw:  and behold four horns.<br/>
<br/>
Four horns. . .The four horns represent the empires, or kingdoms, that persecute and oppress the kingdom of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-20">1:19</span>. And I said to the angel that spoke in me:  What are these?  And he said to me:  These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-21">1:20</span>. And the Lord shewed me four smiths.<br/>
<br/>
Four smiths. . .The four smiths, or carpenters ( for faber may signify either) represent those whom God makes his instruments in bringing to nothing the power of persecutors.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-22">1:21</span>. And I said:  What come these to do?  and he spoke, saying:  These are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of them lifted up his head:  and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the nations, that have lifted up the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it.<br/>

<p><b>Zacharias Chapter 2<br id="bookmark-drb1752-24"/>
</b><br/>
Under the name of Jerusalem, he prophesieth the progress of the church of Christ, by the conversion of some Jews and many Gentiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-25">2:1</span>. And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, with a measuring line in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-26">2:2</span>. And I said:  Whither goest thou?  and he said to me:  To measure Jerusalem, and to see how great is the breadth thereof, and how great the length thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-27">2:3</span>. And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-28">2:4</span>. And he said to him:  Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls, by reason of the multitude of men, and of the beasts in the midst thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls. . .This must be understood of the spiritual Jerusalem, the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-29">2:5</span>. And I will be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-30">2:6</span>. O, O flee ye out of the land of the north, saith the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-31">2:7</span>. O Sion, flee, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-32">2:8</span>. For thus saith the Lord of hosts:  After the glory he hath sent me to the nations that have robbed you:  for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of my eye:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-33">2:9</span>. For behold, I lift up my hand upon them, and they shall be a prey to those that served them:  and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-34">2:10</span>. Sing praise, and rejoice, O daughter of Sion:  for behold I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee:  saith the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-35">2:11</span>. And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee:  and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-36">2:12</span>. And the Lord shall possess Juda his portion in the sanctified land:  and he shall yet choose Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-37">2:13</span>. Let all flesh be silent at the presence of the Lord:  for he is risen up out of his holy habitation.<br/>

<p><b>Zacharias Chapter 3<br id="bookmark-drb1752-39"/>
</b><br/>
In a vision Satan appeareth accusing the high priest.  He is cleansed from his sins.  Christ is promised, and great fruit from his passion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-40">3:1</span>. And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord:  and Satan stood on his right hand to be his adversary.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus. . .Alias, Josue, the son of Josedec, the high priest of that time.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-41">3:2</span>. And the Lord said to Satan:  The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan:  and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee:  Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-42">3:3</span>. And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments:  and he stood before the face of the angel.<br/>
<br/>
With filthy garments. . .Negligences and sins.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-43">3:4</span>. Who answered, and said to them that stood before him, saying:  Take away the filthy garments from him.  And he said to him:  Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with change of garments.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-44">3:5</span>. And he said:  Put a clean mitre upon his head:  and they put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-45">3:6</span>. And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-46">3:7</span>. Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to walk with thee.<br/>
<br/>
I will give thee, etc. . .Angels to attend and assist thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-47">3:8</span>. Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, thou and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they are portending men:  for behold, I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.<br/>
<br/>
Portending men. . .That is, men, who by words and actions are to foreshew wonders that are to come.--Ibid.  My servant the Orient. . .Christ, who according to his humanity is the servant of God, is called the Orient from his rising like the sun in the east to enlighten the world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-48">3:9</span>. For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus:  upon one stone there are seven eyes:  behold I will grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts:  and I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.<br/>
<br/>
The stone. . .Another emblem of Christ, the rock, foundation, and corner stone of his church.--Ibid.  Seven eyes. . .The manifold providence of Christ over his church, or the seven gifts of the spirit of God.--Ibid. One day. . .Viz., the day of the passion of Christ, the source of all our good:  when this precious stone shall be graved, that is, cut and pierced, with whips, thorns, nails, and spear.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-49">3:10</span>. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shall call his friend under the vine and under the fig tree.<br/>

The vision of the golden candlestick and seven lamps, and of the two olive trees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-52">4:1</span>. And the angel that spoke in me came again:  and he waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-53">4:2</span>. And he said to me:  What seest thou?  And I said:  I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it:  and seven funnels for the lights that were upon the top thereof.<br/>
<br/>
A candlestick, etc. . .The temple of God that was then in building; and in a more sublime sense, the church of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-54">4:3</span>. And two olive trees over it:  one upon the right side of the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-55">4:4</span>. And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying: What are these things, my lord?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-56">4:5</span>. And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me:  Knowest thou not what these things are?  And I said:  No, my lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-57">4:6</span>. And he answered, and spoke to me, saying:  This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying:  Not with an army, nor by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.<br/>
<br/>
To Zorobabel. . .This vision was in favour of Zorobabel:  to assure him of success in the building of the temple, which he had begun, signified by the candlestick; the lamp of which, without any other industry, was supplied with oil, dropping from the two olive trees, and distributed by the seven funnels or pipes, to maintain the seven lights.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-58">4:7</span>. Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel?  thou shalt become a plain:  and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Great mountain. . .So he calls the opposition made by the enemies of God's people; which nevertheless, without an army or might on their side, was quashed by divine providence.--Ibid.  Shall give equal grace, etc. . .Shall add grace to grace, or beauty to beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-59">4:8</span>. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-60">4:9</span>. The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house, and his hands shall finish it:  and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-61">4:10</span>. For who hath despised little days?  and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel.  These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.<br/>
<br/>
Little days. . .That is, these small and feeble beginnings of the temple of God.--Ibid.  The tin plummet. . .Literally, the stone of tin.  He means the builder's plummet, which Zorobabel shall hold in his hand for the finishing the building.--Ibid.  The seven eyes. . .The providence of God, that oversees and orders all things.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-62">4:11</span>. And I answered, and said to him:  What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof ?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-63">4:12</span>. And I answered again, and said to him:  What are the two olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels of gold?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-64">4:13</span>. And he spoke to me, saying:  Knowest thou not what these are?  And I said:  No, my lord.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-65">4:14</span>. And he said:  These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord of the whole earth.<br/>

Two sons of oil. . .That is, the two anointed ones of the Lord; viz., Jesus the high priest, and Zorobabel the prince.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-68">5:1</span>. And I turned and lifted up my eyes:  and I saw, and behold a volume flying.<br/>
<br/>
A volume. . .That is, a parchment, according to the form of the ancient books, which, from being rolled up, were called volumes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-69">5:2</span>. And he said to me:  What seest thou?  And I said:  I see a volume flying:  the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-73">5:6</span>. And I said:  What is it?  And he said:  This is a vessel going forth.  And he said:  This is their eye in all the earth.<br/>
<br/>
This is their eye. . .This is what they fix their eye upon:  or this is a resemblance and figure of them, viz., of sinners.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-74">5:7</span>. And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-75">5:8</span>. And he said:  This is wickedness.  And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-76">5:9</span>. And I lifted up my eyes and looked:  and behold there came out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite:  and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.<br/>

<br/>
The land of Sennaar. . .Where Babel or Babylon was built, Gen. 11., where note, that Babylon in holy writ is often taken for the city of the devil:  that is, for the whole congregation of the wicked:  as Jerusalem is taken for the city and people of God.<br/>

<br/>
Four chariots. . .The four great empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Grecians, and Romans.  Or perhaps by the fourth chariot are represented the kings of Egypt and of Asia, the descendants of Ptolemeus and Seleucus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-82">6:2</span>. In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses.<br/>

The land of the north. . .So Babylon is called; because it lay to the north in respect of Jerusalem.  The black horses, that is, the Medes and Persians:  and after them Alexander and his Greeks, signified by the white horses, went thither because they conquered Babylon, executed upon it the judgments of God, which is signified, ver. 8, by the expression of quieting his spirit.--Ibid.

Between them both. . .That is, he shall unite in himself the two offices or dignities of king and priest.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-94">6:14</span>. And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias, and to Hem, the son of Sophonias, a memorial in the temple of the Lord.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-199">12:9</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-200">12:10</span>. And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of prayers:  and they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced:  and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-201">12:11</span>. In that day there shall be a great lamentation in Jerusalem like the lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of Mageddon.<br/>
<br/>
Adadremmon. . .A place near Mageddon, where the good king Josias was slain, and much lamented by his people.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-202">12:12</span>. And the land shall mourn:  families and families apart:  the families of the house of David apart, and their women apart:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-203">12:13</span>. The families of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart:  the families of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart: the families of Semei apart, and their women apart.<br/>

The fountain of Christ.  Idols and false prophets shall be extirpated: Christ shall suffer:  his people shall be tried by fire.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-207">13:1</span>. In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:  for the washing of the sinner, and of the unclean woman.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-208">13:2</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will destroy the names of idols out of the earth, and they shall be remembered no more:  and I will take away the false prophets, and the unclean spirit out of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-209">13:3</span>. And it shall come to pass, that when any man shall prophesy any more, his father and his mother that brought him into the world, shall say to him:  Thou shalt not live:  because thou hast spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.  And his father, and his mother, his parents, shall thrust him through, when he shall prophesy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-210">13:4</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be confounded, every one by his own vision, when he shall prophesy, neither shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth, to deceive:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-211">13:5</span>. But he shall say:  I am no prophet, I am a husbandman:  for Adam is my example from my youth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-212">13:6</span>. And they shall say to him:  What are these wounds in the midst of thy hands?  And he shall say:  With these I was wounded in the house of them that loved me.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-213">13:7</span>. Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that cleaveth to me, saith the Lord of hosts:  strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:  and I will turn my hand to the little ones.<br/>

<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-214">13:8</span>. And there shall be in all the earth, saith the Lord, two parts in it shall be scattered, and shall perish:  but the third part shall be left therein.<br/>

<p><b>Zacharias Chapter 14<br id="bookmark-drb1752-217"/>
</b><br/>
After the persecutions of the church shall follow great prosperity. Persecutors shall be punished:  so shall all that will not serve God in his church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-218">14:1</span>. Behold the days of the Lord shall come, and thy spoils shall be divided in the midst of thee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-219">14:2</span>. And I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be rifled, and the women shall be defiled:  and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city.<br/>
<br/>
I will gather, etc. . .This seems to be a prophecy of what was done by Antiochus.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-220">14:3</span>. Then the Lord shall go forth, and shall fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-221">14:4</span>. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is over against Jerusalem towards the east:  and the mount of Olives shall be divided in the midst thereof to the east, and to the west with a very great opening, and half of the mountain shall be separated to the north, and half thereof to the south.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-222">14:5</span>. And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and you shall flee as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Ozias king of Juda:  and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-223">14:6</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall be no light, but cold and frost.<br/>
<br/>
No light. . .Viz., in that dismal time of persecution of Antiochus, when it was neither day nor night:  (ver. 7) because they neither had the comfortable light of the day, nor the repose of the night.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-224">14:7</span>. And there shall be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day nor night:  and in the time of the evening there shall be light:<br/>
<br/>
In the time of the evening there shall be light. . .An unexpected light shall arise by the means of the Machabees, when things shall seem to be at the worst.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-225">14:8</span>. And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem:  half of them to the east sea, and half of them to the last sea:  they shall be in summer and in winter.<br/>
<br/>
Living waters. . .Viz., the gospel of Christ.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-226">14:9</span>. And the Lord shall be king over all the earth:  in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-227">14:10</span>. And all the land shall return even to the desert, from the hill to Remmon to the south of Jerusalem:  and she shall be exalted, and shall dwell in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners:  and from the tower of Hananeel even to the king's winepresses.<br/>
<br/>
All the land shall return, etc. . .This, in some measure, was verified by the means of the Machabees:  but is rather to be taken in a spiritual sense, as relating to the propagation of the church, and kingdom of Christ, the true Jerusalem, which alone shall never fall under the anathema of destruction, or God's curse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-228">14:11</span>. And people shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more an anathema:  but Jerusalem shall sit secure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-229">14:12</span>. And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord shall strike all nations that have fought against Jerusalem:  the flesh of every one shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.<br/>
<br/>
The flesh of every one shall consume, etc. . .Such judgments as these have often fallen upon the persecutors of God's church, as appears by many instances in history.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-230">14:13</span>. In that day there shall be a great tumult from the Lord among them:  and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped upon his neighbour's hand.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-231">14:14</span>. And even Juda shall fight against Jerusalem:  and the riches of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and garments in great abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Even Juda, etc. . .The carnal Jews, and other false brothers, shall join in persecuting the church.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-232">14:15</span>. And the destruction of the horse, and of the mule, and of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts, that shall be in those tents, shall be like this destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Shall be like this destruction. . .That is, the beasts shall be destroyed as well as the men:  the common soldiers as well as their leaders.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-233">14:16</span>. And all they that shall be left of all nations that came against Jerusalem, shall go up from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
They that shall be left, etc. . .That is, many of them that persecuted the church shall be converted to its faith and communion.--Ibid.  To keep the feast of tabernacles. . .This feast was kept by the Jews in memory of their sojourning forty years in the desert, in their way to the land of promise.  And in the spiritual sense is duly kept by all such Christians as in their earthly pilgrimage are continually advancing toward their true home, the heavenly Jerusalem; by the help of the sacraments and sacrifice of the church.  And they that neglect this must not look for the kind showers of divine grace, to give fruitfulness to their souls.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-234">14:17</span>. And it shall come to pass, that he that shall not go up of the families of the land to Jerusalem, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there shall be no rain upon them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-235">14:18</span>. And if the family of Egypt go not up nor come:  neither shall it be upon them, but there shall be destruction wherewith the Lord will strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-236">14:19</span>. This shall be the sin of Egypt, and this the sin of all nations, that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-237">14:20</span>. In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be holy to the Lord:  and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as the phials before the altar.<br/>
<br/>
That which is upon the bridle, etc. . .The golden ornaments of the bridles, etc., shall be turned into offerings in the house of God.  And there shall be an abundance of caldrons and phials for the sacrifices of the temple; by which is meant, under a figure, the great resort there shall be to the temple, that is, to the church of Christ, and her sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vnum" id="bookmark-drb1752-238">14:21</span>. And every caldron in Jerusalem and Juda shall be sanctified to the Lord of hosts:  and all that sacrifice shall come, and take of them, and shall seethe in them:  and the merchant shall be no more in the house of the Lord of hosts in that day.<br/>
<br/>
The merchant shall be no more, etc. . .Or, as some render it, The Chanaanite shall be no more, etc., that is, the profane and unbelievers shall have no title to be in the house of the Lord.  Or there shall be no occasion for buyers or sellers of oxen, or sheep, or doves, in the house of God, such as Jesus Christ cast out of the temple.<br/>
