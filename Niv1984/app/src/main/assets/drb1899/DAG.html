<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim the king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king spoke to Asphenez the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed and of the princes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in knowledge, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king’s palace, that he might teach them the learning, and tongue of the Chaldeans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now there was among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the master of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king’s table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel: I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king’s meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king’s meat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And to these children God gave knowledge, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding also of all visions and dreams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the diviners, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-25-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor had a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of his mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-26-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-27-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-28-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-29-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king answering said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-30-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-31-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-32-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The king answered, and said: I know for certain that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-33-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If therefore you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and full of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away.

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-34-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king, neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-35-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-36-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-37-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-38-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch the general of the king’s army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-39-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-40-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Daniel went in and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias his companions:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-43-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-44-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And speaking he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-45-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them, giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-46-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-47-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us, the king’s discourse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-48-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-49-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-50-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-51-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers can declare to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-52-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-53-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-54-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-55-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-56-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-57-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-58-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-59-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer’s thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-60-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-61-2-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-66-2-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-68-2-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people, and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-69-2-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces, the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-70-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.</span></div>
