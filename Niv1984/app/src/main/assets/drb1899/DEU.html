<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Cadesbarne.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab. And Moses began to expound the law, and to say:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have stayed long enough in this mountain:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I said to you at that time:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I alone am not able to bear you: for the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for multitude.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then you answered me: The thing is good which thou meanest to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that which is just: whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And I commanded you all things that you were to do.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I said to you: You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one of every tribe:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought them to us, and said: The land is good, which the Lord our God will give us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>You murmured in your tents, and said: The Lord hateth us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry and swore, and said:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil, they shall go in: and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And you answered me: We have sinned against the Lord: we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded. And when you went ready armed unto the mountain,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.</span></div>
