<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king’s magnificence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But she refused, and would not come at the king’s commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians, and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king’s indignation is just.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remem-bered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king’s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king’s women: and let them receive women’s ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And whosoever among them all shall please the king’s eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-30-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he had brought up his brother’s daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when the king’s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women’s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king’s house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Esther’s welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king’s chamber.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king’s concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther. And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-44-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king’s gate,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-45-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king’s gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai’s name, who had reported the thing unto her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-51-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-52-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And all the king’s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-53-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king’s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king’s commandment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-54-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-55-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-56-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-57-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-58-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-59-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-60-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-61-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-62-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-63-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Were sent by the king’s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-64-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-69-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king’s court.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-79-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when Mardochai had heard this,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-80-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king’s house, more than all the Jews:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-82-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</span></div>
