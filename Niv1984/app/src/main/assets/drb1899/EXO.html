<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied, and increased:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the child’s sister said to her: Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?</span></div>
