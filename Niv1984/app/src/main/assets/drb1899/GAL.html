<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they glorified God in me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-28-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-29-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-30-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-31-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-32-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-33-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-34-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-35-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-36-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-37-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-38-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-39-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-40-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-43-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-44-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-45-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-46-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-47-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-48-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-57-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-58-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-59-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-60-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-66-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-67-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-68-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-69-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-70-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-71-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-72-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</span></div>
