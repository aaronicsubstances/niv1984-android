<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also. Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-44-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-45-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-53-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-54-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</span></div>
