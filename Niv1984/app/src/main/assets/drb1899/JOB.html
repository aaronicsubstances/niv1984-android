<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them.

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now when Job’s three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite.
