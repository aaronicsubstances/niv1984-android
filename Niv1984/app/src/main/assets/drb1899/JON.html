<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Arise, and go to Ninive the great city, and preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the Lord sent a great wind into the sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us, that we may not perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And they said to him: What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he said to them: Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the men rowed hard to return to land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-22-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-23-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And thou hast cast me forth into the deep in the heart of the sea, and a flood hast compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-24-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see thy holy temple again.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-26-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-27-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-36-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Jonas began to enter into the city one day’s journey: and he cried, and said: Yet forty days, and Ninive shall be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-37-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-39-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive from the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen nor sheep, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-47-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.</span></div>
