<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord’s ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus fadeth away.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and Iwill burst thy bonds asunder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off.</span></div>
