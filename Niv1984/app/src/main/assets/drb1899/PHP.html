<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-41-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='drb1899-bookmark-42-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:</span></div>
