Instead he was forced to flee once again to the territory of the Ammonites, and in the end his evil plot brought him nothing but shame and disgrace,</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-8" id="en-GNT-13761"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>and he died in misery. Aretas, the ruler of the Arabs, imprisoned him; he was looked upon as a criminal and despised because he had betrayed his own people; everyone was hunting for him, and he had to run from town to town. He fled to Egypt for safety,</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-9" id="en-GNT-13762"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>then to Greece, hoping to find refuge among the Spartans, who were related to the Jews. Finally, this man, who had forced so many others to flee from their own country, died as a fugitive in a foreign land.</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-10" id="en-GNT-13763"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Jason had killed many people and left their bodies unburied, but now his own death was unmourned.

Such was his arrogance that he felt he could make ships sail across dry land or troops march across the sea.</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-22" id="en-GNT-13775"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>He appointed governors to cause trouble for the people.

In addition to these, there was Menelaus, who mistreated his fellow Jews far worse than the governors did. Antiochus hated the Jews so much</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-24" id="en-GNT-13777"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>that he sent an army of 22,000 mercenary troops from Mysia to Jerusalem under the command of a man named Apollonius, with orders to kill every man in the city and to sell the women and boys as slaves.</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-25" id="en-GNT-13778"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Apollonius arrived in Jerusalem, pretending to be on a peace mission. Then on a Sabbath, when all the Jews were observing the day of rest, he led his troops, who were fully armed, in a parade outside the city.</span> <span class="text 2Macc-5-26" id="en-GNT-13779"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Suddenly he commanded his men to kill everyone who had come out to see them.
