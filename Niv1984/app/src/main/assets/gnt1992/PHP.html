How happy you make me, and how proud I am of you!—this, dear friends, is how you should stand firm in your life in the Lord.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-4-2" id="en-GNT-32470"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Euodia and Syntyche, please, I beg you, try to agree as sisters in the Lord. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-3" id="en-GNT-32471"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>And you too, my faithful partner, I want you to help these women; for they have worked hard with me to spread the gospel, together with Clement and all my other fellow workers, whose names are in God's book of the living.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-4-4" id="en-GNT-32472"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>May you always be joyful in your union with the Lord. I say it again: rejoice!</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-4-5" id="en-GNT-32473"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Show a gentle attitude toward everyone. The Lord is coming soon. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-6" id="en-GNT-32474"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Don't worry about anything, but in all your prayers ask God for what you need, always asking him with a thankful heart. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-7" id="en-GNT-32475"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And God's peace, which is far beyond human understanding, will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class="text Phil-4-8" id="en-GNT-32476"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>In conclusion, my friends, fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise: things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, and honorable. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-9" id="en-GNT-32477"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Put into practice what you learned and received from me, both from my words and from my actions.

I have all I need now that Epaphroditus has brought me all your gifts. They are like a sweet-smelling offering to God, a sacrifice which is acceptable and pleasing to him. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-19" id="en-GNT-32487"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And with all his abundant wealth through Christ Jesus, my God will supply all your needs. </span> <span class="text Phil-4-20" id="en-GNT-32488"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!
