<h3><span class="text Sir-1-1" id="en-GNT-19314">Foreword</span></h3><p><span class="text Sir-1-1">The Law, the Prophets, and the later writers have left us a wealth of valuable teachings, and we should praise Israel for the instruction and wisdom they provide. But it is not enough that those who read them should gain understanding for themselves. Anyone who values learning should be able to help others by what he himself says and writes. That is why my grandfather Jesus devoted himself to reading the Law, the Prophets, and the other books of our ancestors. After he had mastered them, he was led to write a book of his own in order to share his wisdom and learning with others, so that anyone who shared his love for learning should have his book available as well, and be all the more able to live according to the Law.</span></p><p><span class="text Sir-1-1">Let me urge you, then, to read this book carefully and with an open mind. And please be patient in those places where, in spite of all my diligent efforts, I may not have translated some phrases vry well. What was originally written in Hebrew does not always have exactly the same sense when it is translated into another language.<sup class="footnote" data-fn="#fen-GNT-19314a" data-link='[&lt;a href="#fen-GNT-19314a" title="See footnote a"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href="#fen-GNT-19314a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> That is true not only of this book, but even of the Law itself, the Prophets, and the other books. The translations differ quite a bit from the original.</span></p><p><span class="text Sir-1-1">I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of King Euergetes' reign and stayed for some time. While I was there, I had the opportunity for a good deal of study and felt the necessity of translating the following book. I wanted to use all my diligence and skill to complete it and make it available for all those living in foreign lands who wish to learn and who have the strength of character to live by the Law of Moses.</span></p><h2 id="bookmark-gnt1992-1">Chapter 1</h2><h3><span class="text Sir-1-1">In Praise of Wisdom</span></h3><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="chapter-1"><span class="text Sir-1-1"><sup class="crossreference" data-cr="#cen-GNT-19314A" data-link='(&lt;a href="#cen-GNT-19314A" title="See cross-reference A"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;)'>(<a href="#cen-GNT-19314A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup>All wisdom comes from the Lord,</span></span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Sir-1-1">and Wisdom is with him forever.</span></span><br/><span class="text Sir-1-2" id="en-GNT-19315"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>Who can count raindrops or the sand along the shore?</span><br/><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span><span class="text Sir-1-2">Who can count the days of eternity?</span></span><br/><span class="text Sir-1-3" id="en-GNT-19316"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>How high is the sky?
