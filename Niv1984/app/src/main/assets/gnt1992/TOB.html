<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Tob-1-1" id="en-GNT-11954">I am Tobit and this is the story of my life. My father was Tobiel, my grandfather was Ananiel, and my great-grandfather was Aduel. Aduel's father was Gabael; his grandfather was Raphael; and his great-grandfather was Raguel, who belonged to the clan of Asiel, a part of the tribe of Naphtali.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-2" id="en-GNT-11955"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup><sup class="crossreference" data-cr="#cen-GNT-11955A" data-link='(&lt;a href="#cen-GNT-11955A" title="See cross-reference A"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;)'>(<a href="#cen-GNT-11955A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup>During the time that Shalmaneser was emperor of Assyria, I was taken captive in my hometown of Thisbe, located in northern Galilee, south of Kadesh in Naphtali, northwest of Hazor, and north of Phogor.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Tob-1-3" id="en-GNT-11956">Tobit's Early Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Tob-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>All my life I have been honest and have tried to do what was right. I often gave money to help needy relatives and other Jews who had been deported with me to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria.</span></p> <p><span class="text Tob-1-4" id="en-GNT-11957"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>When I was young, I lived in northern Israel. All the tribes in Israel were supposed to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem. It was the one city that God had chosen from among all the Israelite cities as the place where his Temple was to be built for his holy and eternal home. But my entire tribe of Naphtali rejected the city of Jerusalem and the kings descended from David.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-5" id="en-GNT-11958"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup><sup class="crossreference" data-cr="#cen-GNT-11958B" data-link='(&lt;a href="#cen-GNT-11958B" title="See cross-reference B"&gt;B&lt;/a&gt;)'>(<a href="#cen-GNT-11958B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup>Like everyone else in this tribe, my own family used to go to the city of Dan in the mountains of northern Galilee to offer sacrifices to the gold bull-calf which King Jeroboam of Israel had set up there.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Tob-1-6" id="en-GNT-11959">Tobit's Faithfulness to His Religion</span></h3><p><span class="text Tob-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup><sup class="crossreference" data-cr="#cen-GNT-11959C" data-link='(&lt;a href="#cen-GNT-11959C" title="See cross-reference C"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;)'>(<a href="#cen-GNT-11959C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup>I was the only one in my family who regularly went to Jerusalem to celebrate the religious festivals, as the Law of Moses commands everyone to do. I would hurry off to Jerusalem with the first part of my harvest, the first-born of my animals, a tenth of my cattle, and the freshly clipped wool from my sheep. Then I would stand before the altar in the Temple, and give these offerings to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-7" id="en-GNT-11960"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I would give a tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruits to the Levites who served God in Jerusalem.

I did this in keeping with the Law of Moses, which Deborah, the mother of my grandfather Ananiel, had taught me to obey.

We had a son and named him Tobias.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-10" id="en-GNT-11963"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Later, I was taken captive and deported to Assyria, and that is how I came to live in Nineveh.</span></p><p><span class="text Tob-1-10">While we lived in Nineveh, all my relatives and the other Jews used to eat the same kind of food as the other people who lived there,</span> <span class="text Tob-1-11" id="en-GNT-11964"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>but I refused to do so.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-12" id="en-GNT-11965"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Since I took seriously the commands of the Most High God,</span> <span class="text Tob-1-13" id="en-GNT-11966"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>he made Emperor Shalmaneser respect me, and I was placed in charge of purchasing all the emperor's supplies.</span></p> <p><span class="text Tob-1-14" id="en-GNT-11967"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Before the emperor died, I made regular trips to the land of Media to buy things for him there. Once, when I was in the city of Rages in Media, I left some bags of money there with Gabael, Gabrias' brother, and asked him to keep them for me. There were more than 600 pounds of silver coins in those bags.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-15" id="en-GNT-11968"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When Shalmaneser died, his son Sennacherib succeeded him as emperor. It soon became so dangerous to travel on the roads in Media that I could no longer go there.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Tob-1-16" id="en-GNT-11969">Tobit Buries the Dead</span></h3><p><span class="text Tob-1-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>While Shalmaneser was still emperor, I took good care of my own people whenever they were in need.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-17" id="en-GNT-11970"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup><sup class="crossreference" data-cr="#cen-GNT-11970D" data-link='(&lt;a href="#cen-GNT-11970D" title="See cross-reference D"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;)'>(<a href="#cen-GNT-11970D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup>If they were hungry, I shared my food with them; if they needed clothes, I gave them some of my own. Whenever I saw that the dead body of one of my people had been thrown outside the city wall, I gave it a decent burial.</span></p> <p><span class="text Tob-1-18" id="en-GNT-11971"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>One day Sennacherib cursed God, the King of Heaven; God punished him, and Sennacherib had to retreat from Judah. On his way back to Media he was so furious that he killed many Israelites. But I secretly removed the bodies and buried them; and when Sennacherib later searched for the bodies, he could not find them.</span></p> <p><span class="text Tob-1-19" id="en-GNT-11972"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then someone from Nineveh told the emperor that I was the one who had been burying his victims. As soon as I realized that the emperor knew all about me and that my life was in danger, I became frightened. So I ran away and hid.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-20" id="en-GNT-11973"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Everything I owned was seized and put in the royal treasury. My wife Anna and my son Tobias were all I had left.</span></p> <h3><span class="text Tob-1-21" id="en-GNT-11974">Tobit's Nephew Rescues Him</span></h3><p><span class="text Tob-1-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>About six weeks later, two of Sennacherib's sons assassinated him and then escaped to the mountains of Ararat. Another son, Esarhaddon, became emperor and put Ahikar, my brother Anael's son, in charge of all the financial affairs of the empire.</span> <span class="text Tob-1-22" id="en-GNT-11975"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>This was actually the second time Ahikar was appointed to this position, for when Sennacherib was emperor of Assyria, Ahikar had been wine steward, treasurer, and accountant, and had been in charge of the official seal. Since Ahikar was my nephew, he put in a good word for me with the emperor, and I was allowed to return to Nineveh.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

It will all come true, every word of it, when the right time comes. I am absolutely convinced that everything God has said is sure to come true. God does not break his promises. It will be safer for you in Media than in Assyria or Babylon.</span></p></div><p><span class="text Tob-14-4">Those Jews who live in Israel will all be scattered and taken from that good land into exile.

They will rebuild God's Temple in Jerusalem, just as Israel's prophets have foretold.</span></p> <p><span class="text Tob-14-6" id="en-GNT-12180"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then all the nations in the world will come back to God.

Do not stay here. As soon as you bury your mother beside me, leave; do not stay another night within the city limits. It is a wicked city and full of immorality; the people here have no sense of shame. Remember what Nadab did to Ahikar his own uncle who had brought him up. He tried to kill Ahikar and forced him to go into hiding in a tomb. Ahikar came back into the light of day, but God sent Nadab down into everlasting darkness for what he had done.
