<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>O Lord, for thy servant’s sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass after this, that David defeated the Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out of the hands of the Philistines,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David’s servants, and brought him gifts.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the Syrians of Damascus came also to help Adarezer king of Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He sent Adoram his son to king David, to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And all the vessels of gold, and silver, and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Susa, scribe.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to return.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Soba.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of valiant men:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city: and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will help thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord will do that which is good in his sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the Syrians to the battle: and he put them to flight.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him: and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon: and he returned with all his people to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the king’s word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king’s orders.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Either three years’ famine: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father’s house: and let not thy people be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king rising up, and standing said: Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had a thought to have built a house, in which the ark of the Lord, and the footstool of our God might rest: and I prepared all things for the building.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father’s house: and among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And among my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And king David said to all the assembly: Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender: and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for man, but for God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house of my God. Gold for vessels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble of Paros in great abundance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king’s possessions promised,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of silver ten thousand talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And all they that had stones, gave them to the treasures of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the Gersonite.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings willingly: because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he blessed the Lord before all the multitude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eternity.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy glorious name.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise thee all these things? all things are thine: and we have given thee what we received of thy hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our fathers. Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and all things are thine.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always for the worship of thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, and Sadoc to be high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.</span></div>
