<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But to us God hath revealed them, by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></div>
