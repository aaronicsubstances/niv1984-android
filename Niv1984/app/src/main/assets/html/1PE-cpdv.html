<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> This letter is to the Christians who were formerly Jews, especially those living away from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The Greek word ‘kairos’ is translated here as ‘tempus.’ In Greek ‘chronos’ refers to time as in the time of day or a length of time; but kairos is used for the more abstract idea of opportunity or conditions or timing, as in the English expression ‘the right time.’ So the translation here is not that the Prophets were seeking to know the date of the arrival of Christ, but rather what condition and circumstances would bring the Messiah. So tempus is translated as condition.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-1' href='#cpdv-verse-5-1'>a</a>. <span> The phrase ‘in cleris’ refers to the ordained, as is clear from the subsequent verse, which calls Christ the leader of pastors. Therefore, the elders to whom Peter addresses himself are ordained men, i.e. priests and Bishops.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-2' href='#cpdv-verse-5-2'>b</a>. <span> The word Babylon is here used to refer to Rome. Mark is the writer of the Gospel of Mark, who himself was a student of Peter. Mark is referred to as Peter’s son, because Mark was about the age of a son to Peter and because the relationship was like that of father and son in the Faith.</span></div>
