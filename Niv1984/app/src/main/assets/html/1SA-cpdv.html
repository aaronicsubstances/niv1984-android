<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1'>1 Samuel 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a certain man from Ramah of Zophim, on Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the second was Peninnah. And Peninnah had sons. But Hannah did not have children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And this man went up from his city, on the established days, so that he might adore and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord, were in that place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the day arrived, and Elkanah immolated. And he gave portions to his wife Peninnah, and to all her sons and daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But to Hannah he gave one portion with sorrow. For he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And her rival afflicted her and vehemently distressed her, to a great extent, for she rebuked her that the Lord had closed her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And she did so every year, when the time returned for them to ascend to the temple of the Lord. And she provoked her in this way. And so, she wept and did not take food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, her husband Elkanah said to her: “Hannah, why are you weeping? And why do you not eat? And for what reason do you afflict your heart? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, after she ate and drank at Shiloh, Hannah rose up. And Eli, the priest, was sitting on the seat before the door of the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And since Hannah was bitter in soul, she prayed to the Lord, weeping greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And she made a vow, saying, “O Lord of hosts, if, in looking with favor, you will see the affliction of your servant and will remember me, and will not forget your handmaid, and if you will give to your servant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall pass over his head.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then it happened that, while she multiplied prayers before the Lord, Eli observed her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For Hannah was speaking in her heart, and only her lips moved, and her voice was barely heard. Therefore, Eli considered her to be drunk,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and so he said to her: “How long will you be inebriated? You should take only a little wine, but instead you are drenched.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Responding, Hannah said: “By no means, my lord. For I am an exceedingly unhappy woman, and I drank neither wine, nor anything that can inebriate. Instead, I have poured out my soul in the sight of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>You should not repute your handmaid as one of the daughters of Belial. For I have been speaking from the abundance of my sorrow and grief, even until now.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Eli said to her: “Go in peace. And may the God of Israel grant to you your petition, which you have begged of him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And she said, “I wish that your handmaid may find grace in your eyes.” And the woman went on her way, and she ate, and her countenance was no longer changed for the worse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they rose up in the morning, and they worshipped before the Lord. And they returned and arrived at their own house at Ramah. Then Elkanah knew his wife Hannah. And the Lord remembered her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And it happened that, in the course of days, Hannah conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, because she had requested him from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now her husband Elkanah ascended with his entire house, so that he might immolate to the Lord a solemn sacrifice, with his vow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Hannah did not go up. For she said to her husband, “I will not go, until the infant has been weaned, and until I may lead him, so that he may appear before the sight of the Lord, and may remain always there.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And her husband Elkanah said to her: “Do what seems good to you, and stay until you wean him. And I pray that the Lord may fulfill his word.” Therefore, the woman remained at home, and she breastfed her son, until she withdrew him from milk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And after she had weaned him, she brought him with her, along with three calves, and three measures of flour, and a small bottle of wine, and she led him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh. But the boy was still a young child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they immolated a calf, and they presented the boy to Eli.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Hannah said: “I beg you, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord: I am that woman, who stood before you here, praying to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>I prayed for this child, and the Lord granted to me my petition, which I asked of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Because of this, I have also lent him to the Lord, for all the days when he shall be lent to the Lord.” And they adored the Lord in that place. And Hannah prayed, and she said:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Nothing is holy as the Lord is holy. For there is no other beside you. And nothing is strong as our God is strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Do not continue speaking of great things, boasting. Let what is old depart from your mouth. For the Lord is the God of knowledge, and thoughts are prepared for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The bow of the powerful has been overwhelmed, and the weak have been girded with strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Those who before were filled, have hired themselves out for bread. And the starving have been filled, so that the barren have given birth to many. But she who had borne many sons has become unable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The Lord brings death, and he gives life. He leads away to death, and he brings back again.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Lord impoverishes, and he enriches. He humbles, and he lifts up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He raises up the indigent from the dust, and he lifts up the poor from filth, so that they may sit with princes, and take hold of a throne of glory. For the hinges of the earth belong to the Lord, and he has placed the globe upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He will preserve the feet of his holy ones, and the impious will be silenced in darkness. For no man will prevail by his own strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The adversaries of the Lord will dread him. And over them, he will thunder in the heavens. The Lord will judge the parts of the earth, and he will give dominion to his king, and he will lift up the horn of his Christ.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Elkanah went away to Ramah, to his house. But the boy was a minister in the sight of the Lord, before the face of Eli, the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the sons of Eli were sons of Belial, not knowing the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>nor the priestly office for the people. And so, no matter who had immolated a victim, the servant of the priest would arrive, while the flesh was still cooking, and he would take a three-pronged hook in his hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and put it into the vessel, or into the cauldron, or into the cooking pot, or into the pan, and all that the hook lifted up, the priest took for himself. So they did to all of Israel who arrived at Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In addition, before they burned the fat, the servant of the priest would arrive, and he would say to the one who was immolating: “Give me the flesh, so that I may boil it for the priest. For I will not accept cooked meat from you, but raw.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the one who was immolating would say to him, “First, allow the fat to be burned today, according to custom, and then take for yourself whatever your soul desires.” But in response, he would say to him: “By no means. For you will give it to me now, otherwise I will take it by force.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, the sin of the servants was exceedingly great before the Lord. For they drew men away from the sacrifice of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But Samuel was ministering before the face of the Lord; he was a youth girded with a linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And his mother fashioned a little tunic for him, which she brought to him on the appointed days, ascending with her husband, so that he might immolate the solemn sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife. And he said to him, “May the Lord repay to you offspring from this woman, on behalf of the loan that you offered to the Lord.” And they went away to their own place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then the Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the youth Samuel was magnified with the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all of Israel, and how they were sleeping with the women who were waiting at the door of the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he said to them: “Why are you doing these kinds of things, very wicked things, that I have heard from all the people?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>My sons, do not be willing. For it is no good report that I am hearing, so that you would cause the people of the Lord to transgress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>If a man has sinned against a man, God may be able to be appeased over him. But if a man has sinned against the Lord, who will pray for him?” But they did not listen to the voice of their father, that the Lord was willing to kill them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But the youth Samuel advanced, and grew up, and he was pleasing to the Lord, as well as to men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then a man of God went to Eli, and he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Was I not revealed openly to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel for myself as priest, so that he might ascend to my altar, and burn incense to me, and wear the ephod before me. And I gave to the house of your father all the sacrifices of the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Why have you kicked away my victims and my gifts, which I instructed to be offered in the temple? And why have you given more honor to your sons than to me, so that you eat the first-fruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Because of this, the Lord God of Israel says: I have spoken clearly, so that your house, and the house of your father, may minister in my sight, even forever. But now the Lord says: May this be far from me. Instead, whoever will have glorified me, I will glorify him. But whoever despises me, they will be despised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Behold the days are arriving, when I will cut off your arm, and the arm of the house of your father, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And you will see your rival in the temple, amid all the prosperity of Israel. And there will not be an old man in your house for all days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Yet truly, I will not entirely take away a man of you from my altar, but such that your eyes may fail, and your soul may melt away, and a great part of your house may die out, as it pertains to the state of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But this will be a sign to you, which will happen to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on one day they both will die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will act in accord with my heart and my soul. And I will build a faithful house for him. And he will walk before my Christ for all days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then this will be in the future, that whoever will have remained of your house, he will approach so that he may pray on his behalf. And he will offer a coin of silver, and a twist of bread. And he will say: ‘Permit me, I beg you, one part of the priestly office, so that I may eat a mouthful of bread.’ ”</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-71'>1 Samuel 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord before Eli, and the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no manifest vision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then it happened that, on a certain day, Eli was lying in his place. And his eyes had dimmed, so that he was unable to see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so, to prevent the lamp of God from going out, Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Lord called Samuel. And responding, he said, “Here I am.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again, the Lord continued to call to Samuel. And rising up, Samuel went to Eli, and he said: “Here I am. For you called me.” And he responded: “I did not call you, my son. Return and sleep.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not been revealed to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the Lord continued, and he called to Samuel still a third time. And rising up, he went to Eli.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said: “Here I am. For you called me.” Then Eli understood that the Lord had called the boy. And he said to Samuel: “Go and sleep. And if he calls to you from now on, you will say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’ ” Therefore, Samuel went away, and he slept in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the Lord came, and stood, and he called, just as he had called the other times, “Samuel, Samuel.” And Samuel said, “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the Lord said to Samuel: “Behold, I am accomplishing a word in Israel. Whoever will hear about it, both his ears will ring.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Samuel slept until morning, and he opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Eli called Samuel, and he said, “Samuel, my son?” And responding, he said, “I am here.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it happened that, in those days, the Philistines assembled to fight.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and they positioned their troops against Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-207'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now the donkeys of Kish, the father of Saul, had become lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Take with you one of the servants, and rising up, go out and seek the donkeys.” And when they had passed through mount Ephraim,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-208'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and through the land of Shalishah, and had not found them, they crossed also through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there, and through the land of Benjamin, and they found nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-209'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when they had arrived in the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come, and let us return, otherwise perhaps my father may forget the donkeys, and become anxious over us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-210'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Behold, there is a man of God in this city, a noble man. All that he says, happens without fail. Now therefore, let us go there. For perhaps he may tell us about our way, because of which we have arrived.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-211'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Saul said to his servant: “Behold, let us go. But what will we bring to the man of God? The bread in our sacks has run out. And we have no small gift that we might give to the man of God, nor anything at all.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-212'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The servant again responded to Saul, and he said: “Behold, there is found in my hand a coin of the fourth part of a stater. Let us give it to the man of God, so that he may reveal to us our way.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-213'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>(In past times, in Israel, anyone going to consult God would speak in this way, “Come, and let us go to the seer.” For one who is called a prophet today, in past times was called a seer.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-214'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Saul said to his servant: “Your word is very good. Come, let us go.” And they went into the city, where the man of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-215'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as they were ascending the slope to the city, they found some young women going out to draw water. And they said to them, “Is the seer here?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-216'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And responding, they said to them: “He is. Behold, he is ahead of you. Hurry now. For he came into the city today, since there is a sacrifice for the people today, on the high place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-217'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Upon entering the city, you should find him immediately, before he ascends to the high place for the meal. And the people will not eat until he has arrived. For he blesses the victim, and thereafter those who were called will eat. Now therefore, go up. For you will find him today.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-218'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they ascended into the city. And as they were walking in the midst of the city, Samuel appeared, advancing to meet them, so that he might ascend to the high place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-219'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now the Lord had revealed to the ear of Samuel, one day before Saul had arrived, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-220'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>“Tomorrow, at the same hour that it is now, I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. And you shall anoint him to be the leader over my people Israel. And he will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked with favor upon my people, because their outcry has reached me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-221'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when Samuel had caught sight of Saul, the Lord said to him: “Behold, the man about whom I spoke to you. This one shall rule over my people.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-222'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel, at the middle of the gate, and he said, “Tell me, I beg you: where is the house of the seer?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Samuel responded to Saul, saying: “I am the seer. Ascend before me to the high place, so that you may eat with me today. And I will send you away in the morning. And I shall reveal to you everything that is in your heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-224'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And concerning the donkeys, which were lost the day before yesterday, you should not be anxious, for they have been found.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-225'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And responding, Saul said: “Am I not a son of Benjamin, the least tribe of Israel, and are not my kindred the last among all the families from the tribe of Benjamin? So then, why would you speak this word to me?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-226'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And so Samuel, taking Saul and his servant, brought them into the dining room, and he gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited. For there were about thirty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-227'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Samuel said to the cook, “Present the portion that I gave to you, and which I instructed you to set apart beside you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then the cook lifted up the shoulder, and he placed it before Saul. And Samuel said: “Behold, what remains, set it before you and eat. For it was preserved for you intentionally, when I called the people.” And Saul ate with Samuel on that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they descended from the high place into the town, and he spoke with Saul in the upper room. And he set out a bed for Saul in the upper room, and he slept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-230'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when they had risen in the morning, and it now began to be light, Samuel called to Saul in the upper room, saying, “Rise up, so that I may send you on.” And Saul rose up. And they both departed, that is to say, he and Samuel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-231'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And as they were descending to the very limit of the city, Samuel said to Saul: “Tell the servant to go ahead of us, and to continue on.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Samuel took a little vial of oil, and poured it on his head. And he kissed him, and said: “Behold, the Lord has anointed you as first ruler over his inheritance. And you shall free his people from the hands of their enemies, who are all around them. And this shall be a sign for you that God has anointed you as ruler:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When you will have departed from me this day, you will find two men beside the sepulcher of Rachel, in the parts of Benjamin to the south.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-236'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when you will have departed from there, and will have traveled farther, and will have arrived at the oak of Tabor, in that place three men, who are going up to God at Bethel, will find you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they will have greeted you, they will give you two loaves. And you shall accept these from their hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>After these things, you shall arrive at the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is. And when you will have entered the city there, you will meet a company of prophets, descending from the high place, with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp before them, and they will be prophesying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the Spirit of the Lord will spring up within you. And you shall prophesy with them, and you shall be changed into another man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, when these signs will have happened to you, do whatever your hand will find, for the Lord is with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And you shall descend before me into Gilgal, (for I will descend to you), so that you may offer an oblation, and may immolate victims of peace.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, when he had turned his shoulder, so that he might go away from Samuel, God changed him to another heart. And all these signs occurred on that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they arrived at the above-stated hill, and behold, a group of prophets met him. And the Spirit of the Lord leapt up within him, and he prophesied in their midst.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And one would respond to the other, saying, “And who is their father?” Because of this, it turned into a proverb, “Could Saul also be among the prophets?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-248'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the uncle of Saul said to him, and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And they responded: “To seek the donkeys. But when we did not find them, we went to Samuel.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But today you have rejected your God, who alone saved you from all your evils and tribulations.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-254'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the lot fell upon the tribe of Benjamin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-256'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And after these things, they consulted the Lord as to whether he would soon arrive there. And the Lord responded, “Behold, he is hidden at home.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-257'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And so they ran and brought him there. And he stood in the midst of the people, and he was taller than the entire people, from the shoulders upward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-258'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Samuel said to all the people: “Certainly, you see the one whom the Lord has chosen, that there is not anyone like him among all the people.” And all the people cried out and said, “Long live the king!”</span></div>

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-339'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-1' href='#cpdv-verse-13-1'>a</a>. <span> The expression “son of …” is a common idiomatic expression in Hebrew. Examples: son of death, a dead body; son of perdition, one who is lost; sons of adulterers, these ‘sons’ are not the children of persons who have committed adultery, but rather it is the sons themselves who have committed adultery, behaving as if they are sons of adultery personified.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-2' href='#cpdv-verse-13-2'>b</a>. <span> Saul was appointed king by the people one year after he was anointed king by Samuel, that is, one year after the Spirit of the Lord came to him, so that he became a new man with a new heart, as explained in chapter ten. That is why Sacred Scripture says figuratively that Saul was the son of one year when his reign began.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-3' href='#cpdv-verse-13-3'>c</a>. <span> Then Saul reigned for two years after being appointed king by the people. So the war occurred three years after Saul anointed him, but two years after he was appointed king.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-4' href='#cpdv-verse-13-4'>d</a>. <span> The foolish claim that the correct numbers have been dropped from the text must be false. God’s providence does not permit even the least truth to drop out of Sacred Scripture, nor to become corrupted, nor the least falsehood to enter into Sacred Scripture. Also, from a human point of view, the Jewish scholars gave great weight to numbers and to their figurative meaning. This is reflected in numerous passages where numbers are used symbolically, and this continued even into the New Testament. For example, the 144,000 in the Book of Revelation is a symbolic number. So the Rabbis would not have lost two numbers, from one verse, pertaining to the first king of Israel. It could not have been lost from the written text, not only because of their scrupulosity, but also because the numbers would have been passed on verbally, in their instruction to each generation. Therefore, these numbers are correct.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-5' href='#cpdv-verse-13-5'>e</a>. <span> Usually, when the age of a person in the Old Testament is stated, the expression ‘son of …’ is not used. Instead, the age is simply stated plainly. The use of ‘son of …’ indicates a figure of speech, not a statement of the number of years from birth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-6' href='#cpdv-verse-13-6'>f</a>. <span> Although it was actually Jonathan who struck the garrison of the Philistines, Saul is said to have been the author of the attack since Jonathan was acting under the direction of Saul.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-7' href='#cpdv-verse-13-7'>g</a>. <span> Saul committed a sacrilege. Saul was not a priest, and therefore he should not have offered the sacrifice. Samuel was the priest; Saul was not.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-340'>1 Samuel 14</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-341'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it happened that, on a certain day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the youth who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, which is across from that place.” But he did not reveal this to his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-342'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Moreover, Saul was staying in the furthermost part of Gibeah, below the pomegranate tree that was at Migron. And the people with him were about six hundred men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-343'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, who had been born of Eli, the priest of the Lord at Shiloh, wore the ephod. But the people did not know where Jonathan had gone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-344'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now there were, between the ascents along which Jonathan strove to cross to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks projecting from both sides, and, in the manner of teeth, boulders breaking out from one side and the other. The name of one was Shining, and the name of the other was Thorny.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-345'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>One boulder projected toward the north, opposite Michmash, and the other toward the south, opposite Gibeah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-346'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Jonathan said to the youth who bore his armor: “Come, let us go across to the garrison of these uncircumcised. And perhaps the Lord may act on our behalf. For it is not difficult for the Lord to save, either by many, or by few.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-347'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And his armor bearer said to him: “Do all that is pleasing to your soul. Go wherever you wish, and I will be with you, wherever you will choose.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-348'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Jonathan said: “Behold, we will cross over to these men. And when we will be seen by them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-349'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>if they have spoken to us in this way, ‘Stay until we come to you,’ let us stand still in our place, and not ascend to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But if they will say, ‘Ascend to us,’ let us ascend. For the Lord has delivered them into our hands. This will be the sign to us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-351'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so, both of them appeared before the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “See, the Hebrews have come out from the holes in which they had been hiding.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-352'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan and to his armor bearer, and they said, “Ascend to us, and we will show you something.” And Jonathan said to his armor bearer: “Let us ascend. Follow me. For the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Jonathan ascended, crawling on his hands and feet, and his armor bearer after him. And then, some fell before Jonathan, others his armor bearer killed as he was following him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the first slaughter was made when Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty of the men, in the midst of an area of land that a yoke of oxen would usually plow in a day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And a miracle occurred in the camp, out in the fields. And all of the people of their garrison, who had gone out in order to plunder, were stupefied. And the earth trembled. And it happened as a miracle from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the watchmen of Saul, who were at Gibeah of Benjamin, looked out, and behold, a multitude was thrown down and dispersed, this way and that.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Saul said to the people who were with him, “Inquire and see who has gone out from us.” And when they had inquired, it was found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not present.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of the God.” (For the ark of God was, in that day, with the sons of Israel in that place.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great tumult in the camp of the Philistines. And it was increasing, little by little, and it was being heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Saul, and all the people who were with him, cried out together, and they went to the place of the conflict. And behold, each one’s sword had been turned against his neighbor, and there was a very great slaughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Moreover, the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before, and who had ascended with them into the camp, turned back so that they might be with those of Israel who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Likewise, all the Israelites who had hidden themselves on mount Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines had fled, joined themselves with their own in the battle. And there were with Saul about ten thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the Lord saved Israel on that day. But the fight continued as far as Bethaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the men of Israel were joined together on that day. And Saul made the people swear, saying, “Cursed be the man who will eat bread, until evening, until I am avenged of my enemies.” And the entire people did not consume bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And all the common people went into a forest, in which there was honey on the surface of the field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And so the people entered the forest, and there appeared flowing honey, but no one drew his hand near his mouth. For the people were afraid of the oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people to an oath. And so he extended the top of the staff that he was holding in his hand, and he dipped it in a honeycomb. And he turned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were brightened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And in response, one of the people said, “Your father has bound the people by an oath, saying: ‘Cursed be the man who will eat any bread this day.’ ” (For the people were faint.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And Jonathan said: “My father has troubled the land. You have seen for yourselves that my eyes were brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>How much more so, if the people had eaten from the plunder that they find with their enemies? Would not a greater slaughter have been accomplished among the Philistines?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, on that day, they struck down the Philistines, from Michmash as far as Aijalon. But the people were exceedingly wearied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And turning to the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and they slew them on the ground. And the people ate with blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then they reported to Saul, saying that the people had sinned against the Lord, eating with blood. And he said: “You have transgressed. Roll a great stone to me, here and now.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And Saul said: “Disperse yourselves among the common people, and tell each one of them to bring to me his ox and his ram, and to slay them upon this stone, and to eat, so that you will not sin against the Lord, in eating with blood.” And so, each one, out of all the people, brought his ox, by his own hand, throughout the night. And they slew them there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-375'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Saul built an altar to the Lord. And so, it was then that he first began to build an altar to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-376'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Saul said: “Let us fall upon the Philistines by night, and lay waste to them even until the morning light. And let us not leave behind a man among them.” And the people said, “Do all that seems good in your eyes.” And the priest said, “Let us draw near to God in this place.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-377'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And Saul consulted the Lord: “Shall I pursue the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hands of Israel?” And he did not respond to him on that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-378'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Saul said: “Bring here every single leader of the people. And we shall know and see by whom this sin was committed this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-379'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>As the Lord lives, who is the Savior of Israel, even if it were done by my son Jonathan, without retraction he shall die.” In this, no one among all the people contradicted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-380'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And he said to all of Israel, “Separate yourselves on one side, and I, with my son Jonathan, will be on the other side.” And the people responded to Saul, “Do what seems good in your eyes.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-381'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And Saul said to the Lord, the God of Israel: “O Lord, God of Israel, grant a sign: Why is it that you will not respond to your servant this day? If this iniquity is in me, or in my son Jonathan, grant an indication. Or if this iniquity is in your people, grant a sanctification.” And Jonathan and Saul were discovered, but the people were released.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-382'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And Saul said, “Cast lots between myself and Jonathan, my son.” And Jonathan was caught.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-383'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan revealed to him, and said: “Truly, I tasted a little honey with the top of the staff that was in my hand. And behold, I shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-384'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And Saul said, “May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things, for you shall surely die, Jonathan!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And the people said to Saul: “Why should Jonathan have to die, who has accomplished this great salvation in Israel? This is wrong. As the Lord lives, not one hair of his head should fall to the ground.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Saul withdrew, and he did not pursue the Philistines. And the Philistines went away to their own places.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-388'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And gathering together an army, he struck Amalek. And he rescued Israel from the hand of those who would lay waste to them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Saul said to the Kenite: “Go away, withdraw, and descend from Amalek. Otherwise, I will include you with him. For you showed mercy to all the sons of Israel, when they ascended from Egypt.” And so the Kenite withdrew from the midst of Amalek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Saul struck down Amalek, from Havilah even until you arrive at Shur, which is opposite the region of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he apprehended Agag, the king of Amalek, alive. But all the common people he put to death with the edge of the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-404'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the flocks of sheep, and of the herds, and the garments, and the rams, and all that was beautiful, and they were not willing to destroy them. Yet truly, whatever was vile or worthless, these they demolished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-405'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-406'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>“It displeases me that I have appointed Saul as king. For he has forsaken me, and he has not fulfilled the work of my words.” And Samuel was greatly saddened, and he cried out to the Lord, all night long</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when Samuel had risen while it was still dark, so that he might go to Saul in the morning, it was reported to Samuel that Saul had arrived at Carmel, and that he had erected for himself a triumphant arch. And, while returning, he had continued on and descended to Gilgal. Therefore, Samuel went to Saul. And Saul was offering a holocaust to the Lord, from the best of the spoils, which he had brought from Amalek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when Samuel had gone to Saul, Saul said to him: “You are the blessed of the Lord. I have fulfilled the word of the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-409'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Samuel said, “Then what is this voice of the flocks, which resounds in my ears, and of the herds, which I am hearing?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-410'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Saul said: “They have brought these from Amalek. For the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds, so that they might be immolated to the Lord your God. Yet truly, the remainder we have slain.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-411'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Permit me, and I will reveal to you what the Lord has said to me this night.” And he said to him, “Speak.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-412'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Samuel said: “Was it not when you were little in your own eyes that you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you as king over Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the Lord sent you on the way, and he said: ‘Go and put to death the sinners of Amalek. And you shall fight against them, even unto utter annihilation.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Why then, did you not listen to the voice of the Lord? Instead, you turned to the spoils, and you did evil in the eyes of the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Saul said to Samuel: “On the contrary, I did listen to the voice of the Lord, and I walked in the way along which the Lord sent me, and I led back Agag, the king of Amalek, and I put to death Amalek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But the people took some of the spoils, sheep and oxen, as the first-fruits of those things that were slain, to immolate to the Lord their God at Gilgal.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Samuel said: “Does the Lord want holocausts and victims, and not instead that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifice. And to heed is greater than to offer the fat of rams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Therefore, it is like the sin of paganism to rebel. And it is like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Saul said to Samuel: “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the word of the Lord, and your words, by fearing the people and obeying their voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But now, I beg you, to bear my sin, and to return with me, so that I may adore the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Samuel said to Saul: “I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Samuel turned away, so that he might depart. But Saul took hold of the edge of his cloak, and it tore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-423'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Samuel said to him: “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you this day. And he has delivered it to your neighbor, who is better than you are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Moreover, the One who triumphs within Israel will not spare, and he will not be moved to repentance. For he is not a man, that he should repent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then he said: “I have sinned. But now, honor me before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may adore the Lord your God.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, Samuel turned again after Saul. And Saul adored the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-427'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And Samuel said, “Bring near to me Agag, the king of Amalek.” And Agag, very fat and trembling, was presented to him. And Agag said, “Does bitter death separate in this manner?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And Samuel said, “Just as your sword caused women to be without their children, so will your mother be without her children among women.” And Samuel cut him into pieces, before the Lord at Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-429'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Samuel went away to Ramah. But Saul ascended to his house at Gibeah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-430'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And Samuel did not see Saul any more, until the day of his death. Yet truly, Samuel mourned for Saul, because the Lord regretted that he had appointed him as king over Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-504'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And he took up his staff, which he held always in his hands.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-505'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And the Philistine, advancing, went and drew near against David. And his armor bearer was before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-506'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And when the Philistine had seen and considered David, he despised him. For he was a youth, ruddy and of handsome appearance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-508'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And he said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>But David said to the Philistine: “You approach me with sword, and spear, and shield. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which you have reproached.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-514'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And David prevailed against the Philistine with a sling and a stone. And he struck and killed the Philistine. But since David held no sword in his hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-515'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>he ran and stood over the Philistine, and he took his sword, and withdrew it from the sheath.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-516'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And the men of Israel and Judah, rising up, shouted and pursued after the Philistines, even until they arrived at the valley and as far as the gates of Ekron.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-548'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Saul commanded his servants to speak to David privately, saying: “Behold, you are pleasing to the king, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, be the son-in-law of the king.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-552'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when his servants had repeated to David the words that Saul had spoken, the word was pleasing in the eyes of David, so that he would become son-in-law of the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he took his life in his own hand, and struck down the Philistine.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-564'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Saul had heard this, being pleased by the voice of Jonathan, he swore, “As the Lord lives, he shall not be killed.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Jonathan said to him: “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be sought.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For your seat will be empty until the day after tomorrow. Therefore, you shall descend quickly, and you shall go to the place where you are to be hidden, on a day when it is lawful to work, and you shall remain beside the stone that is called Ezel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And I will shoot three arrows near it, and I will cast them as if I were practicing for myself toward a mark.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Also, I will send a boy, saying to him, ‘Go and bring the arrows to me.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>If I will say to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are before you, take them up,’ you shall approach before me, because there is peace for you, and there is nothing evil, as the Lord lives. But if I will have spoken to the boy in this way, ‘Behold, the arrows are away from you,’ then you shall go away in peace, for the Lord has released you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now about the word that you and I have spoken, may the Lord be between you and me, even forever.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore, David was hidden in the field. And the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-610'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And when the king had sat down on his chair, (according to custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan rose up, and Abner sat beside Saul, and David’s place appeared empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-611'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Saul did not say anything on that day. For he was thinking that perhaps something happened to him, so that he was not clean, or not purified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when the second day after the new moon had begun to dawn, David’s place again appeared empty. And Saul said to Jonathan, his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not arrived to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Jonathan responded to Saul, “He petitioned me earnestly that he might go to Bethlehem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>and he said: ‘Permit me. For there is a solemn sacrifice in the city. One of my brothers has summoned me. Now therefore, if I have found favor in your eyes, I will go quickly, and I will see my brothers.’ For this reason, he has not come to the table of the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then Saul, becoming angry against Jonathan, said to him: “You son of a woman wantonly seizing a man! Could I be ignorant that you love the son of Jesse, to your own shame, and to the shame of your disgraceful mother?</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-616'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-20-2" id="cpdv-verse-20-2">b</a>]</sup></div>

<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-618'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-20-3" id="cpdv-verse-20-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said: “Why should he die? What has he done?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And Saul picked up a lance, so that he might strike him. And Jonathan understood that it had been decided by his father that David be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Therefore, Jonathan rose up from the table in a rage of anger. And he did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was saddened over David, because his father had confounded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when the morning had begun to dawn, Jonathan went into the field according to the agreement with David, and a young boy was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And he said to his boy, “Go, and bring to me the arrows that I shoot.” And when the boy had run, he shot another arrow away from the boy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And so, the boy went to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot. And Jonathan cried out, from behind the back of boy, and said: “Behold, the arrow is there, farther away from you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Jonathan cried out again, from behind the back of the boy, saying, “Go quickly! Do not stand still!” Then Jonathan’s boy collected the arrows, and he brought them to his lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And he did not understand at all what was happening. For only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy, and he said to him, “Go, and carry them into the city.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-628'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And when the boy had gone away, David rose up from his place, which turned toward the south, and falling prone on the ground, he reverenced three times. And kissing one another, they wept together, but David more so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Then Jonathan said to David: “Go in peace. And let us both keep all that we have ever sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘May the Lord be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, even forever.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And David rose up and went away. But Jonathan entered into the city.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-632'>1 Samuel 21</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-633'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then David went into Nob, to the priest Ahimelech. And Ahimelech was astonished that David had arrived. And he said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one is with you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And David said to the priest Ahimelech: “The king has instructed to me a word, and he said: ‘Let no one know the matter about which you have been sent by me, and what type of instructions I have given to you. For I have also summoned servants to one and another place.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now therefore, if you have anything at hand, even five loaves of bread, or whatever you may find, give it to me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the priest, responding to David, said to him: “I have no common bread at hand, but only holy bread. Are the young men clean, especially from women?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David responded to the priest, and said to him: “Indeed, as concerns being with women, we have abstained since yesterday and the day before, when we departed, and so the vessels of the young men have been holy. And although, this journey has been defiled, it will also be sanctified today as concerns the vessels.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, the priest gave to him sanctified bread. For there was no bread there, but only the bread of the Presence, which had been taken away from before the face of the Lord, so that fresh loaves might be set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now a certain man among the servants of Saul was there on that day, inside the tabernacle of the Lord. And his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the most powerful among the shepherds of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then David said to Ahimelech: “Do you have, here at hand, a spear or a sword? For I did not take my own sword, or my own weapons with me. For the word of the king was urgent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the priest said: “Behold, here is the sword of Goliath, the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Terebinth. It is wrapped up in a cloak behind the ephod. If you wish to take this, take it. For there is nothing else here except this.” And David said, “There is nothing else like this, so give it to me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-642'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so, David rose up, and he fled on that day from the face of Saul. And he went to Achish, the king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-643'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the servants of Achish, when they had seen David, said to him: “Is this not David, the king of the land? Were they not singing about him, while dancing, saying, ‘Saul has struck down a thousand, and David ten thousand?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then David took these words to his heart, and he became exceedingly afraid before the face of Achish, the king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he altered his mouth before them, and he slipped down between their hands. And he stumbled against the doors of the gate. And his spit flowed down his beard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Achish said to his servants: “You saw that the man is insane. Why did you bring him to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Or do we have need of those who are mad, so that you would bring in this one, to behave madly in my presence? How did this man get into my house?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then David went away from there, and he fled to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all of his father’s house had heard of it, they descended to him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And all those left in distress, or oppressed by debt to strangers, or bitter in soul, gathered themselves to him. And he became their leader, and about four hundred men were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And David set out from there to Mizpah, which is of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, “I beg you, let my father and my mother remain with you, until I know what God will do for me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he left them before the face of the king of Moab. And they stayed with him for all the days that David was in the stronghold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the prophet Gad said to David: “Do not choose to stay in the stronghold. Set out and go into the land of Judah.” And so, David set out, and he went into the forest of Hereth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Saul heard that David, and the men who were with him, had been seen. Now while Saul was staying in Gibeah, and while he was in the forest that is in Ramah, holding a spear in his hand, with all his servants standing around him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>he said to his servants who were assisting him: “Listen now, you sons of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give to all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make all of you tribunes or centurions,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-657'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>so that you would all conspire against me, and so that there is no one to inform me, especially when even my son has formed a pact with the son of Jesse? There is no one among you who grieves for my situation, or who would report to me. For my son has raised up my servant against me, seeking to betray me, even to this day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-658'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was standing near, and who was first among the servants of Saul, responding, said: “I saw the son of Jesse, in Nob, with Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-659'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he consulted the Lord for him, and he gave him food. Moreover, he gave him the sword of Goliath, the Philistine.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-660'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech, the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all of his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob, and they all came before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-661'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Saul said to Ahimelech, “Listen, son of Ahitub.” He responded, “Here I am, lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-662'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Saul said to him: “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? For you gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted the Lord for him, so that he might rise up against me, continuing as a traitor even to this day.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-663'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And responding to the king, Ahimelech said: “But who among all your servants is as faithful as David? And he is the son-in-law of the king, and he goes forth at your order, and he is a glory within your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-664'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Did I begin to consult the Lord for him today? May this be far from me!

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-665'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the king said, “You shall die a death, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-666'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the king said to the emissaries who were standing around him: “You shall turn, and put to death the priests of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-667'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the king said to Doeg, “You shall turn and rush against the priests.” And Doeg, the Edomite, turned and rushed against the priests.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-668'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then he struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword; he struck down men and women, little ones and infants, as well as ox and donkey and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-669'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaping, fled to David.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-676'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Therefore, David consulted the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and strike down these Philistines?” And the Lord said to David, “Go, and you shall strike down the Philistines, and you shall save Keilah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-677'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the men who were with David said to him, “Behold, we continue in fear here in Judea; how much more so, if we go into Keilah against the troops of the Philistines?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-678'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore, David consulted the Lord again. And responding, he said to him: “Rise up, and go into Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-679'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, David and his men went into Keilah.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-680'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And in that time, when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, was in exile with David, he had descended to Keilah, having an ephod with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-681'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then it was reported to Saul that David had gone to Keilah. And Saul said: “The Lord has delivered him into my hands. For he is enclosed, having entered into a city which has gates and bars.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-705'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then David ascended from there, and he lived in very secure places in Engedi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-706'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And when Saul had returned after pursuing the Philistines, they reported to him, saying, “Behold, David is in the desert of Engedi.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-707'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, Saul, taking three thousand elect men from all of Israel, traveled in order to search for David and his men, even upon the most broken rocks, which are passable only to mountain goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-708'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he arrived at the sheepfolds, which presented themselves along the way. And a cave was in that place, which Saul entered, so that he might ease his bowels. But David and his men were hiding in the interior part of the cave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-709'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the servants of David said to him: “Behold the day, about which the Lord said to you, ‘I will deliver your enemy to you, so that you may do to him as it will be pleasing in your eyes.’ ” Then David rose up, and he quietly cut off the edge of Saul’s cloak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-710'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>After this, his own heart struck David, because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s cloak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-711'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said to his men: “May the Lord be gracious to me, lest I do this thing to my lord, the Christ of the Lord, so that I lay my hand upon him. For he is the Christ of the Lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And David restrained his men with his words, and he would not permit them to rise up against Saul. And so Saul, going out of the cave, continued to undertake his journey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-713'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then David also rose up after him. And departing from the cave, he cried out behind the back of Saul, saying: “My lord, the king!” And Saul looked behind him. And David, bowing himself face down to the ground, reverenced.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-714'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he said to Saul: “Why do you listen to the words of men who say: ‘David seeks evil against you?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-715'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the Lord has delivered you into my hand, in the cave. And I thought that I might kill you. But my eye has spared you. For I said: I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the Christ of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-716'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Moreover, see and know, O my father, the edge of your cloak in my hand. For though I cut off the top of your cloak, I was not willing to extend my hand against you. Turn your soul and see that there is no evil in my hand, nor any iniquity or sin against you. Yet you lie in wait for my life, so that you may take it away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-717'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>May the Lord judge between me and you. And may the Lord vindicate me from you. But my hand will not be against you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So too, it is said in the ancient proverb, ‘From the impious, impiety will go forth.’ Therefore, my hand will not be upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Whom are you pursuing, O king of Israel? Whom are you pursuing? You are pursuing a dead dog, a single flea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>May the Lord be the judge, and may he judge between me and you. And may he see and judge my case, and rescue me from your hand.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when David had completed speaking words in this way to Saul, Saul said, “Could this be your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice, and he wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he said to David: “You are more just than I am. For you have distributed good to me, but I have repaid evil to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And you have revealed this day the good that you have done for me: how the Lord delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For who, when he will have found his enemy, will release him along a good path? So may the Lord repay you for this good turn, because you have acted on my behalf this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-725'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And now I know certainly that you shall be king, and you shall have the kingdom of Israel in your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Swear to me in the Lord that you will not take away my offspring after me, nor take away my name from the house of my father.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And David swore to Saul. Therefore, Saul went away to his own house. And David and his men ascended to places that were more secure.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-729'>1 Samuel 25</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Samuel died, and all of Israel gathered together, and they mourned him. And they buried him at his house in Ramah. And David, rising up, descended to the desert of Paran.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his possessions were at Carmel. And this man was exceedingly great. And three thousand sheep, and one thousand goats were his. And it happened that he was shearing his sheep at Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now the name of this man was Nabal. And the name of his wife was Abigail. And she was a very prudent and beautiful woman. But her husband was hard-hearted, and very wicked, and malicious. And he was of the stock of Caleb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore, when David, in the desert, had heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>he sent ten young men, and he said to them: “Ascend to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name peacefully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And you shall say: ‘Peace be to my brothers and to you, and peace to your house, and peace to whatever you have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I have heard that your shepherds, who were with us in the desert, were shearing. We have never troubled them, nor was anything from the flock missing to them at any time, during the entire time that they have been with us in Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Question your servants, and they will tell you. Now therefore, may your servants find favor in your eyes. For we have arrived on a good day. Whatever your hand will find, give it to your servants and to your son David.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when the servants of David had arrived, they spoke to Nabal all these words in the name of David. And then they were silent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But Nabal, responding to the servants of David, said: “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, servants who are fleeing from their lords are increasing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, shall I take my bread, and my water, and the meat of the cattle that I have slain for my shearers, and give it to men, when I do not know where they are from?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And so the servants of David traveled back along their way. And returning, they went and reported to him all the words that he had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-742'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then David said to his servants, “Let each one gird his sword.” And each one girded his sword. And David also girded his sword. And about four hundred men followed David. But two hundred remained behind with the supplies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-743'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then it was reported to Abigail, the wife of Nabal, by one of his servants, saying: “Behold, David has sent messengers from the desert, so that they might speak kindly to our lord. But he turned them away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-744'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>These men were good enough to us, and were not troublesome. Neither did we ever lose anything, during the entire time that we conversed with them in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-745'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They were a wall to us, as much in the night as in the day, during all the days that we were with them, pasturing the sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-746'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this reason, consider and realize what you should do. For evil has been decided against your husband and against your house. And he is a son of Belial, so that no one is able to speak to him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And so Abigail hurried, and she took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five cooked sheep, and five measures of cooked grain, and one hundred clusters of dried grapes, and two hundred masses of dried figs, and she set them upon donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-748'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And she said to her servants: “Go before me. Behold, I will follow after your back.” But she did not reveal it to her husband, Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-749'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And when she had climbed on a donkey, and was descending to the base of the mountain, David and his men were descending to meet her. And she met them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-750'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And David said: “Truly, in vain have I preserved all that was his in the wilderness, so that nothing perished out of all that belonged to him. And he has repaid evil to me for good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-751'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>May God do these things, by the enemies of David, and may he add these other things, if I leave behind until morning, out of all that belongs to him, anything that urinates against a wall.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-752'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then, when Abigail had seen David, she hurried and descended from the donkey. And she fell upon her face before David, and she reverenced on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-753'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And she fell at his feet, and she said: “May this iniquity be upon me, my lord. I beg you, let your handmaid speak to your ears, and listen to the words of your servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-754'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Let not my lord, the king, I beseech you, set his heart upon this iniquitous man, Nabal. For in accord with his name, he is senseless, and foolishness is with him. But I, your handmaid, did not see your servants, my lord, whom you had sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-755'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Now therefore, my lord, as your soul lives, and as the Lord lives, who has kept your hand to yourself, and has prevented you from coming to blood: now, let your enemies be like Nabal, and like all those who are seeking evil for my lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-756'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Because of this, accept this blessing, which your handmaid has brought to you, my lord. And give it to the young men who follow you, my lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-757'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Forgive the iniquity of your handmaid. For the Lord will surely make for you, my lord, a faithful house, because you, my lord, fight the battles of the Lord. Therefore, let no evil be found in you all the days of your life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-758'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For if a man, at any time, will rise up, pursuing you and seeking your life, the life of my lord will be preserved, as if in the sheave of the living, with the Lord your God. But the lives of your enemies will be spun around, as if with the force of a whirling sling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-759'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Therefore, when the Lord will have done for you, my lord, all the good that he has spoken about you, and when he will have appointed you as leader over Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-760'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>this will not be for you a regret or a scruple of the heart, my lord, that you had shed innocent blood, or had taken revenge for yourself. And when the Lord will have done well for my lord, you shall remember your handmaid.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-761'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And David said to Abigail: “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me. And blessed is your eloquence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-762'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And blessed are you, who prevented me today from going to blood, and from taking revenge for myself with my own hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-763'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But instead, as the Lord God of Israel lives, he has prevented me from doing evil to you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-765'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then David received from her hand all that she had brought to him. And he said to her: “Go in peace to your own house. Behold, I have heeded your voice, and I have honored your face.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-766'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then Abigail went to Nabal. And behold, he was holding a feast for himself in his house, like the feast of a king. And the heart of Nabal was cheerful. For he was greatly inebriated. And she did not reveal a word to him, small or great, until morning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-767'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then, at first light, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife revealed to him these words, and his heart died within himself, and he became like a stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-768'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-769'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: “Blessed is the Lord, who has judged the case of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and who has preserved his servant from evil.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-770'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And David’s servants went to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, so that he might take you to himself as wife.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-771'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And rising up, she reverenced prone on the ground, and she said, “Behold, let your servant be a handmaid, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-772'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And Abigail rose up and hurried, and she climbed upon a donkey, and five girls went with her, her attendants. And she followed the messengers of David, and she became his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-773'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Moreover, David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel. And both of them were his wives.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-779'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Saul encamped at Gibeah on Hachilah, which was opposite the wilderness on the way. But David was living in the desert. Then, seeing that Saul had arrived after him in the wilderness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-780'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>he sent explorers, and he learned that he certainly had arrived in that place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-781'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David rose up secretly, and he went to the place where Saul was.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-782'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>David spoke to Ahimelech, the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, saying, “Who will descend with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will descend with you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-783'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, David and Abishai went to the people by night, and they found Saul lying down and sleeping in the tent, with his spear fixed in the ground at his head.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-784'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Abishai said to David: “God has enclosed your enemy this day in your hands. Now therefore, I will pierce him with my lance, through to the ground, once, and there will not need to be a second.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-807'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath. And so, he did not continue to seek him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-808'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David said to Achish: “If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given to me in one of the cities of this region, so that I may live there. For why should your servant stay in the city of the king with you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-809'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And so, Achish gave Ziklag to him on that day. And for this reason, Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-810'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now the number of days that David lived in the region of the Philistines was four months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-811'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And David and his men went up and took plunder from Geshuri, and from Girzi, and from the Amalekites.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-812'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And David struck the entire land. Neither did he leave alive man or woman. And he took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the garments. And he returned and went to Achish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-813'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Achish said to him, “Whom did you go out against today?” And David responded, “Against the south of Judah, and against the south of Jerahmeel, and against the south of Keni.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-814'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Neither man nor woman was left alive by David. Neither did he lead back any of them to Gath, saying, “Lest perhaps they may speak against us.” David did these things.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-815'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, Achish trusted David, saying: “He has worked much harm against his people Israel. And so, he will be a servant to me forever.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-818'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it happened that, in those days, the Philistines gathered together their troops, so that they might be prepared for war against Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-819'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And David said to Achish, “You know now what your servant will do.” And Achish said to David, “And so, I will appoint you to guard my head for all days.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-820'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Samuel was dead, and all of Israel mourned for him, and they buried him in Ramah, his city. And Saul took away the magi and soothsayers from the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-821'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Philistines gathered together, and they arrived and made camp at Shunem. Then Saul also gathered all of Israel, and he arrived at Gilboa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-822'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was afraid, and his heart was exceedingly terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-823'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he consulted the Lord. But he did not respond to him, neither by dreams, nor by priests, nor by prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-824'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman having a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and consult through her.” And his servants said to him, “There is a woman having a divining spirit at Endor.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, he changed his usual appearance, and he put on other clothes.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the woman said to him: “Behold, you know how much Saul has done, and how he has wiped away the magi and soothsayers from the land. Why then do you set a trap for my life, so that it will be put to death?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, “As the Lord lives, nothing evil will befall you because of this matter.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the woman said to him, “Whom shall I raise up for you?” And he said, “Raise up for me Samuel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when the woman had seen Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and she said to Saul: “Why have you afflicted me? For you are Saul!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the king said to her: “Do not be afraid. What have you seen?” And the woman said to Saul, “I saw gods ascending from the earth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he said to her, “What appearance does he have?” And she said, “An old man ascends, and he is clothed in a cloak.” And Saul understood that it was Samuel. And he bowed himself upon his face on the ground, and he reverenced.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disquieted me, so that I would be raised up?” And Saul said: “I am greatly distressed. For the Philistines fight against me, and God has withdrawn from me, and he is not willing to heed me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore, I have summoned you, so that you would reveal to me what I should do.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Samuel said, “Why do you question me, though the Lord has withdrawn from you, and has crossed over to your rival?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the Lord will do to you just as he spoke by my hand. And he will tear your kingdom from your hand. And he will give it to your neighbor David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For you did not obey the voice of the Lord, and you did not carry out the wrath of his fury upon Amalek. For this reason, the Lord has done to you what you are enduring this day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And immediately, Saul fell stretched out on the ground. For he was terrified by the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him. For he had not eaten bread all that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so, the woman entered to Saul, (for he was very troubled) and she said to him: “Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have placed my life in my hand.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And so now, I ask you to heed the voice of your handmaid, and let me place before you a morsel of bread, so that, by eating, you may recover strength, and you may be able to undertake the journey.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But he refused, and he said, “I will not eat.” But his servants and the woman urged him, and after some time, heeding their voice, he rose up from the ground, and he sat upon the bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hurried and killed it. And taking meal, she kneaded it, and she baked unleavened bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And she set it before Saul and before his servants. And when they had eaten, they rose up, and they walked all through that night.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the leaders of the Philistines said to Achish, “What do these Hebrews intend to do?” And Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines: “Could you be ignorant about David, who was the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, and who has been with me for many days, even years, and I have not found within him anything, from the day that he fled to me, even to this day?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the leaders of the Philistines became angry against him, and they said to him: “Let this man return, and let him settle in his place, which you appointed for him.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Is not this the David, about whom they were singing, while dancing, saying: ‘Saul struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, Achish called David, and he said to him: “As the Lord lives, you are good and righteous in my sight, even in your departure and your return with me in the military camp.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And in response, Achish said to David: “I know that you are good in my sight, like an angel of God. But the leaders of the Philistines have said: ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’</span></div>
