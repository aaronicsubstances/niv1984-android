<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy: to the church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all; making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Being mindful of the work of your faith, and labour, and charity, and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And you became followers of us, and of the Lord; receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead,) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But having suffered many things before, and been shamefully treated (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who proveth our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For neither have we used, at any time, the speech of flattery, as you know; nor taken an occasion of covetousness, God is witness:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and without blame, we have been to you that have believed:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you, (as a father doth his children,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>We testified to every one of you, that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For you are our glory and joy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face, and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do also towards you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-55-4-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-4-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, and have testified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-4-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-4-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-59-4-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-4-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any man’s.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-62-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-63-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-64-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-65-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-66-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-67-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.</span></div>
