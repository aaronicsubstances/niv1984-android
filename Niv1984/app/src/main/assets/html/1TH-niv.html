<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia--your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, did, again and again--but Satan stopped us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Indeed, you are our glory and joy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-4-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-4-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-4-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.</span></div>
