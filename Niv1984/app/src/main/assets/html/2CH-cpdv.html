<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Solomon instructed the whole of Israel, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the rulers, and the judges over all of Israel, and the leaders of the families.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he went away with the entire multitude to the high place of Gibeon, where the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord was, which Moses, the servant of God, made in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim, to the place that he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, the altar of brass, which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had constructed, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And so Solomon sought it, with the entire assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Solomon ascended to the bronze altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered upon it one thousand victims.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But behold, during that night God appeared to him, saying, “Request what you wish, so that I may give it to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to my father David. And you have appointed me as king in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now therefore, O Lord God, let your word be fulfilled, which you promised to my father David. For you have made me king over your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Give to me wisdom and understanding, so that I may enter and depart before your people. For who is able worthily to judge this, your people, who are so great?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then God said to Solomon: “Since this is the choice that pleased your heart, and you did not request wealth and substance and glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even many days of life, since instead you requested wisdom and knowledge so that you may be able to judge my people, over whom I have appointed you as king:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. And I will give to you wealth and substance and glory, so that none of the kings either before you or after you will be similar to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Solomon went from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, before the tabernacle of the covenant, and he reigned over Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen. And they brought to him one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he caused them to be in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the king offered silver and gold in Jerusalem as if they were stones, and cedar trees as if they were sycamores, which grow in the plains in a great multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then horses were brought to him from Egypt and from Kue, by the negotiators of the king, who went and bought for a price:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>a four-horse chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. A similar offer to purchase was made known among all the kingdoms of the Hittites, and among the kings of Syria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Also, he sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying: “Just as you did for my father David, when you sent him cedar wood, so that he might build a house for himself, in which he then lived,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For the house that I desire to build is great. For our God is great, above all gods.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, send to me a learned man, who knows how to work with gold and silver, with brass and iron, with purple, scarlet, and hyacinth, and who knows how to carve engravings, along with these artisans that I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom my father David has prepared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then too, send to me cedar wood, and juniper, and pine from Lebanon. For I know that your servants know how to cut timber from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants,</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-43'>2 Chronicles 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord, in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, as it had been shown to David his father, at the place which David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And these are the foundations, which Solomon set forth so that he might build the house of God: the length in cubits by the first measure sixty, the width in cubits twenty.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-3-1" id="cpdv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Truly, at the front, the portico, which was extended in length according to the measure of the width of the house, was of twenty cubits. Then the height was of one hundred twenty cubits. And he overlaid it on the interior with the purest gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, he covered the greater house with wooden panels of spruce, and he affixed layers of refined gold through it all. And he engraved in them palm trees, and the likeness of little chains interlaced with one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Also, he paved the floor of the temple with the most precious marble, of great beauty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now the gold, with which he covered in layers the house and its beams and posts and walls and doors, was highly refined. And he engraved cherubim on the walls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Also, he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length, in accord with the width of the temple, was of twenty cubits. And its width, similarly, was of twenty cubits. And he covered it with layers of gold, of about six hundred talents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he also made nails of gold, such that each nail weighed fifty shekels. Also, he covered the upper rooms in gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now he also made, in the house of the Holy of Holies, two cherubim as a work of statues. And he covered them with gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The wings of the cherubim extended for twenty cubits, such that one wing had five cubits and it touched the wall of the house, and the other, having five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Similarly, the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, and it touched the wall, and his other wing of five cubits also touched the wing of the other cherub.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And so the wings of both cherubim were stretched out and extended for twenty cubits. Now they were standing upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the exterior house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Also, he made a veil from hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and fine linen. And he wove within it cherubim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And also, before the doors of the temple, there were two pillars, having a height of thirty-five cubits. But their heads were of five cubits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then too, there were something like little chains on the oracle, and he placed these upon the heads of the pillars. And there were one hundred pomegranates, which he placed between the little chains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Also, he placed these pillars in the vestibule of the temple, one to the right, and the other to the left. The one that was on the right, he called Jachin; and the one that was on the left, Boaz.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Also, under it there was the likeness of oxen. And certain engravings encircled the cavity of the sea, along ten cubits of the outside, as if in two rows. Now the oxen were molten.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the sea itself was placed upon the twelve oxen, three of which were looking toward the north, and another three toward the west, then another three toward the south, and the three that remained toward the east, having the sea imposed upon them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now its thickness had the measure of the palm of a hand, and its brim was like the lip of a cup, or like the outturned petal of a lily. And it held three thousand measures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Also, he made ten basins.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he also made ten gold lampstands, according to the form by which they had been ordered to be made. And he set them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Moreover, there were also ten tables. And he placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. Also, there were one hundred gold bowls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then too, he made the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now he placed the sea on the right side, facing the east, toward the south.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Hiram made cooking pots and hooks and bowls. And he completed every work of the king in the house of God,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and cooking pots and hooks and bowls. Hiram, his father, made all the vessels for Solomon, in the house of the Lord, from the purest brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The king cast these in the region near the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But I chose Jerusalem, so that my name would be in it. And I chose David, so that I might appoint him over my people Israel.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And though David, my father, had decided that he would build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But you shall not build the house. Truly, your son, who will go forth from your loins, shall build a house to my name.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore, the Lord has accomplished his word, which he had spoken.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And when Solomon had completed pouring out his prayers, fire descended from heaven, and it devoured the holocausts and the victims. And the majesty of the Lord filled the house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Neither were the priests able to enter into the temple of the Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Moreover, all the sons of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord upon the house.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-153'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king and all the people were immolating victims before the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-154'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And so, king Solomon slaughtered victims: twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred twenty thousand rams. And the king and the entire people dedicated the house of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Also, Solomon sanctified the middle of the atrium in front of the temple of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-157'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, Solomon kept the solemnity, at that time, for seven days, and all of Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath, even to the torrent of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-158'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And on the eighth day, he held a solemn gathering, because he had dedicated the altar over seven days, and he had celebrated the solemnity over seven days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-210'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and also three hundred gold shields, from three hundred gold pieces, which covered each shield. And the king placed them in the armory, which was situated in a forest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-215'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For indeed, the ships of the king went to Tarshish, with the servants of Hiram, once every three years. And they brought from there gold, and silver, and ivory, and primates, and peacocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-216'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And so, Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in wealth and glory.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Rehoboam set out for Shechem. For in that place all of Israel had convened, so that they might appoint him as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But when Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, (indeed he had fled to that place from Solomon) had heard it, he promptly returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-230'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they summoned him, and he arrived with all of Israel. And they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-231'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>“Your father pressed upon us a very difficult yoke. You should govern us more lightly than your father, who imposed on us a heavy servitude, and so lift up some of the burden, so that we may serve you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-232'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But he said, “Return to me after three days.” And when the people had gone away,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-233'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>he took counsel with the elders, who had stood before his father Solomon while he was still living, saying, “What counsel would you give to me, so that I may respond to the people?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they said to him, “If you please this people, and if you soothe them with words of clemency, they will be your servants for all days.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But he set aside the counsel of the elders, and he began to have discussion with the youth, who had been raised with him and who were among his companions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-236'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to them: “How does it seem to you? Or how should I respond to this people, who have said to me, ‘Lift up the yoke that your father imposed upon us?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But they responded like youths, having been raised with him in luxury, and they said: “So shall you speak to the people, who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy; you should lighten it,’ and so shall you respond to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than the back of my father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, and I will place more weight upon it. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Jeroboam, and the entire people, went to Rehoboam on the third day, just as he had instructed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the king responded harshly, abandoning the counsel of the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he spoke according to the will of the youths: “My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, which I will make heavier. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he did not acquiesce to the pleadings of the people. For it was the will of God that his word be fulfilled, which he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah, the Shilonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then the entire people, speaking more harshly to the king, spoke to him in this way: “There is no portion for us in David, and there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel who were living in the cities of Judah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-283'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In place of these, the king made bronze ones, and he delivered them to the leaders of the shield bearers, who were guarding the vestibule of the palace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-301'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And the priests who minister to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron. And the Levites are in their proper order.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-321'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Also, he built fortified cities in Judah. For it was quiet, and in his time no wars had arisen. For the Lord was generously granting peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-322'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he said to Judah: “Let us build these cities, and strengthen them with walls, and fortify them with towers and gates and bars, while all things are at rest from wars.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-323'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now Asa had in his army three hundred thousand men of Judah, carrying shields and spears, and truly, of Benjamin, two hundred eighty thousand men with shields and bows.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-325'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Asa traveled to meet him, and he set up a battle line for the war in the Valley of Zephathah, which is near Mareshah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-326'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he called upon the Lord God, and he said: “O Lord, there is no difference to you, whether you assist by few, or by many.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-327'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And so the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah. And the Ethiopians fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Asa, and the people who were with him, pursued them as far as Gerar.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-329'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they struck all the cities surrounding Gerar. For indeed, a great fear had overwhelmed everyone. And they despoiled the cities, and they carried away much plunder.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then it happened that one of the people shot an arrow indiscriminately, and it struck the king of Israel between the neck and the shoulder.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-429'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And the fight ended on that day. But the king of Israel was standing in his chariot facing the Syrians, even until evening. And he died when the sun set.</span></div>

For he states in a previous verse that he will only speak what the Lord says to him. And next the king immediately recognizes that the statement by Micaiah is lacking in some way. So I conclude that Micaiah was not lying, but was being sarcastic, in a way that was obvious to the king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-469'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For the sons of Ammon and of Moab rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, so that they might slay and destroy them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-471'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Therefore, Jehoshaphat went, and all the people with him, in order to take away the spoils of the dead.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-523'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada having been strengthened, he took the centurions, namely, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and also Azariah, the son of Obed, and Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri, and he formed a pact with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And traveling through Judah, they gathered together the Levites from all of the cities of Judah, and the leaders of the families of Israel, and they went to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the entire multitude formed a pact with the king, in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them: “Behold, the son of the king shall reign, just as the Lord has said concerning the sons of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-526'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore, this is the word that you shall do:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-527'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>One third part of you who arrive on the Sabbath, priests, and Levites, and porters, shall be at the gates. Truly, one third part shall be at the house of the king. And one third shall be at the gate which is called the Foundation. Yet truly, let all the remainder of the common people be in the courts of the house of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-528'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let no one else enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests, and those from the Levites who are ministering. These alone may enter, for they have been sanctified. And let all the remainder of the common people observe the watches of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-529'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then let the Levites encircle the king, each one having his weapons. And if anyone else will have entered into the temple, let him be slain. And may they be with the king, both entering and departing.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-530'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the Levites, and all of Judah, acted in accord with all that the high priest Jehoiada had instructed. And each of them took the men who were under him, and who were arriving by the course of the Sabbath, with those who had fulfilled the Sabbath and who were about to depart. For indeed the high priest Jehoiada had not permitted the companies to depart, which were accustomed to replace one another each week.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-531'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Jehoiada, the priest, gave to the centurions the lances and round shields and crescent shields of king David, which he had dedicated in the house of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-532'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he positioned all the people, holding short swords, from the right part of the temple to the left part of the temple, before the altar and the temple, all around the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And they led out the son of the king. And they imposed the diadem on him, and the testimony.

And they prayed for him, and said, “May the king live!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when Athaliah had heard it, specifically the sound of running and the praising of the king, she entered to the people in the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when she had seen the king standing upon the step at the entrance, and the leaders and companies around him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets, and playing on instruments of various kinds, and the voice of those who were praising, she tore her garments, and she said: “Treason! Treason!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the high priest Jehoiada, going out to the centurions and to the leaders of the army, said to them: “Lead her away, beyond the borders of the temple. And let her be put to death outside, with the sword.” And the priest instructed that she should not be killed in the house of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they laid hands on her neck. And when she had entered the gate for the horses at the king’s house, they put her to death there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Jehoiada formed a covenant between himself and the entire people, and the king, so that they would be the people of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so, all the people entered into the house of Baal, and they destroyed it. And they broke apart his altars and idols. Also, they put to death Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jehoiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord, under the hands of the priests and Levites, whom David had distributed to the house of the Lord so that they might offer holocausts to the Lord, just as it was written in the law of Moses, with gladness and singing, in accord with the disposition of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Also, he appointed porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, so that whoever was unclean for any reason would not enter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he took the centurions, and the most valiant men, and the leaders of the people, and all the common people of the land, and they set out to descend to the king, from the house of the Lord, and to enter through the middle of the upper gate, to the house of the king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-543'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And all the people of the land were rejoicing, and the city was quieted. But Athaliah was slain with the sword.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-554'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For that very impious woman Athaliah and her sons have destroyed the house of God, and they have adorned the shrine of Baal from all the things that had been sanctified in the temple of the Lord.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-557'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And all the leaders and all the people rejoiced. And upon entering, they together took and placed so much into the ark of the Lord that it was filled.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-559'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were in charge of the works of the house of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And those who were hired were working industriously. And the breach in the walls was healed by their hands. And they returned the house of the Lord to a pristine state. And they caused it stand firm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-561'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when they had completed all the works, they brought the remaining part of the money before the king and Jehoiada.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-588'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so, Amaziah separated the army, which had come to him from Ephraim, so that they would return to their place. But having become very angry against Judah, they returned to their own region.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Uzziah, having become angry, while holding in his hand the censer so that he might burn incense, threatened the priests.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed, on one day, one hundred twenty thousand, all of them men of war from Judah, because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>At that time, there was a prophet of the Lord there, named Oded.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Moreover, you wanted to subjugate the sons of Judah and Jerusalem as your men and women servants, which is a work that should never be done. And so you sinned in this matter against the Lord your God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-660'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>In that time, king Ahaz sent to the king of the Assyrians, requesting assistance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-663'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz, the king of Judah, since he had stripped it of help, and had shown contempt for the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-668'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And so, Ahaz, having despoiled and broken apart all the vessels of the house of God, closed up the doors of the temple of God, and made for himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-690'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-695'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And so they slaughtered the bulls. And the priests took up the blood, and they poured it upon the altar.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-696'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They brought the he-goats for sin before the king and the entire multitude. And they laid their hands upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-697'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the priests immolated them, and they sprinkled their blood before the altar, for the expiation of all Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-698'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Also, he situated the Levites in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, according to the disposition of king David, and of the seer Gad, and of the prophet Nathan.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-699'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the Levites stood, holding the musical instruments of David, and the priests held the trumpets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-700'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Hezekiah ordered that they should offer holocausts upon the altar.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-701'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then the entire crowd was adoring, and the singers and those who were holding the trumpeters were exercising their office, until the holocaust was completed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-702'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And when the oblation was finished, the king, and all who were with him, bowed down and adored.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-703'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Hezekiah and the rulers instructed the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph, the seer. And they praised him with great joy, and kneeling down, they adored.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-704'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And now Hezekiah also added: “You have filled your hands for the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-705'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Now the number of the holocausts that the multitude offered was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-706'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And they sanctified to the Lord six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-707'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Truly, the priests were few; neither were they sufficient to remove the pelts from the holocausts.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-30-3' href='#cpdv-verse-30-3'>c</a>. <span> Again in an eschatological interpretation, after the Three Days of Darkness, many persons will celebrate Good Friday and Easter (later than usual that year), despite not having been fully reconciled to the Church, because of the lack of priests and the lack of time between the Three Days of Darkness and the late Easter. Yet this will not be an offense before God, as long as they are repentant from all their mortal sins out of true love of God and neighbor, and intend to confess (and to do whatever else is required to be reconciled) as soon as possible.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Therefore, Hilkiah, and those who had been sent with him by the king, went to Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the vestments.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-864'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Also, concerning this, he bound by oath all who had been found in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accord with the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-881'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests.
