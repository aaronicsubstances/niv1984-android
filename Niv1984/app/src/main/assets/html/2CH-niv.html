<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel--to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Solomon answered God, "You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>God said to Solomon, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and from Kue </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> --the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He conscripted seventy thousand men as carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and thirty-six hundred as foremen over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Solomon sent this message to Hiram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> king of Tyre: "Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom my father David provided.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"Send me also cedar, pine and algum </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> logs from Lebanon, for I know that your men are skilled in cutting timber there. My men will work with yours</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon: "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Hiram added: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth!

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill,</span></div>

He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, David your father.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them in rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then he said: "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>`Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be the leader over my people Israel.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD's musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, "His love endures forever."

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him--a vast assembly, people from Lebo </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>the LORD appeared to him at night and said: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And though this temple is now so imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and say, `Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>People will answer, `Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them--that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'" </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They were also King Solomon's chief officials--two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>On the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD,</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Rehoboam answered, "Come back to me in three days." So the people went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They replied, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, `Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell the people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So all the Israelites went home.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the house of Judah and Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>`This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, walking in the ways of David and Solomon during this time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup><span> a daughter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But didn't you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do?

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the LORD's temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and all the store cities of Naphtali.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Were not the Cushites</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-3" id="niv-verse-16-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: `With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, `These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, `I will entice him.' "`By what means?' the LORD asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"`I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "`You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. `Go and do it.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and say, `This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father's kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: "This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: `You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But you have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Ahaziah was twenty-two </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">a</a>]</sup><span> years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father's death they became his advisers, to his undoing.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-2" id="niv-verse-22-2">b</a>]</sup><span> son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-3" id="niv-verse-22-3">c</a>]</sup><span> in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-4" id="niv-verse-22-4">d</a>]</sup><span> son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Through Ahaziah's visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah's downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, "He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, "The king's son shall reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now this is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>No one is to enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the other men are to guard what the LORD has assigned to them. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men--those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty--for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king--near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, "Long live the king!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them: "Bring her out between the ranks </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-3" id="niv-verse-23-3">c</a>]</sup><span> would be the LORD's people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the hands of the priests, who were Levites, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the LORD's temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the LORD.

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD's temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-1" id="niv-verse-25-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ; she was from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-2" id="niv-verse-25-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-3" id="niv-verse-25-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel--not with any of the people of Ephraim.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why do you consult this people's gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, the king said to him, "Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?" So the prophet stopped but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-4" id="niv-verse-25-4">d</a>]</sup><span> son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: "Come, meet me face to face."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, `Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might hand them over to [Jehoash], because they sought the gods of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-5" id="niv-verse-25-5">e</a>]</sup><span> at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate--a section about six hundred feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-6" id="niv-verse-25-6">f</a>]</sup><span> long.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He was brought back by horse and was buried with his fathers in the City of Judah.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">a</a>]</sup><span> who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-2" id="niv-verse-26-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They confronted him and said, "It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD's temple, leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-3" id="niv-verse-26-3">c</a>]</sup><span> broke out on his forehead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-4" id="niv-verse-26-4">d</a>]</sup><span> --leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The other events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings, for people said, "He had leprosy." And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah--because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD's fierce anger rests on you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then some of the leaders in Ephraim--Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai--confronted those who were arriving from the war.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"You must not bring those prisoners here," they said, "or we will be guilty before the LORD. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The LORD had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-2" id="niv-verse-28-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took them away. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-4" id="niv-verse-28-4">d</a>]</sup><span> He shut the doors of the LORD's temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then these Levites set to work: from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The priests went into the sanctuary of the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the LORD's temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the LORD's altar."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs--all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their kinsmen the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-1" id="niv-verse-29-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>At the king's command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: "People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Do not be like your fathers and brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; submit to the LORD. Come to the sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but the people scorned and ridiculed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the Levites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate [their lambs] to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>who sets his heart on seeking God--the LORD, the God of his fathers--even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests sang to the LORD every day, accompanied by the LORD's instruments of praise. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-30-1" id="niv-verse-30-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.

After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions--each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites--to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-1" id="niv-verse-31-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the LORD's dwelling.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>A large force of men assembled, and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-1" id="niv-verse-32-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of Assyria come and find plenty of water?" they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-2" id="niv-verse-32-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there: </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When Hezekiah says, `The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, `You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!" </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Sennacherib's officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The king also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him: "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world--the work of men's hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-3" id="niv-verse-32-3">c</a>]</sup><span> on every side.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But Hezekiah's heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD's wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the LORD's wrath did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The other events of Hezekiah's reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, carved idols and cast images.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles, the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the LORD's temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The men did the work faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites--all who were skilled in playing musical instruments--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and doorkeepers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD that had been given through Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-1" id="niv-verse-34-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD's anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-2" id="niv-verse-34-2">b</a>]</sup><span> went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-3" id="niv-verse-34-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the son of Hasrah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-4" id="niv-verse-34-4">d</a>]</sup><span> keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>`This is what the LORD says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people--all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-5" id="niv-verse-34-5">e</a>]</sup><span> my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, `This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites--all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD--to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God.

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the LORD's temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the LORD: "Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the directions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow countrymen, the lay people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare [the lambs] for your fellow countrymen, doing what the LORD commanded through Moses."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle--all from the king's own possessions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the administrators of God's temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So at that time the entire service of the LORD was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had ordered.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, "Take me away; I am badly wounded."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they took him out of his chariot, put him in the other chariot he had and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the men and women singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The other events of Josiah's reign and his acts of devotion, according to what is written in the Law of the LORD--</span></div>
