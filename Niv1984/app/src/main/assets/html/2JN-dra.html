<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The ancient to the lady Elect, and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father; in truth and charity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I was exceeding glad, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And this is charity, that we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face to face: that your joy may be full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</span></div>
