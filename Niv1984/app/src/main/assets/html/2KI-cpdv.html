<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1'>2 Kings 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, after the death of Ahab, Moab transgressed against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Ahaziah fell down through the lattices of his upper room, which he had in Samaria, and he was injured. And he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as to whether I may be able to survive this infirmity of mine.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And an Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying: “Rise up, and ascend to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria. And you shall say to them: ‘Is there not a God in Israel, so that you would go to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For this reason, thus says the Lord: From the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.’ ” And Elijah went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the messengers returned to Ahaziah. And he said to them, “Why have you returned?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But they responded to him: “A man met us, and he said to us: ‘Go, and return to the king who sent you. And you shall say to him: Thus says the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said to them: “What was the appearance and dress of that man, who met you and who spoke these words?”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So they said, “A hairy man, with a belt of leather wrapping his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah, the Tishbite.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he sent to him a leader of fifty, with the fifty who were under him. And he ascended to him, sitting at the top of a hill, and he said, “Man of God, the king commanded that you should descend.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And responding, Elijah said to the leader of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty.” And then fire from heaven descended and devoured him and the fifty who were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And again, he sent to him another leader of fifty, and the fifty with him. And he said to him, “Man of God, thus says the king: Hurry, descend.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Responding, Elijah said, “If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty.” And fire from heaven descended and devoured him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Again, he sent a third leader of fifty men and the fifty who were with him. And when he had arrived, he bent his knees before Elijah, and he pleaded with him, and said: “Man of God, do not choose to despise my life and the lives of your servants who are with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Behold, fire from heaven descended and devoured the two previous leaders of fifty and the fifties who were with them. But now I beg you to take pity on my life.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, “Descend with him; fear not.” And so, he arose and descended with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel, from whom you would be able to seek a word, therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so he died, in accord with the word of the Lord, which Elijah spoke. And Jehoram, his brother, reigned in his place, in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. For he had no son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Ahaziah that he worked, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-21'>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘habitus’ refers to dress or to the more general condition of the person; the word ‘figurae’ refers to the appearance of the person. The king asks how he was dressed and what he looked like in order to identify him. The next verse gives the appearance (hairy) and dress (a leather belt around his waist), confirming that this is the correct understanding of the text.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-22'>2 Kings 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it happened that, when the Lord willed to lift up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were going out of Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Elijah said to Elisha: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.” And Elisha said to him, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And when they had descended to Bethel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the sons of the prophets, who were at Bethel, went out to Elisha. And they said to him, “Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?” And he responded: “I know it. Be silent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to Elisha: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And when they had arrived at Jericho,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, drew near to Elisha. And they said to him, “Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?” And he said: “I know it. Be silent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And so, the two of them continued on together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them, and they stood opposite them, at a distance. But the two of them were standing above the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Elijah took his cloak, and he rolled it up, and he struck the waters, which were divided into two parts. And they both went across on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what you wish that I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “I beg you, that twice your spirit may be accomplished in me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he responded: “You have requested a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will have what you requested. But if you do not see, it shall not be.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as they continued on, they were conversing while walking. And behold, a fiery chariot with fiery horses divided the two. And Elijah ascended by a whirlwind into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Elisha saw it, and he cried out: “My father, my father! The chariot of Israel with its driver!” And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own garments, and he tore them into two parts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he picked up the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him. And turning back, he stood above the bank of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he struck the waters with the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said, “Where is the God of Elijah, even now?” And he struck the waters, and they were divided here and there. And Elisha went across.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, watching from a distance, said, “The spirit of Elijah has rested upon Elisha.” And approaching to meet him, they reverenced him prone on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they said to him, “Behold, with your servants there are fifty strong men, who are able to go forth and to seek your lord. For perhaps, the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.” But he said, “Do not send them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they urged him, until he acquiesced and said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men. And after they had searched for three days, they did not find him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And they returned to him, for he was living in Jericho. And he said to them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not send them?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Also, the men of the city said to Elisha: “Behold, this city is a very good habitation, as you yourself perceive, O lord. But the waters are very bad, and the ground is barren.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And so he said, “Bring a new vessel to me, and place salt in it.” And when they had brought it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>he went out to the source of the waters, and he cast the salt into it. And he said: “Thus says the Lord: I have healed these waters, and no longer shall there be death or barrenness in them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then the waters were healed, even to this day, in accord with the word of Elisha, which he spoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then he went up from there into Bethel. And as he was ascending along the way, little boys departed from the city. And they were mocking him, saying: “Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when he had looked back, he saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two bears went out from the forest, and they wounded forty-two boys among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then he went away from there to mount Carmel. And he returned from there into Samaria.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-49'>2 Kings 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Truly, Joram, the son of Ahab, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. And he reigned for twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as his father and mother did. For he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Yet truly, he did adhere to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin; neither did he withdraw from these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mesha, the king of Moab, raised many sheep. And he repaid to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs, and one hundred thousand rams, with their fleece.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when Ahab had died, he transgressed the pact that he had with the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, king Joram departed on that day from Samaria, and he took a count of all of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he sent to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying: “The king of Moab has withdrawn from me. Come to battle with me against him.” And he responded: “I will go up. What is mine, is yours. My people are your people. And my horses are your horses.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he said, “Along which way shall we ascend?” So he responded, “Along the desert of Idumea.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, the king of Israel, and the king of Judah, and the king of Idumea, traveled, and they went by a circuitous path for seven days. But there was no water for the army or for the beasts of burden which were following them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said: “Alas, alas, alas! The Lord has gathered we three kings, so that he might deliver us into the hands of Moab.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may appeal to the Lord through him?” And one of the servants of the king of Israel responded, “Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who poured water upon the hands of Elijah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” And so, the king of Israel, with Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and with the king of Idumea, descended to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel: “What is there between you and me? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother.” And the king of Israel said to him, “Why has the Lord gathered these three kings, so that he might deliver them into the hands of Moab?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Elisha said to him: “As the Lord of hosts lives, in whose sight I stand, if I was not humbled by the face of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, certainly I would neither have listened to you, nor have looked upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now, bring a musician to me.” And while the musician was playing, the hand of the Lord fell upon him, and he said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>“Thus says the Lord: Make, in the channel of this torrent, pit after pit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For thus says the Lord: You shall not see wind or rain. And yet this channel shall be filled with water. And you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts of burden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this is small in the sight of the Lord. So, in addition, he will also deliver Moab into your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And you shall strike every fortified town and every elect city. And you shall cut down every fruitful tree. And you shall obstruct all the sources of water. And you shall cover every excellent field with stones.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then it happened that, in the morning, when the sacrifices were usually to be offered, behold, water was arriving along the way of Idumea, and the land was filled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had ascended so that they might fight against them, gathered all who had been girded with a belt around them, and they stood at the borders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And rising up in early morning, and when the sun was now rising before the waters, the Moabites saw the waters opposite them, which were red like blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they said: “It is the blood of the sword! The kings have fought among themselves, and they have slain one another. Go now, Moab, to the spoils!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they went into the camp of Israel. But Israel, rising up, struck Moab, and they fled before them. And since they had prevailed, they went and struck down Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they destroyed the cities. And they filled up every excellent field, each one casting stones. And they obstructed all the sources of water. And they cut down all the fruitful trees, to such an extent that only brick walls remained. And the city was encircled by the slingers of stones. And a great part of it was struck down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when the king of Moab had seen this, specifically, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men who draw the sword, so that he might break through to the king of Idumea. But they were unable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And taking his firstborn son, who would have reigned in his place, he offered him as a holocaust upon the wall.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now a certain woman, from the wives of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying: “My husband, your servant, is dead.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Elisha said to her: “What do you want me to do for you?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And so she set out. And she came to the man of God, on mount Carmel. And when the man of God had seen her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi: “Behold, it is that Shunammite woman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So then, go to meet her, and say to her, ‘Does all go well concerning you, and your husband, and your son?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when she had arrived at the man of God, on the mount, she took hold of his feet. And Gehazi drew near, so that he might remove her. But the man of God said: “Permit her. For her soul is in bitterness. And the Lord has concealed it from me, and has not revealed it to me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And she said to him: “Did I ask a son from my lord? Did I not say to you, ‘You should not deceive me?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And so he said to Gehazi: “Gird your waist, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If any man will meet you, you shall not greet him. And if anyone greets you, you shall not respond to him. And place my staff upon the face of the boy.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the mother of the boy said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not release you.” Therefore, he rose up, and he followed her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Gehazi had gone before them, and he had placed the staff upon the face of the boy. And there was no voice, nor any response. And so he returned to meet him. And he reported to him, saying, “The boy did not rise up.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Therefore, Elisha entered the house. And behold, the boy was lying dead upon his bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And entering, he closed the door upon himself and the boy. And he prayed to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he climbed up, and lay across the boy. And he put his mouth over his mouth, and his eyes over his eyes, and his hands over his hands. And he leaned himself over him, and the body of the boy grew warm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And returning, he walked around the house, first here and then there. And he went up, and lay across him. And the boy gasped seven times, and he opened his eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And he called Gehazi, and said to him, “Call this Shunammite woman.” And having been called, she entered to him. And he said, “Take up your son.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>She went and fell at his feet, and she reverenced upon the ground. And she took up her son, and departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were living in his sight. And he said to one of his servants, “Set out a large cooking pot, and boil a soup for the sons of the prophets.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And one went out into the field, so that he might collect wild herbs. And he found something like a wild vine, and he gathered from it bitter fruits of the field, and he filled his cloak. And returning, he cut these up for the pot of soup. But he did not know what it was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then they poured it out for their companions to eat. And when they had tasted the mixture, they cried out, saying, “Death is in the cooking pot, O man of God!” And they were unable to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>But he said, “Bring some flour.” And when they had brought it, he cast it into the cooking pot, and he said, “Pour it out for the group, so that they may eat.” And there was no longer any bitterness in the cooking pot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Now a certain man arrived from Baal-Shalishah, carrying, for the man of God, bread from the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and new grain in his satchel. But he said, “Give it to the people, so that they may eat.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And his servant responded to him, “What amount is this, that I should set it before a hundred men?” But he said again: “Give it to the people, so that they may eat. For thus says the Lord, ‘They shall eat, and there shall be still more.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And so, he set it before them. And they ate, and there was still more, in accord with the word of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Naaman, the leader of the military of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man with his lord. For through him the Lord gave salvation to Syria. And he was a strong and rich man, but a leper.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now robbers had gone out from Syria, and they had led away captive, from the land of Israel, a little girl. And she was in the service of the wife of Naaman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And she said to her lady: “I wish that my lord had been with the prophet who is in Samaria. Certainly, he would have cured him of the leprosy that he has.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so, Naaman entered to his lord, and he reported to him, saying: “The girl from the land of Israel spoke in such a manner.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king of Syria said to him, “Go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” And when he had set out, he had taken with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand gold coins, and ten changes of fine clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words: “When you will receive this letter, know that I have sent to you my servant, Naaman, so that you may heal him of his leprosy.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his garments, and he said: “Am I God, so that I could take or give life, or so that this man would send to me to cure a man from his leprosy? Take notice and see that he is seeking occasions against me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when Elisha, the man of God, had heard this, specifically, that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent to him, saying: “Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots, and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will receive health, and you will be clean.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And becoming angry, Naaman went away, saying: “I thought that he would have come out to me, and, standing, would have invoked the name of the Lord, his God, and that he would have touched the place of the leprosy with his hand, and so have healed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, so that I might wash in them and be cleansed?” But then, after he had turned himself away and was leaving with indignation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>his servants approached him, and they said to him: “If the prophet had told you, father, to do something great, certainly you ought to have done it. How much more so, now that he has said to you: ‘Wash, and you will be clean?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he descended and washed in the Jordan seven times, in accord with the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child. And he was made clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And returning to the man of God, with his entire retinue, he arrived, and stood before him, and he said: “Truly, I know there is no other God, in all the earth, except in Israel. And so I beg you to accept a blessing from your servant.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But he responded, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And though he urged him strongly, he did not agree at all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Naaman said: “As you wish. But I beg you to grant to me, your servant, that I may take from here the burden of two mules from the ground. For your servant will no longer offer holocaust or victim to other gods, except to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But there is still this matter, for which you will entreat the Lord on behalf of your servant: when my lord enters the temple of Rimmon, so that he may adore there, and he leans on my hand, if I will bow down in the temple of Rimmon, while he is adoring in the same place, that the Lord may ignore me, your servant, concerning this matter.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Go in peace.” Then he went away from him, in the elect time of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, said: “My lord has spared Naaman, this Syrian, by not receiving from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so, Gehazi followed after the back of Naaman. And when he had seen him running toward him, he leaped down from his chariot to meet him, and he said, “Is all well?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he said: “It is well. My lord has sent me to you, saying: ‘Just now two youths from the sons of the prophets have come to me from mount Ephraim. Give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Naaman said, “It is better that you accept two talents.” And he urged him, and he bound the two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing. And he set them upon two of his servants, who carried them before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when now he had arrived in the evening, he took them from their hands, and he stored them in the house. And he dismissed the men, and they went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then, having entered, he stood before his lord. And Elisha said, “Where are you coming from, Gehazi?” He responded, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But he said: “Was my heart not present, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said, “Take it.” And he extended his hand, and took it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-164'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the king of Syria was fighting against Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “In this and that place, let us set up an ambush.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And so the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God had told him, and he prevented it. And he preserved himself, concerning that place, not merely once or twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-167'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the heart of the king of Syria was disturbed over this matter. And calling together his servants, he said, “Why have you not revealed to me the one who is betraying me to the king of Israel?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And one of his servants said: “By no means, my lord the king!

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-296'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so, Jehu struck down all who had remained from the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his nobles and friends and priests, until no remnant of them was left behind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-297'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he rose up and went to Samaria. And when he had arrived at the shepherds’ cabin along the way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-298'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>he found the brothers of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and he said to them, “Who are you?” And they responded, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah, and we are going down to greet the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-299'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he said, “Take them alive.” And when they had taken them alive, they cut their throats at the cistern beside the cabin, forty-two men. And he did not leave any of them behind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-300'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when he had gone away from there, he found Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him, “Is your heart upright, just as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab said, “It is.” Then he said, “If it is, then give me your hand.” He gave his hand to him. And so he lifted him up to himself in the chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-301'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.” And he gave him a place in his chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-302'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he led him into Samaria. And he struck down all who were left behind of Ahab in Samaria, even to the last one, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke through Elijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-303'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jehu gathered together the entire people. And he said to them: “Ahab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him even more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-304'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be permitted not to come, for great is the sacrifice from me to Baal.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-305'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he said: “Sanctify a day of solemnity for Baal.” And he summoned</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-306'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and sent into all the borders of Israel. And all the servants of Baal came. There was left behind not even one who did not arrive. And they entered into the temple of Baal. And the house of Baal was filled, all the way from end to end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-307'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he said to those who were over the vestments, “Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal.” And they brought forth vestments for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-308'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Jehu, upon entering the temple of Baal with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, said to the worshippers of Baal, “Inquire and see that there is no one with you from the servants of the Lord, but only from the servants of Baal.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-309'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then they entered, so that they might offer victims and holocausts.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-310'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then it happened that, when the holocaust had been completed, Jehu ordered his soldiers and officers, saying: “Enter and strike them down.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-311'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and they took away the statue from the shrine of Baal, and they burned it up</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-312'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and crushed it. They also tore down the temple of Baal, and they made it into a latrine, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-313'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And thus did Jehu wipe away Baal from Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-314'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Yet truly, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Neither did he forsake the golden calves, which were in Bethel and Dan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-316'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Jehu did not take care, so that he might walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-317'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>In those days, the Lord began to be weary of Israel. And Hazael struck them throughout all the parts of Israel,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he commanded them, saying: “This is the word that you must do.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the second year of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel: Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, reigned as king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-400'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And he did what is right before the Lord, yet truly, not like David, his father. He acted in accord with all the things that his father Jehoash did,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>except for this alone: he did not take away the high places. For still the people were immolating, and burning incense, in the high places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when he had obtained the kingdom, he struck down those of his servants who had killed his father, the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But the sons of those who had been killed he did not put to death, in accord with what was written in the book of the law of Moses, just as the Lord instructed, saying: “The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-404'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He struck down ten thousand men of Idumea, in the Valley of the Salt Pits. And he captured ‘the Rock’ in battle, and he called its name ‘Subdued by God,’ even to the present day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-405'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: “Come, and let us see one another.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-406'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Joash, the king of Israel, sent a reply to Amaziah, the king of Judah, saying: “A thistle of Lebanon sent to a cedar, which is in Lebanon, saying: ‘Give your daughter as wife to my son.’ And the beasts of the forest, which are in Lebanon, passed by and trampled the thistle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You have struck and prevailed over Idumea. And your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your own glory, and be seated in your own house. Why would you provoke evil, so that you would fall, and Judah with you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-408'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Amaziah was not quieted. And so Joash, the king of Israel, went up. And he and Amaziah, the king of Judah, saw one another at Beth-shemesh, a town in Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-409'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Judah was struck down before Israel, and they fled, each to their own tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-410'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And truly, Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. And he brought him to Jerusalem. And he breached the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the Corner, four hundred cubits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-411'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he took away all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which were found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king, and he returned to Samaria with hostages.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-412'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Joash, which he accomplished, and his strength, with which he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Joash slept with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And they carried him away on horses. And he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the city of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, at sixteen years from birth, and they appointed him as king in place of his father, Amaziah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He built up Elath, and he restored it to Judah, after which the king slept with his fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah: Jeroboam, the son of Joash, the king of Israel, reigned, in Samaria, for forty-one years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And he did what is evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Wilderness, in accord with the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which he spoke through his servant, the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, who was from Gath, which is in Hepher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-423'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For the Lord saw the exceedingly bitter affliction of Israel, and that they were being consumed, even to those who were enclosed in prison, and even to the least ones, and that there was no one who would help Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But the Lord did not say that he would wipe away the name of Israel from under heaven. So instead, he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his strength, with which he went to battle, and the manner in which he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah, in Israel, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah, his son, reigned in his place.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He hoped in the Lord, the God of Israel. And after him, there was no one similar to him, among all the kings of Judah, nor even among any of those who were before him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-544'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, the Lord was also with him. And he conducted himself wisely in all the things to which he went forth. Also, he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and he did not serve him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh: “We beseech you, that you may speak to us, your servants, in Syriac.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-564'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Rabshakeh responded to them, saying: “Has my lord sent me to your lord and to you, so that I may speak these words, and not instead to the men who are sitting upon the wall, so that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-565'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And so, Rabshakeh stood up, and he exclaimed in a great voice, in the Jews’ language, and he said: “Listen to the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-566'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah lead you astray. For he will not be able to rescue you from my hand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days, Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came and said to him: “Thus says the Lord God: Instruct your house, for you will die, and not live.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-618'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he turned his face to the wall, and he prayed to the Lord, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And before Isaiah departed from the middle part of the atrium, the word of the Lord came to him, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will ascend to the temple of the Lord on the third day?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Isaiah said to him: “This will be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word that he has spoken: Do you wish that the shadow may ascend ten lines, or that it may turn back for the same number of degrees?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Hezekiah said: “It is easy for the shadow to increase for ten lines. And so I do not wish that this be done. Instead, let it turn back for ten degrees.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-711'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And all the priests of the high places, who were in that place, he killed upon the altars. And he burned the bones of the men upon them. And he returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And he instructed all the people, saying: “Keep the Passover to the Lord your God, according to what has been written in the book of this covenant.”</span></div>
