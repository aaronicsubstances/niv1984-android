<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-1-1'>2 Kings 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, after the death of Ahab, Moab transgressed against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Ahaziah fell down through the lattices of his upper room, which he had in Samaria, and he was injured. And he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as to whether I may be able to survive this infirmity of mine.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And an Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying: “Rise up, and ascend to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria. And you shall say to them: ‘Is there not a God in Israel, so that you would go to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For this reason, thus says the Lord: From the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.’ ” And Elijah went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the messengers returned to Ahaziah. And he said to them, “Why have you returned?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But they responded to him: “A man met us, and he said to us: ‘Go, and return to the king who sent you. And you shall say to him: Thus says the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said to them: “What was the appearance and dress of that man, who met you and who spoke these words?”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So they said, “A hairy man, with a belt of leather wrapping his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah, the Tishbite.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he sent to him a leader of fifty, with the fifty who were under him. And he ascended to him, sitting at the top of a hill, and he said, “Man of God, the king commanded that you should descend.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And responding, Elijah said to the leader of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty.” And then fire from heaven descended and devoured him and the fifty who were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And again, he sent to him another leader of fifty, and the fifty with him. And he said to him, “Man of God, thus says the king: Hurry, descend.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Responding, Elijah said, “If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty.” And fire from heaven descended and devoured him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Again, he sent a third leader of fifty men and the fifty who were with him. And when he had arrived, he bent his knees before Elijah, and he pleaded with him, and said: “Man of God, do not choose to despise my life and the lives of your servants who are with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Behold, fire from heaven descended and devoured the two previous leaders of fifty and the fifties who were with them. But now I beg you to take pity on my life.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, “Descend with him; fear not.” And so, he arose and descended with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel, from whom you would be able to seek a word, therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so he died, in accord with the word of the Lord, which Elijah spoke. And Jehoram, his brother, reigned in his place, in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. For he had no son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But the rest of the words of Ahaziah that he worked, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-21-n'>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘habitus’ refers to dress or to the more general condition of the person; the word ‘figurae’ refers to the appearance of the person. The king asks how he was dressed and what he looked like in order to identify him. The next verse gives the appearance (hairy) and dress (a leather belt around his waist), confirming that this is the correct understanding of the text.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it happened that, when the Lord willed to lift up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were going out of Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Elijah said to Elisha: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.” And Elisha said to him, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And when they had descended to Bethel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the sons of the prophets, who were at Bethel, went out to Elisha. And they said to him, “Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?” And he responded: “I know it. Be silent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to Elisha: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And when they had arrived at Jericho,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, drew near to Elisha. And they said to him, “Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?” And he said: “I know it. Be silent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him: “Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan.” And he said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you.” And so, the two of them continued on together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them, and they stood opposite them, at a distance. But the two of them were standing above the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Elijah took his cloak, and he rolled it up, and he struck the waters, which were divided into two parts. And they both went across on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what you wish that I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “I beg you, that twice your spirit may be accomplished in me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he responded: “You have requested a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will have what you requested. But if you do not see, it shall not be.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as they continued on, they were conversing while walking. And behold, a fiery chariot with fiery horses divided the two. And Elijah ascended by a whirlwind into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Elisha saw it, and he cried out: “My father, my father! The chariot of Israel with its driver!” And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own garments, and he tore them into two parts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he picked up the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him. And turning back, he stood above the bank of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he struck the waters with the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him, and they were not divided.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, watching from a distance, said, “The spirit of Elijah has rested upon Elisha.” And approaching to meet him, they reverenced him prone on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they said to him, “Behold, with your servants there are fifty strong men, who are able to go forth and to seek your lord. For perhaps, the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.” But he said, “Do not send them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they urged him, until he acquiesced and said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men. And after they had searched for three days, they did not find him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And they returned to him, for he was living in Jericho. And he said to them: “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not send them?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Also, the men of the city said to Elisha: “Behold, this city is a very good habitation, as you yourself perceive, O lord. But the waters are very bad, and the ground is barren.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And so he said, “Bring a new vessel to me, and place salt in it.” And when they had brought it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>he went out to the source of the waters, and he cast the salt into it. And he said: “Thus says the Lord: I have healed these waters, and no longer shall there be death or barrenness in them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then the waters were healed, even to this day, in accord with the word of Elisha, which he spoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then he went up from there into Bethel. And as he was ascending along the way, little boys departed from the city. And they were mocking him, saying: “Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when he had looked back, he saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two bears went out from the forest, and they wounded forty-two boys among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then he went away from there to mount Carmel. And he returned from there into Samaria.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-49-3'>2 Kings 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Truly, Joram, the son of Ahab, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. And he reigned for twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as his father and mother did. For he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Yet truly, he did adhere to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin; neither did he withdraw from these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mesha, the king of Moab, raised many sheep. And he repaid to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs, and one hundred thousand rams, with their fleece.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when Ahab had died, he transgressed the pact that he had with the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, king Joram departed on that day from Samaria, and he took a count of all of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he sent to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying: “The king of Moab has withdrawn from me. Come to battle with me against him.” And he responded: “I will go up. What is mine, is yours. My people are your people. And my horses are your horses.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he said, “Along which way shall we ascend?” So he responded, “Along the desert of Idumea.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, the king of Israel, and the king of Judah, and the king of Idumea, traveled, and they went by a circuitous path for seven days. But there was no water for the army or for the beasts of burden which were following them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the king of Israel said: “Alas, alas, alas! The Lord has gathered we three kings, so that he might deliver us into the hands of Moab.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may appeal to the Lord through him?” And one of the servants of the king of Israel responded, “Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who poured water upon the hands of Elijah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” And so, the king of Israel, with Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and with the king of Idumea, descended to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel: “What is there between you and me? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother.” And the king of Israel said to him, “Why has the Lord gathered these three kings, so that he might deliver them into the hands of Moab?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Elisha said to him: “As the Lord of hosts lives, in whose sight I stand, if I was not humbled by the face of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, certainly I would neither have listened to you, nor have looked upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now, bring a musician to me.” And while the musician was playing, the hand of the Lord fell upon him, and he said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>“Thus says the Lord: Make, in the channel of this torrent, pit after pit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For thus says the Lord: You shall not see wind or rain. And yet this channel shall be filled with water. And you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts of burden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this is small in the sight of the Lord. So, in addition, he will also deliver Moab into your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And you shall strike every fortified town and every elect city. And you shall cut down every fruitful tree. And you shall obstruct all the sources of water. And you shall cover every excellent field with stones.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then it happened that, in the morning, when the sacrifices were usually to be offered, behold, water was arriving along the way of Idumea, and the land was filled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had ascended so that they might fight against them, gathered all who had been girded with a belt around them, and they stood at the borders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And rising up in early morning, and when the sun was now rising before the waters, the Moabites saw the waters opposite them, which were red like blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they said: “It is the blood of the sword! The kings have fought among themselves, and they have slain one another. Go now, Moab, to the spoils!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-3-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they went into the camp of Israel. But Israel, rising up, struck Moab, and they fled before them. And since they had prevailed, they went and struck down Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-3-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they destroyed the cities. And they filled up every excellent field, each one casting stones. And they obstructed all the sources of water. And they cut down all the fruitful trees, to such an extent that only brick walls remained. And the city was encircled by the slingers of stones. And a great part of it was struck down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when the king of Moab had seen this, specifically, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men who draw the sword, so that he might break through to the king of Idumea. But they were unable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And taking his firstborn son, who would have reigned in his place, he offered him as a holocaust upon the wall.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-99-4-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But when he had taken him, and he had led him to his mother, she placed him upon her knees, until midday, and then he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-100-4-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then she went up and laid him out on the bed of the man of God, and she closed the door. And departing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-101-4-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>she called her husband, and she said: “Send with me, I beg you, one of your servants, and a donkey, so that I may hurry to the man of God, and then return.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-103-4-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And she saddled a donkey, and she instructed her servant: “Drive, and hurry on. You shall cause no delay for me in departing. And do whatever I instruct you to do.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-104-4-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And so she set out. And she came to the man of God, on mount Carmel. And when the man of God had seen her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi: “Behold, it is that Shunammite woman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-105-4-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So then, go to meet her, and say to her, ‘Does all go well concerning you, and your husband, and your son?’ ” And she answered, “It is well.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-106-4-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when she had arrived at the man of God, on the mount, she took hold of his feet.

And the Lord has concealed it from me, and has not revealed it to me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-107-4-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And she said to him: “Did I ask a son from my lord? Did I not say to you, ‘You should not deceive me?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-108-4-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And so he said to Gehazi: “Gird your waist, and take my staff in your hand, and go.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-109-4-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the mother of the boy said, “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not release you.” Therefore, he rose up, and he followed her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-110-4-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Gehazi had gone before them, and he had placed the staff upon the face of the boy.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-111-4-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Therefore, Elisha entered the house. And behold, the boy was lying dead upon his bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-112-4-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And entering, he closed the door upon himself and the boy. And he prayed to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-113-4-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he climbed up, and lay across the boy.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114-4-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And returning, he walked around the house, first here and then there. And he went up, and lay across him. And the boy gasped seven times, and he opened his eyes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-117-4-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Elisha returned to Gilgal.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-118-4-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And one went out into the field, so that he might collect wild herbs.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-119-4-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then they poured it out for their companions to eat. And when they had tasted the mixture, they cried out, saying, “Death is in the cooking pot, O man of God!” And they were unable to eat.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121-4-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Now a certain man arrived from Baal-Shalishah, carrying, for the man of God, bread from the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and new grain in his satchel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-122-4-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And his servant responded to him, “What amount is this, that I should set it before a hundred men?” But he said again: “Give it to the people, so that they may eat.

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-125-5'>2 Kings 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-126-5-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Naaman, the leader of the military of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man with his lord. For through him the Lord gave salvation to Syria. And he was a strong and rich man, but a leper.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-127-5-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now robbers had gone out from Syria, and they had led away captive, from the land of Israel, a little girl. And she was in the service of the wife of Naaman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-128-5-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And she said to her lady: “I wish that my lord had been with the prophet who is in Samaria. Certainly, he would have cured him of the leprosy that he has.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-129-5-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so, Naaman entered to his lord, and he reported to him, saying: “The girl from the land of Israel spoke in such a manner.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-130-5-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king of Syria said to him, “Go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” And when he had set out, he had taken with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand gold coins, and ten changes of fine clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131-5-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words: “When you will receive this letter, know that I have sent to you my servant, Naaman, so that you may heal him of his leprosy.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-132-5-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his garments, and he said: “Am I God, so that I could take or give life, or so that this man would send to me to cure a man from his leprosy? Take notice and see that he is seeking occasions against me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133-5-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when Elisha, the man of God, had heard this, specifically, that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent to him, saying: “Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-134-5-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots, and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-135-5-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will receive health, and you will be clean.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-136-5-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And becoming angry, Naaman went away, saying: “I thought that he would have come out to me, and, standing, would have invoked the name of the Lord, his God, and that he would have touched the place of the leprosy with his hand, and so have healed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-137-5-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, so that I might wash in them and be cleansed?” But then, after he had turned himself away and was leaving with indignation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-138-5-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>his servants approached him, and they said to him: “If the prophet had told you, father, to do something great, certainly you ought to have done it. How much more so, now that he has said to you: ‘Wash, and you will be clean?’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-139-5-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he descended and washed in the Jordan seven times, in accord with the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child. And he was made clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-140-5-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And returning to the man of God, with his entire retinue, he arrived, and stood before him, and he said: “Truly, I know there is no other God, in all the earth, except in Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-141-5-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But he responded, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And though he urged him strongly, he did not agree at all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-142-5-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Naaman said: “As you wish.

For your servant will no longer offer holocaust or victim to other gods, except to the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143-5-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But there is still this matter, for which you will entreat the Lord on behalf of your servant: when my lord enters the temple of Rimmon, so that he may adore there, and he leans on my hand, if I will bow down in the temple of Rimmon, while he is adoring in the same place, that the Lord may ignore me, your servant, concerning this matter.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-144-5-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Go in peace.” Then he went away from him, in the elect time of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-145-5-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, said: “My lord has spared Naaman, this Syrian, by not receiving from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-146-5-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so, Gehazi followed after the back of Naaman. And when he had seen him running toward him, he leaped down from his chariot to meet him, and he said, “Is all well?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-147-5-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he said: “It is well.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-148-5-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Naaman said, “It is better that you accept two talents.” And he urged him, and he bound the two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing. And he set them upon two of his servants, who carried them before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-149-5-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when now he had arrived in the evening, he took them from their hands, and he stored them in the house. And he dismissed the men, and they went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-150-5-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then, having entered, he stood before his lord. And Elisha said, “Where are you coming from, Gehazi?” He responded, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151-5-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But he said: “Was my heart not present, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-192-7-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Elisha said: “Listen to the word of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-193-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And one of the leaders, upon whose hand the king leaned, responding to the man of God, said, “Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly be?” And he said, “You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-194-7-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now there were four lepers beside the entrance of the gate. And they said one to another: “Should we choose to stay here until we die?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-195-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>If we choose to enter the city, we will die from the famine. And if we remain here, we also will die. Therefore, come and let us flee over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we will live. But if they choose to kill us, we will die anyway.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-196-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, they rose up in the evening, so that they might go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they had arrived at the beginning of the camp of the Syrians, they found no one in that place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-197-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For indeed, the Lord had caused them to hear, in the camp of Syria, the sound of chariots and horses, and a very numerous army. And they said one to another: “Behold, the king of Israel has paid wages to the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians against us. And they will overwhelm us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-198-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, they rose up and fled away in the dark. And they left behind their tents and horses and donkeys in the camp. And they fled, desiring to save so much as their own lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-199-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And so, when these lepers had arrived at the beginning of the camp, they entered one tent, and they ate and drank. And they took from there silver, and gold, and clothing. And they went away and hid it. And they returned again to another tent, and similarly, carrying away from there, they hid it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-200-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then they said one to another: “We are not doing the right thing. For this is a day of good news.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-203-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, the gatekeepers went and reported it in the palace of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-204-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he rose up in the night, and he said to his servants: “I tell you what the Syrians have done to us.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-205-7-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But one of his servants responded: “Let us take the five horses that remain in the city (for there were no more amid the entire multitude of Israel, since the rest had been consumed), and sending, we will be able to explore.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-206-7-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, they brought two horses. And the king sent them into the camp of the Syrians, saying, “Go, and see.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-207-7-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they went away after them, as far as the Jordan.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-208-7-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the people, going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-209-7-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the king stationed that leader, on whose hand he leaned, at the gate.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-210-7-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this happened in accord with the word of the man of God, which he had spoken to the king, when he said: “Two measures of barley will be one silver coin, and one measure of fine wheat flour will be one silver coin, at this same time tomorrow, at the gate of Samaria.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-211-7-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then that leader had responded to the man of God, and he had said, “Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly happen?” And he said to him, “You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-212-7-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore, it happened to him just as it had been predicted. For the people trampled him at the gate, and he died.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-215-8-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had caused to live, saying: “Rise up.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-216-8-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And she rose up, and she acted in accord with the word of the man of God. And going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-217-8-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when the seven years had ended, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she departed, so that she might petition the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-218-8-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Describe for me all the great deeds that Elisha has done.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-219-8-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And as he was describing for the king the manner in which he had raised the dead, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying out to the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields. And Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha raised up.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-220-8-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the king questioned the woman. And she explained it to him. And the king appointed a eunuch to her, saying, “Restore to her all that is hers, with all the proceeds of the fields, from the day that she left the land until the present.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-221-8-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Also, Elisha arrived in Damascus, and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was ill. And they reported to him, saying, “The man of God has arrived here.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-222-8-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the king said to Hazael: “Take with you gifts. And go to meet the man of God. And consult the Lord through him, saying: ‘Will I be able to escape from this, my infirmity?’ ”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-224-8-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Elisha said to him: “Go, tell him: ‘You will be healed.’ But the Lord has revealed to me that, dying he shall die.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-225-8-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he stood beside him, and he was so troubled that his face became flushed. And the man of God wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-226-8-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Hazael said to him, “Why is my lord weeping?” And he said: “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel. Their fortified cities you will burn with fire. And their young men you will kill with the sword. And you will destroy their little ones, and tear open the pregnant women.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-227-8-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Hazael said, “But what am I, your servant, a dog, that I would do this great thing?” And Elisha said, “The Lord has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-236-8-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Idumea drew apart, so as not to be under Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah also drew apart, at the same time.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-251-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he rose up and entered into the room. And he poured the oil on his head, and he said: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘I have anointed you as king over Israel, the people of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-260-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he had returned, so that he might be cured at Jezreel, because of his wounds.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-286-10-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And so Jehu wrote letters, and he sent to Samaria, to the nobles of the city, and to those greater by birth, and to those who had raised Ahab’s sons, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-287-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“Immediately when you receive these letters, you who have your lord’s sons, and chariots, and horses, and reinforced cities, and weapons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-288-10-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>choose him who is better and who pleases you from among the sons of your lord, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your lord.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-289-10-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But they were vehemently afraid, and they said: “Behold, two kings were not able to stand before him. So how will we be able to withstand him?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-290-10-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, those who were in charge of the house, and the prefects of the city, and those greater by birth, and those who raised the sons, sent to Jehu, saying: “We are your servants. Whatever you will order, we will do. But we will not appoint a king for ourselves. Do whatever pleases you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-291-10-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then he again wrote letters to them a second time, saying: “If you are mine, and if you obey me, take the heads of the sons of your lord, and come to me at Jezreel at this same hour tomorrow.” Now the sons of the king, being seventy men, were being raised with the nobles of the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-292-10-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when the letters had arrived to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed the seventy men. And they placed their heads in baskets, and they sent these to him at Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-293-10-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then a messenger arrived and reported to him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” And he responded, “Place them in two piles, beside the entrance of the gate, until morning.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-294-10-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when it had become light, he went out. And standing there, he said to all the people: “You are just.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-295-10-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now therefore, see that none of the words of the Lord has fallen to the ground, which the Lord spoke over the house of Ahab, and that the Lord has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-296-10-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so, Jehu struck down all who had remained from the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his nobles and friends and priests, until no remnant of them was left behind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-297-10-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he rose up and went to Samaria. And when he had arrived at the shepherds’ cabin along the way,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-299-10-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he said, “Take them alive.” And when they had taken them alive, they cut their throats at the cistern beside the cabin, forty-two men. And he did not leave any of them behind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-300-10-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when he had gone away from there, he found Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him, “Is your heart upright, just as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab said, “It is.” Then he said, “If it is, then give me your hand.” He gave his hand to him. And so he lifted him up to himself in the chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-301-10-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.” And he gave him a place in his chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-302-10-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he led him into Samaria. And he struck down all who were left behind of Ahab in Samaria, even to the last one, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke through Elijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-303-10-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jehu gathered together the entire people. And he said to them: “Ahab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him even more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-304-10-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-305-10-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he said: “Sanctify a day of solemnity for Baal.” And he summoned</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-306-10-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and sent into all the borders of Israel. And all the servants of Baal came. There was left behind not even one who did not arrive. And they entered into the temple of Baal. And the house of Baal was filled, all the way from end to end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-307-10-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And he said to those who were over the vestments, “Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal.” And they brought forth vestments for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-308-10-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Jehu, upon entering the temple of Baal with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, said to the worshippers of Baal, “Inquire and see that there is no one with you from the servants of the Lord, but only from the servants of Baal.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-309-10-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then they entered, so that they might offer victims and holocausts. But Jehu had prepared for himself eighty men outside.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-310-10-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then it happened that, when the holocaust had been completed, Jehu ordered his soldiers and officers, saying: “Enter and strike them down. Let no one escape.” And the soldiers and officers struck them down with the edge of the sword, and they cast them out. And they went into the city of the temple of Baal,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-311-10-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and they took away the statue from the shrine of Baal, and they burned it up</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-312-10-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and crushed it. They also tore down the temple of Baal, and they made it into a latrine, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-313-10-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And thus did Jehu wipe away Baal from Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-314-10-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Yet truly, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Neither did he forsake the golden calves, which were in Bethel and Dan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-315-10-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then the Lord said to Jehu: “Since you have diligently carried out what was right and pleasing in my eyes, and since you have accomplished, against the house of Ahab, all that was in my heart, your sons shall sit upon the throne of Israel, even to the fourth generation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-316-10-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Jehu did not take care, so that he might walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-317-10-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>In those days, the Lord began to be weary of Israel. And Hazael struck them throughout all the parts of Israel,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-473-16-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-476-16-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>At that time, Rezin, the king of Syria, restored Elath to Syria, and he expelled the Judeans from Elath. And the Idumeans went into Elath, and they have lived there, even to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-477-16-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser, the king of the Assyrians, saying: “I am your servant, and I am your son.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-481-16-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Uriah, the priest, constructed an altar in accord with all that king Ahaz had commanded from Damascus. Uriah, the priest, did so, until king Ahaz arrived from Damascus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-484-16-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But the altar of brass, which was before the Lord, he took away from the face of the temple, and from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple of the Lord.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-485-16-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Also, king Ahaz instructed Uriah, the priest, saying: “Upon the great altar, offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the holocaust of the king, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the entire people of the land, and their sacrifices. But their libations, and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim, you shall pour out upon it.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-486-16-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And so Uriah, the priest, acted in accord with all that king Ahaz had instructed to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-754-25-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the city was enclosed and besieged, even until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-755-25-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>on the ninth day of the month. And a famine prevailed in the city; neither was there bread for the people of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-756-25-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the city was breached. And all the men of war fled in the night along the way of the gate which is between the double wall at the garden of the king. Now the Chaldeans were besieging the city on all sides.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-757-25-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. And all the warriors who were with him were dispersed, and they abandoned him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-758-25-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, having apprehended him, they led the king to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And he was speaking with him in judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-759-25-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he killed the sons of Zedekiah before him, and he dug out his eyes, and he bound him with chains, and he led him away to Babylon.</span></div>
