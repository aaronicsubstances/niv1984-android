<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> putting them into gloomy dungeons </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to be held for judgment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed--an accursed brood!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast without speech--who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity--for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog returns to its vomit," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-48-3'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>They will say, "Where is this `coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-3-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66-3-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen. </span></div>
