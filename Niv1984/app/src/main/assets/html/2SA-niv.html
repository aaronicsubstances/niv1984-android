<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." He said, "The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, `What can I do?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"He asked me, `Who are you?' "`An Amalekite,' I answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Then he said to me, `Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>David asked him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, `I killed the LORD's anointed.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings [of grain]. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul--no longer rubbed with oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"Saul and Jonathan-- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So they stood up and were counted off--twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and came to Mahanaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am I a dog's head--on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76-3-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77-3-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78-3-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79-3-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80-3-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81-3-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83-3-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84-3-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85-3-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86-3-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87-3-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90-3-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91-3-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92-3-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93-3-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house!

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321-13-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322-13-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323-13-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324-13-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325-13-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, `I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326-13-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327-13-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328-13-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329-13-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330-13-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331-13-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332-13-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"Don't, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335-13-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336-13-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337-13-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339-13-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup><span> robe she was wearing.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341-13-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When King David heard all this, he was furious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342-13-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344-13-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345-13-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346-13-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347-13-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348-13-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Absalom ordered his men, "Listen!

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349-13-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350-13-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>While they were on their way, the report came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352-13-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573-20-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575-20-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580-20-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</span></div>
