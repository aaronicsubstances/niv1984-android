<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, in accord with the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to Timothy, most beloved son. Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I give thanks to God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. For without ceasing I hold the remembrance of you in my prayers, night and day,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>desiring to see you, recalling your tears so as to be filled with joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>calling to mind the same faith, which is in you unfeigned, which also first dwelt in your grandmother, Lois, and in your mother, Eunice, and also, I am certain, in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Because of this, I admonish you to revive the grace of God, which is in you by the imposition of my hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of virtue, and of love, and of self-restraint.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And so, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner. Instead, collaborate with the Gospel in accord with the virtue of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>who has freed us and has called us to his holy vocation, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the ages of time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And this has now been made manifest by the illumination of our Savior Jesus Christ, who certainly has destroyed death, and who has also illuminated life and incorruption through the Gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Of this Gospel, I have been appointed a preacher, and an Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For this reason, I also suffer these things. But I am not confounded. For I know in whom I have believed, and I am certain that he has the power to preserve what was entrusted to me, unto that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Hold to the kind of sound words that you have heard from me in the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Guard the good entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit, who lives within us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Know this: that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Instead, when he had arrived in Rome, he anxiously sought me and found me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>May the Lord grant to him to obtain mercy from the Lord in that day. And you know well in how many ways he has ministered to me at Ephesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and by the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses. These things encourage faithful men, who shall then be suitable to teach others also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Labor like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>No man, acting as a soldier for God, entangles himself in worldly matters, so that he may be pleasing to him for whom he has proven himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then, too, whoever strives in a competition is not crowned, unless he has competed lawfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The farmer who labors ought to be the first to share in the produce.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Understand what I am saying. For the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the offspring of David, has risen again from the dead, according to my Gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I labor in this Gospel, even while chained like an evildoer. But the Word of God is not bound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I endure all things for this reason: for the sake of the elect, so that they, too, may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>It is a faithful saying: that if we have died with him, we will also live with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>If we suffer, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful: he is not able to deny himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Insist on these things, testifying before the Lord. Do not be contentious about words, for this is useful for nothing but the subversion of listeners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Be solicitous in the task of presenting yourself before God as a proven and unashamed worker who has handled the Word of Truth correctly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But avoid profane or empty talk. For these things advance one greatly in impiety.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And their word spreads like a cancer: among these are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>who have fallen away from the truth by saying that the resurrection is already complete. And so they have subverted the faith of certain persons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But the firm foundation of God remains standing, having this seal: the Lord knows those who are his own, and all who know the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But, in a large house, there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also those of wood and of clay; and certainly some are held in honor, but others in dishonor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>If anyone, then, will have cleansed himself from these things, he shall be a vessel held in honor, sanctified and useful to the Lord, prepared for every good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So then, flee from the desires of your youth, yet truly, pursue justice, faith, hope, charity, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But avoid foolish and undisciplined questions, for you know that these produce strife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For the servant of the Lord must not be contentious, but instead he must be meek toward everyone, teachable, patient,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>correcting with self-restraint those who resist the truth. For at any time God may give them repentance, so as to recognize the truth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and then they may recover from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</span></div>
