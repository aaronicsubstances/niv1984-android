<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For I have become a minister of the Church, according to the dispensation of God that has been given to me among you, so that I may fulfill the Word of God,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>We are announcing him, correcting every man and teaching every man, with all wisdom, so that we may offer every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>In him, too, I labor, striving according to his action within me, which he works in virtue.</span></div>

The word ‘sensu’ refers to the mind, or to qualities attributed to the mind, such as perception, feeling, understanding. The meaning is that they were understood to be enemies, or were perceived to be enemies, because of their evil works, but then they repented and were forgiven by Christ.</span></div>
