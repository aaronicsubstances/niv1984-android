<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> behalf,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.</span></div>
