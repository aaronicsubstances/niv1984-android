<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To the holy and faithful </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> behalf,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>in whom we have redemption, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> the forgiveness of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> your evil behavior.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> God made you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When Christ, who is your </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</span></div>
