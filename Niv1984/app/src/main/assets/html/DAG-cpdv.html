<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord delivered into his hand Jehoiakim the king of Judah and a portion of the vessels of the house of God. And he carried them away into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure chamber of his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king told Ashpenaz, the chief of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the sons of Israel, and some of the offspring of the king and of the sovereigns:</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>young men, in whom there was no blemish, noble in appearance, and accomplished in all wisdom, cautious in knowledge, and well-educated, and who could stand in the palace of the king, so that he might teach them the letters and the language of the Chaldeans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the king appointed for them provisions for each day, from his own food and from the wine which he himself drank, so that, after being nourished for three years, they would stand in the sight of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now, among those of the sons of Judah, there were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the chief of the eunuchs assigned names to them: to Daniel, Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not be polluted with the king’s meal, nor with the wine he drank, and he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not be contaminated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so God gave Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the leader of the eunuchs.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the leader of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed food and drink for you, who, if he should see that your faces are leaner than those of the other youths your age, you would condemn my head to the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the leader of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When he had heard these words, he tested them for ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But, after ten days, their faces appeared better and fatter than all the children who had eaten from the king’s food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Thereafter, Malasar took away their portions and their wine for drinking, and he gave them roots.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Yet, to these children, God gave knowledge and instruction in every book, and wisdom, but to Daniel, also the understanding of all visions and dreams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when the time was completed, after which the king had said that they would be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before the sight of Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-5" id="cpdv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And, when the king conversed with them, there had not been found any so great in all the world as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and so they stood in the sight of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And in every concept of wisdom and understanding, about which the king consulted with them, he found them to be ten times better than all the seers and astrologers put together, who were in his entire kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-6" id="cpdv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so Daniel remained, even until the first year of king Cyrus.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word tyrannorum could also be translated as tyrants, but in this context it does not seem to refer to tyrannical leaders. The word tyrannorum probably refers to various rulers conquered and subjugated by the king, as opposed to leaders who are part of this king’s own administration. It is interesting that the term “sons” is used to refer to those of Israel, whereas “offspring” is used, perhaps in a somewhat derogatory manner, to refer to the others.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that the chief of the eunuchs “præpositus eunuchorum” is different from the leader of the eunuchs “principis eunuchorum.” The leader of the eunuchs seems to be a step down from the chief of the eunuchs.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Malasar is sometimes replaced in translations with “steward”. He seems to be two steps down in rank, that is, one step down from the leader, and another step down from the chief eunuch. Daniel begins with one of the lowest ranks in this society, as one of the captive sons of Israel. He then moves up to a position akin to that of a student, but he still cannot approach the chief of the eunuchs directly. He must plead his case through intermediaries.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span>The word legumina resembles the English word legume, but is often translated more generally as vegetables. In this case, roots was chosen for the translation of legumina out of deference to the Douay-Rheims translation “let pulse be given us to eat.” Pulse refers to vegetable roots, (somewhat different from our potatoes) which must be beaten as part of their preparation. It is unlikely that these young men in training, captives from a war, having rejected the king’s own food and wine, would be given food as desirable as a variety of fresh vegetables. Rather, they received easily stored vegetables, such as roots.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The chief of the eunuchs brings them in, not the leader of the eunuchs, and not Malasar.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> The word magos is the same word often translated in the Gospel of Matthew as Magi. In this case, it probably refers not merely to wise men or learned men, but those specializing in interpreting the stars, i.e., astrologers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar saw a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream fled from him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Yet the king commanded that the seers, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be gathered together to reveal to the king his dreams. When they arrived, they stood in front of the king.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-2" id="cpdv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king said to them, “I saw a dream, and, being confused in mind, I do not know what I saw.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac, “O king, live forever. Tell the dream to your servants, and we will reveal its interpretation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And in answer, the king said to the Chaldeans, “The memory of it has slipped away from me. Unless you reveal the dream to me, and its meaning, you will be put to death, and your houses will be confiscated.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-3" id="cpdv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if you explain the dream and its meaning, you will receive from me rewards, and gifts, and great honor. Therefore, reveal to me the dream and its interpretation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They answered again and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will reveal its interpretation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The king answered and said, “I am certain that you are stalling for time because you know that the memory of it has slipped away from me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, if you do not reveal to me the dream, there is only one conclusion to be reached about you, that the interpretation is likewise false, and packed full of deception, so as to speak before me until the time passes away. And so, tell me the dream, so that I will also know that the interpretation that you tell me is likewise true.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and they said, “There is no man on earth who can accomplish your word, O king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the answer that you seek, O king, is very difficult. Neither can anyone be found who can reveal it in the sight of the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When he heard this, the king commanded, in fury and in great wrath, that all the wise men of Babylon should be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when the decree had gone forth, the wise men were put to death; and Daniel and his companions were sought, to be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-48-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-5" id="cpdv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Daniel inquired, about the law and the sentence, of Arioch, the general of the king’s army, who had gone forth to execute the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he asked him, who had received the orders of the king, for what reason such a cruel sentence had gone forth from the face of the king. And so, when Arioch had revealed the matter to Daniel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Daniel went in and asked of the king that he would grant him time to reveal the solution to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he went into his house and explained the task to Hananiah, and Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>so that they would seek mercy before the face of the God of heaven, about this mystery, and so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the other wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night. And Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and speaking aloud, he said, “May the name of the Lord be blessed by the present generation and forever; for wisdom and fortitude are his.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>To you, God of our fathers, I confess, and you, I praise.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>After this, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke to him in this way, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel to the king, and he said to him, “I have found a man of the sons of the transmigration of Judah, who would announce the solution to the king.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Do you really think that you can reveal to me the dream that I saw and its interpretation?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Daniel, facing the king, answered and said, “The secret that the king seeks, the wise men, the seers, and the soothsayers are unable to reveal to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-2-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, who has revealed to you, king Nebuchadnezzar, what will happen in the latter times. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed, are such as these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-2-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>You, O king, began to think, while in your blanket, about what will be hereafter. And he who reveals secrets showed you what will happen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66-2-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>To me, likewise, this mystery is revealed, not according to the wisdom that is in me more than in other living things, but so that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and so that you may know the thoughts of your mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67-2-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>You, O king, saw, and behold, something like a great statue. This statue, which was great and high, stood exalted above you, and you considered how terrible it was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68-2-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The head of this statue was of the finest gold, but the breast and the arms were of silver, and further on, the belly and the thighs were of brass;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69-2-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>but the shins were of iron, a certain part of the feet were of iron and another part were of clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70-2-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And so you looked until a stone was broken off without hands from a mountain, and it struck the statue on its feet, which were of iron and clay, and it shattered them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71-2-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold were crushed together and diminished like the ashes of a summer courtyard, and they were quickly taken away by the wind, and no place was found for them; but the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-72-2-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>This is the dream; we will also tell its interpretation before you, O king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73-2-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>You are a king among kings, and the God of heaven has given to you a kingdom, and fortitude, and power, and glory,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-74-2-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>and all the places wherein the sons of men and the beasts of the field dwell. He has likewise given the flying creatures of the air into your hand, and he has placed all things under your realm. Therefore, you are the head of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-75-2-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And after you, another kingdom will rise up, inferior to you, of silver, and another third kingdom of brass, which will rule over the whole world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-76-2-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And the fourth kingdom will be like iron. Just as iron shatters and conquers all things, so will it shatter and crush all these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-2-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Furthermore, because you saw the feet and the toes to be part of potter’s clay and part of iron, the kingdom will be divided, but still, from the slip of iron it will take its origin, since you saw the iron mingled with the earthenware from clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-78-2-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, part of the kingdom will be strong and part will be crushed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-79-2-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Yet, because you saw the iron mingled with pottery from the earth, they will indeed be combined together with the offspring of man, but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron cannot be mixed with earthenware.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-80-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-7" id="cpdv-verse-2-7">g</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-81-2-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>But in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will inspire a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and his kingdom will not be handed over to another people, and it will crush and will consume all these kingdoms, and this kingdom itself will stand in eternity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-82-2-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>In accordance with what you saw, because the stone was torn away from the mountain without hands, and it crushed the earthenware, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God has shown the king what will happen after this. And the dream is true, and its interpretation is faithful.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-83-2-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and adored Daniel, and he commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-84-2-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And so the king spoke with Daniel and said, “Truly, your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and also a revealer of secrets, since you could uncover this mystery.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-85-2-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Then the king raised Daniel to a high rank and gave him many great gifts, and he appointed him as leader over all the provinces of Babylon and as chief of the magistrates over all the other wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-86-2-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>However, Daniel required of the king that he appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the works of the province of Babylon. But Daniel himself was at the king’s door.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-87-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> Notice that this is the second year of Nebuchadnezzar, yet Daniel spent three years preparing to be chosen by Nebuchadnezzar. This is the second year counting from a different point in time, probably from the time that Daniel was chosen as one of the wise men of the kingdom, i.e., “In (Daniel’s) second year, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar....”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The word malefici, in this context, refers to those who practiced black magic. The word Chaldeans generally refers to an ancient Semitic people from Mesopotamia (particularly Babylonia). But the word can also refer to pagan priests who practice the occult. In this context, it probably refers to the most learned among the Chaldean people, many of whom may have had some knowledge of Chaldean occult practices.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The king has forgotten his dream. The word sermo means “word,” but can also refer to a concept or an idea or a plan or, as in this case, a memory.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> Literally “tempus redimitis” means buying back time or recovering time, but the modern expression “stalling for time” is a fitting, slightly less literal, translation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> The verb “interficiebantur” does not merely mean to kill someone. It implies that the killing has been officially ordered or sanctioned, as in an execution, where a criminal is put to death. This word is not generally used to refer to murder.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> The words “scientiam disciplinam” means the skill or knowledge used in teaching; whereas “intelligentibus” means “the understanding” or “those who understand.” The phrase “tempora et ætates” more literally means “shorter periods of time and longer periods of time.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-7' href='#cpdv-verse-2-7'>g</a>. <span> Man is made from the earth, that is why Daniel’s interpretation of earthenware and pottery from the earth speaks of the offspring of man. Iron mixed with earthenware symbolizes an unwise, and ultimately unworkable, mingling of some type of technology (iron) with human nature (earthenware).</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The list of the names of the musical instruments is somewhat modernized. In ancient times, the assortment of musical instruments would have been quite different from those of today.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> These were not merely “homines,” men, but “viri,” that is, men of some influence.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> The word braccis is translated by the Douay-Rheims as coats; however, the word could be bracis, meaning pants, especially in view of the subsequent verse (3:94), where pants are mentioned as being unaffected by the fire. On the other hand, braccis could refer to the arms, that is, to a covering for the arms, in which case “coats” would be an apt translation. Since a different word is used for pants in verse 94, and since the word “vestibus” would already include pants, coats seems to fit the context better.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The word praevaricatorum is difficult to translate succinctly. It refers to one who is supposed to be an advocate or helper, but who colludes with ones enemies (perhaps secretly) instead; in other words, one who betrays trust. Traitor is a fairly close translation; prevaricator in English is too different in meaning from praevaricatorum.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-5' href='#cpdv-verse-3-5'>e</a>. <span> Naphtha refers to any type of oil which comes from the ground, such as mineral oil or “rock oil;” stuppa refers to tow (coarse flax which is used for spinning) or, more generally, to the chaff leftover when the grain is removed from flax; pice is pitch or tar; malleolis is brush or, more generally, any kind of light kindling used for burning.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-6' href='#cpdv-verse-3-6'>f</a>. <span> Or, who beholds the abyss even while sitting on the cherubims.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-7' href='#cpdv-verse-3-7'>g</a>. <span> Spiritus can mean the breath of life within living things (but not the soul), or it can refer to wind or the air or breath from one’s mouth. In this case, a translation is used which permits multiple interpretations.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-8' href='#cpdv-verse-3-8'>h</a>. <span> Gelu can mean frost, ice, snow, icy or snowy weather, cold, or cold weather. In this case, since other types of cold are mentioned in other places (cold, frost, ice, snow), the translation “sleet” nicely combines “ice” and “snowy or icy weather” and “cold weather” in one word.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-9' href='#cpdv-verse-3-9'>i</a>. <span> In the ancient view, the human person is body, soul, and the breath of life (spiritus). At death, the body is buried in a grave, the soul (hopefully) goes to heaven, and the breath of life merely ceases to exist. Thus, spiritus is not another way of referring to the soul, nor is it a separated second soul-like substance, but merely the condition of a body which is alive and which obviously ceases at death. In the modern view, the human person is body and soul. We take for granted the understanding that during life the body has life and at death that bodily life ceases.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-10' href='#cpdv-verse-3-10'>j</a>. <span>Some have claimed that the human person is tripartite (consisting of three parts) based on a misunderstanding of passages in Scripture that refer to spirit as well as soul. Some passages have been misunderstood because they say that man’s spirit ceases to exist when he dies. Such passages are correctly stating that the breath of life (spiritus) ceases to exist upon death; but these passages are not denying the immortality of the soul (animae).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-11' href='#cpdv-verse-3-11'>k</a>. <span> The word optimatibus means aristocrats or nobles. Taken more literally, it refers to the king’s “best.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-12' href='#cpdv-verse-3-12'>l</a>. <span> In the Latin vulgate text, a word in all capital letters is used to begin a quotation from a letter.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-13' href='#cpdv-verse-3-13'>m</a>. <span> Excelsus is repeatedly used to refer to God in the book of Daniel. Some texts translate this the same as the word Altissimus (Most High). But a better translation uses a different wording, Supreme God or the Supreme One, when translating excelsus Deus or the word Excelsus by itself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-219-4-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>I, king Nebuchadnezzar, saw this dream.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-220-4-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-221-4-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The tree that you saw was lofty and strong; its height reached toward heaven, and it could be seen throughout the whole world.</span></div>

This is because the purple color of ancient times was obtained, in a time-consuming and laborious process, from a certain gland in certain types of shellfish. Thousands of these shellfish were required to produce a small amount of the dye, and so the dye was expensive and rare, and usually only found with the very wealthy or the powerful. This color is often called Royal purple, because of its use by kings, or Tyrian purple, after the city which was a center of production and commerce for the dye.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-1' href='#cpdv-verse-8-1'>a</a>. <span> The word Meridiem is sometimes incorrectly translated as South. Later in the book of Daniel, the Latin word for South is used, Austri. But here, a different area of the world is indicated. The Meridian, in my interpretation, refers to central Africa, where the meridians of latitude and longitude cross (just off the coast of central Africa). South is used to refer, instead, to the area of the world formerly the southern part of the great monarch’s (the he-goat’s) kingdom.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-2' href='#cpdv-verse-8-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase “hircus caprarum” literally means a he-goat of she-goats. Caprarum is in the genitive case, which often, but not always, implies possession. However, this phrase can be more loosely, and yet more accurately, translated as “a he-goat among she-goats.” The implication is that the leader symbolized by the he-goat is a leader among a group of other leaders, many of whom are women. This would be very unusual in past centuries, but fits the modern political situation, which is nevertheless unfortunate and offensive to God, wherein women take roles of leadership in society. Traveling across the whole earth without touching the ground was not possible when this book was written, nor for many centuries afterwards; it has only become possible relatively recently.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-3' href='#cpdv-verse-8-3'>c</a>. <span> These are the three kings the Antichrist (the little horn) will put down: the king of the meridian (near the equator), the king of the East, and the king of the strength (the Middle East, where the holy land is and which will be the last bastion of Christianity). The king of the strength is also called the king of the South, because this kingdom used to be the southern part of the great monarch’s kingdom.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-4' href='#cpdv-verse-8-4'>d</a>. <span> The text is not counting 1150 days as 1150 evenings plus 1150 mornings (1150 x 2 = 2300); nor is the text telling us what we already know, that a day includes daytime and nighttime. Here the translation, “From evening until morning,” refers metaphorically to this space of time, i.e., from a time of darkness (evening) until a new day dawns (morning). The time of the Antichrist is a time of darkness, which lasts 2300 days, that is, until the end of his reign. After that end, and a brief time for repentance and the punishment of the unrepentant, Christ returns.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-5' href='#cpdv-verse-8-5'>e</a>. <span> In the phrase “novissimo maledictionis,” novissimo does not mean newest, nor does it mean last, but rather refers, in this context, to something which occurs both at a later time (than the time of Daniel) and earlier than a similar event. The word maledictionis, which often means curse (evil-speaking), refers to an accursed time, that is, to the time often called the tribulation. The tribulation is divided into two parts, occurring in two different time periods; this text refers to the earlier of the two.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-6' href='#cpdv-verse-8-6'>f</a>. <span> The word fortitudine, or strength, is used here and elsewhere to refer to the strength of the Christian faith and to those areas or persons who are strong in the Faith.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-7' href='#cpdv-verse-8-7'>g</a>. <span> Or, understanding strategies, or understanding (intellectual) arguments.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-8' href='#cpdv-verse-8-8'>h</a>. <span> Again, fortitudo is used to refer to the strength of the Christian faith. Literally, it says “his strength will be strengthened.” However, in this case, fortitudo is combined with roborabitur to indicate that the Antichrist’s kind of strength will be reinforced by a strength from out of the midst of the Christian faith. This text refers to false Christians. The Antichrist will increase his advantage by making an alliance with the dishonorable, deceitful, unfaithful, false Christians. It is these false Christians who devise the abomination of desolation as a way to try to destroy the Church from within. The abomination of desolation is a false Eucharist, a perverse imitation of the Blessed Sacrament and the Holy Mass.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-9' href='#cpdv-verse-8-9'>i</a>. <span> Principem is often translated as Prince, but it usually refers not to the king’s son, but to the more general concept of a leader of some kind. The Principem principum is clearly Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords. The phrase “sine manu” can mean “without hand” or “by no human hand,” i.e., that God’s angel strikes him down, or it can mean “without effort,” in that he is struck down by God very easily, without need of great force or a legion of angels.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-10' href='#cpdv-verse-8-10'>j</a>. <span> The word signa can refer to sealing something or to signing something. In this case, the context indicates sealing.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-1' href='#cpdv-verse-9-1'>a</a>. <span> Daniel initially thinks he has understood the number of the years as seventy, but later he is told that it is seventy times seven years, or seventy weeks of years.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> The word confessus is more literally translated as confessed, but is sometimes also translated as “gave thanks.” Even in English, the word confess can have a range of meanings which includes admitting ones errors and acknowledging God’s greatness (and thus thanking Him).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-3' href='#cpdv-verse-9-3'>c</a>. <span> Stillavit super nos means to fall in drops over us, in other words, to rain down upon us.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-4' href='#cpdv-verse-9-4'>d</a>. <span> Sermonem can mean word, but it often refers instead to something more general, to a concept or a message, of some kind.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-5' href='#cpdv-verse-9-5'>e</a>. <span> Literally, “Septuaginta hebdomades” means seventy groups of seven. Here the revelation to Daniel is correcting his misunderstanding; he thought it was seventy years, but the angel informs him it is actually seventy groups of seven (years). The translation uses “weeks of years” because years is clearly implied and because “weeks” is a concise way to say “groups of seven.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-6' href='#cpdv-verse-9-6'>f</a>. <span> The “Christum ducem” is quite a striking expression in the Latin; clearly, to a Christian mind, the translation of Christum as Christ is justified. But, in the case of the leader who arrives after only seven weeks of years, this is not Christ himself, but a Christ-like leader (the great monarch). In the case of the leader who arrives after the additional sixty-two weeks of years, again this cannot be Christ himself (since there is still one more week of years to be completed), but again a Christ-like leader (this time it refers to the king of the South, as well as the Pope). Some translations give the weaker and more ambiguous translation of “Anointed one.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-7' href='#cpdv-verse-9-7'>g</a>. <span> Interestingly, some Christians have misinterpreted the Christum ducem who arrives seven weeks of years after the rebuilding of Jerusalem (that is, after the founding of the State of Israel,) to mean that Christ himself would arrive at this early date (in the late 1990’s A.D.). Such an interpretation is not called for by the text itself.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-8' href='#cpdv-verse-9-8'>h</a>. <span> Again, the Christus who is killed is not Christ himself. Rather, this text refers to the king of the South, a Christian, a Christ-leader, the king of the last bastion of Christianity, the only one of the ten kingdoms that still tolerates Christianity. He is defeated in battle, because of betrayal or denial by some persons, but not by any people who are Christians. Some non-Christians betray him. Then the Antichrist and his people arrive in the Holy Land of Israel and destroy the city and the sanctuary. They also kill the Pope of that time, another Christ-leader. The desolation is the abomination of desolation, which begins at this time, but does not reach its full power until the last half of the Antichrist's reign.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-9' href='#cpdv-verse-9-9'>i</a>. <span> The phrase “hostia et sacrificium” could also be translated as “sacrifice and offering.” The phrase “abominatio desolationis” could also be rendered as “the detestable thing of abandonment.” From a Catholic perspective, the first phrase clearly refers to the Eucharist and the sacrifice of the Mass. Thus, the abomination of desolation is a perverse imitation of the Eucharist and the Mass, a false Eucharist, which continues for about three and one half years, even until the end of the Passion and Crucifixion of the Church and the end of the reign of sin on earth.</span></div>

From the context and from the expression, this phrase would still seem somewhat complementary. She is an exemplary woman – but so young as to be called a daughter rather than a woman. An exemplary young woman, and perhaps the meaning is also that she is too young for the task she has been given.

The phrase is quite ambiguous, in and of itself.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-14' href='#cpdv-verse-11-14'>n</a>. <span> The word rapinas resembles the English word rape, and can mean rape in some contexts. But it tends to have a more general meaning, something like assault (including robbery) and/or the loot obtained from such a robbery. The most steadfast would seem to be the Christians.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-15' href='#cpdv-verse-11-15'>o</a>. <span> The king of the South is not foolish or rash, he knows it is very dangerous to go to war against the North – the only kingdom which can and has repeatedly defeated the South in war. But he will have so many things in his favor, including allies and good fortune, that he enters into a war that he ultimately will lose.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-16' href='#cpdv-verse-11-16'>p</a>. <span> “Et comedentes panem cum eo,” (those who eat bread with him,) could well be a reference to the Eucharist. The king of the South and his kingdom may be the last refuge of Christianity, but it is a sinful kingdom, not a holy one. Here the Antichrist uses unfaithful Christians to help him overcome the kingdom where Christianity has the most influence. Later, he uses a similar tactic (in promoting the abomination of desolation).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-17' href='#cpdv-verse-11-17'>q</a>. <span> These two other kings are the kings of the East and of the Meridian (Africa). They realize the danger of the Antichrist and try to outmaneuver and out-deceive him. The word “malefaciant” can mean to do evil, but in this context (of trying to defeat the Antichrist), it tends more towards the meaning of doing harm.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-18' href='#cpdv-verse-11-18'>r</a>. <span> The holy testament is the Christian faith. He acts against Christianity in the conquered land of the South, where Christianity is strongest, and in the two conquered lands of the two kings.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-19' href='#cpdv-verse-11-19'>s</a>. <span> This text is translated quite differently in other English texts. RSV: “ships of Kittim,” NIV: “Ships of the western coastlands,” NKJV: “ships from Cyprus,” NIRV: “Roman ships,” NLT: “warships from western coastlands.” The Bible has been translated into Latin since the earliest days of the Church, so this Latin text (Trieres, et Romani) may be based on some ancient manuscripts, in Hebrew or Greek, which are not now extant.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-20' href='#cpdv-verse-11-20'>t</a>. <span> The Trieres is a type of warship used by the ancient Greeks. But in Daniel, Greece symbolizes democracy, since that is where democracy first began. So, giving the text a modern interpretation, these warships are from an area which still, at that time in the future, practices some form of democracy. But, though the ships are Greek ships, the crew is Roman, which in the modern context would refer to Roman Catholics (or to Christians in general during a future time when all Christians are united in one Church). This interpretation explains why the Antichrist is indignant against Christianity after his defeat and why he sets out to destroy the Faith about halfway through his reign. Daniel 9:27 refers to this time of half a week of years.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-21' href='#cpdv-verse-11-21'>u</a>. <span> The Antichrist then consults the adversaries of the Christians, those who have abandoned the Christian faith.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-22' href='#cpdv-verse-11-22'>v</a>. <span> Here again the word strength is used to refer to Christianity, as in the sanctuary of the strength, which will be polluted by the abomination of desolation (a false Eucharist). The continual sacrifice is the Eucharist.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-23' href='#cpdv-verse-11-23'>w</a>. <span> The word rapina can mean sexual assault. In other contexts, rapina tends more towards robbery or even the loot obtained by robbery, but in this context rapina refers to physical assaults of various kinds.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-24' href='#cpdv-verse-11-24'>x</a>. <span> The learned are not pure and on fire with the love of God; but some will be brought to this by suffering. Not many, just some. The very learned tend not to be very faithful nor very holy.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-25' href='#cpdv-verse-11-25'>y</a>. <span> The word “iracundia” can refer to anger and is sometimes translated in this context as wrath, that is, until the wrath of God is completed. But such a translation does not fit the context well. The verse is about the Antichrist exalting himself, and acting according to his ill will, and controlling the world, and blaspheming God. This is not yet the Wrath of God on the unrepentant wicked. In this context, the phrase refers to the Passion of the Church, that is, to the great sufferings of the faithful during the reign of the Antichrist.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-26' href='#cpdv-verse-11-26'>z</a>. <span> The phrase “erit in concupiscentiis feminarum” does not mean that he will lust after women, but that women will lust for him.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-27' href='#cpdv-verse-11-27'>{</a>. <span> The illustrious land, terra inclyta, (Dan 11:16) is probably a different land than the glorious land, terram gloriosam. The glorious land appears to be Israel, the holy land.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-28' href='#cpdv-verse-11-28'>|</a>. <span> Fama is rumors, or news, or reports. The word interficiat implies that the killing is an execution, from governmental authority (whether legitimate or not), and not a killing in battle.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-29' href='#cpdv-verse-11-29'>}</a>. <span> Again, illustrious would seem to indicate a different land than the glorious land of Israel.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-3' href='#cpdv-verse-13-3'>c</a>. <span> Sensum can also mean mind or understanding.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-4' href='#cpdv-verse-13-4'>d</a>. <span> Here is one way to refer to sexual relations: concumbere, to lie with (someone).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-5' href='#cpdv-verse-13-5'>e</a>. <span> The word quippe means “of course” or “naturally” or “as you see.” Literally, the phrase says “it was, of course, very hot.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-6' href='#cpdv-verse-13-6'>f</a>. <span> The word smegmata is obscure, translated as “washing balls” by the Douay-Rheims and, alternately, as “ointments.” It refers to whatever type of soap or other substance the persons of that time and place used to wash themselves.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-7' href='#cpdv-verse-13-7'>g</a>. <span> Here is another way to refer to sexual relations: commiscere, to intermingle or to unite.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-10' href='#cpdv-verse-13-10'>j</a>. <span> The word cognatis means relatives, but resembles the word for knowing, and so, it is those who knew her well.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-14' href='#cpdv-verse-13-14'>n</a>. <span> Now the word commisceri, to intermingle is used to refer to sexual relations. Both of these expressions are somewhat euphemistic: to lie together or to intermingle. But both expressions are also fairly blunt and show, in the social and religious context of this story, that the elders are unchaste and unrestrained with their words.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-15' href='#cpdv-verse-13-15'>o</a>. <span> Susanna shows her chastity and self-restraint by not even repeating explicitly the charge against herself.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-16' href='#cpdv-verse-13-16'>p</a>. <span> “Inveterate dierum malorum” translates somewhat loosely as “deep-rooted ancient evil.” More literally, dierum means a long time, malorum means evil or harmful, and inveterate means to become old or to become rooted or to become hardened by age.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-17' href='#cpdv-verse-13-17'>q</a>. <span> This tree is a short evergreen tree found in the Middle East. Notice that Daniel shows more discretion than the elders in the language he uses to describe sexual relations. He uses the more euphemistic and more discrete term “colloquentes sibi.” The term conversation was used by Flavius Josephus to denote sexual relations. It is an ancient euphemistic expression.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-18' href='#cpdv-verse-13-18'>r</a>. <span> Again, Daniel uses a term referring to conversation, loquebantur, to refer to sexual relations. He does the same in the next verse also.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-19' href='#cpdv-verse-13-19'>s</a>. <span> Note that “interficiat” refers to execution by authority and that “vos” is plural. Daniel is saying that God will execute both of these elders for their false testimony against Susanna.</span></div>
