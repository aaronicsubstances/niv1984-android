<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and put in the treasure house of his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The astrologers answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and said: "Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue--an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron--for iron breaks and smashes everything--and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands--a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>At this time some astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> came forward and denounced the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego--who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>King Nebuchadnezzar, To the peoples, nations and men of every language, who live in all the world: May you prosper greatly! </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I said, "Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"In the visions I saw while lying in my bed, I looked, and there before me was a messenger, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> a holy one, coming down from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He called in a loud voice: `Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. "`Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> pass by for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"`The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the beasts of the field, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, `Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live like the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: "What have you done?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The queen, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. "O king, live forever!" she said. "Don't be alarmed! Don't look so pale!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father--your father the king, I say--appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"But you his son, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-4" id="niv-verse-5-4">d</a>]</sup><span> O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"This is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-5" id="niv-verse-5-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"This is what these words mean: Mene </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-6" id="niv-verse-5-6">f</a>]</sup><span> : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Finally these men said, "We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said: "O King Darius, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So King Darius put the decree in writing.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: "Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "The decree stands--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him, "Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Daniel answered, "O king, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>At the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language throughout the land: "May you prosper greatly! </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. "For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Persian.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Daniel said: "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, `Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast--terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"As I looked, "thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. "So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>`The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever--yes, for ever and ever.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws--the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Because of rebellion, the host [of the saints] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, "How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled--the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, "Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. "Son of man," he said to me, "understand that the vision concerns the time of the end."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He said: "I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>His body was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He said, "Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you." And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then he continued, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses--but only for a time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>"His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>"Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>"The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his fathers he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him.

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>"At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Nubians in submission.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-6" id="niv-verse-11-6">f</a>]</sup><span> the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>"At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people--everyone whose name is found written in the book--will be delivered.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Those who are wise </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times and half a time. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-2" id="niv-verse-12-2">b</a>]</sup><span> When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance." </span></div>
