<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>the sons of Israel increased, and they multiplied like seedlings. And having been strengthened exceedingly, they filled the land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Meanwhile, there arose a new king over Egypt, who was ignorant of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to his people: “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are many, and they are stronger than we are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply; and if any war should advance against us, they may be added to our enemies, and having fought against us, they might depart from the land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And so he set over them masters of the works, in order to afflict them with burdens. And they built for Pharaoh the cities of the tabernacles: Pithom and Raamses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the more they oppressed them, so much more did they multiply and increase.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the Egyptians hated the sons of Israel, and they afflicted them and mocked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they led their life directly into bitterness, with hard work in clay and brick, and with all kinds of servitude, so that they were being overwhelmed with the works of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews, (one of whom one was called Shiphrah, another Puah)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the midwives feared God, and so they did not act according to the precept of the king of Egypt, but they kept the males safe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And summoning them, the king said, “What did you intend to do, so that you would save the boys?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They responded: “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. For they themselves have the wisdom of a midwife, and so they give birth before we can come to them.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-2" id="cpdv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore, God acted favorably toward the midwives. And the people increased, and they were strengthened exceedingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And because the midwives feared God, he built houses for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Therefore, Pharaoh instructed all his people, saying: “Whatever will be born of the male sex, cast it into the river; whatever will be born of the female sex, retain it.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The midwives were not lying. The Hebrew women were very hardy and strong, having spent their lives in manual labor and hardship. The Hebrew women also feared that their child would be male and be killed, so they did not call for the midwives, if they could avoid doing so. So, in fact, they did often give birth before the midwives arrived. They also likely had some obstetrical knowledge handed down through their families, because the Hebrew people had strong extended families. So, the statements by the midwives were true. They did not reveal the additional truth that when they were present for the birth, they deliberately helped to preserve the males from death. But they did not lie.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the sister of the boy said to her: “If you wish, I will go and call to you a Hebrew woman, who will be able nurse the infant.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>She responded, “Go.” The maid went directly and called her mother.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And she adopted him in place of a son, and she called his name Moses, saying, “Because I took him from the water.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In those days, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers. And he saw their affliction and an Egyptian man striking a certain one of the Hebrews, his brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when he had looked around this way and that, and had seen no one nearby, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Pharaoh heard this talk, and he sought to kill Moses. But fleeing from his sight, he stayed in the land of Midian, and he sat down next to a well.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>In truth, after a long time, the king of Egypt was dead. And the sons of Israel, groaning, cried out because of the works. And their cry ascended to God from the works.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-1' href='#cpdv-verse-18-1'>a</a>. <span> The Egyptians, in other words, acted arrogantly against Israel because the God of Israel is above all the other gods. So Jethro is saying that the Egyptians were upset that their slaves had the one true God, while their gods were not true.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-2' href='#cpdv-verse-18-2'>b</a>. <span> A leader of ten was not a leader over only ten men, but over ten men who were each head of a family. Also, why have a leader over fifty men and also over one hundred? My interpretation is that the leader over 50 was leader over 50 leaders of ten, and the leader over 100 was a leader over 100 leaders of 50. So the ten-leader governed ten men with wives and children, the fifty-leader governed 500 men by governing 50 leaders of 10 (50 x 10), and the hundred-leader governed 50,000 men (100 x 50 x 10).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-3' href='#cpdv-verse-18-3'>c</a>. <span> Otherwise, there would be too many leaders for Moses to oversee, and too many for him to even find and appoint. There were over 600,000 men (Ex. 38:25) over the age of 20 (most with wives and children). So if a hundred-leader governed only 100 men, then there would be 6,000 of such leaders, plus 12,000 leaders of 50, plus 60,000 leaders of ten men. This approach seems unlikely and unworkable.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-4' href='#cpdv-verse-18-4'>d</a>. <span> Using the other approach, there would be 12 leaders of one hundred, 1,200 leaders of 50, and 60,000 leaders of ten. This approach is more tenable and more practical. Also,  the tribunes were not leaders over a thousand, but were like a court of appeals, to avoid unfairness or arbitrary judgments by the leaders. The tribunes governed the other leaders.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-34-3' href='#cpdv-verse-34-3'>c</a>. <span> The three feasts are Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, so the feast or solemnity at the end of the year would be the Feast of Tabernacles, which occurs at the end of the civil calendar year and at the end of the year counted from the start of planting grain in the fall.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-34-4' href='#cpdv-verse-34-4'>d</a>. <span> The Latin text clearly refers to horns on Moses. Some say that this is an ancient misunderstanding (which they attribute to Saint Jerome) of the Hebrew word ‘qaran’ which can refer to horns or to rays of light. In any case, Moses was a figure and a foreshadowing of Christ, the Lamb of God, so it is fitting that Moses be depicted with horns.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-34-5' href='#cpdv-verse-34-5'>e</a>. <span> In this translation, however, the Hebrew text will be used to correct the Latin. The Neo-Vulgate and the Jerusalem Bible Readers Edition and online sources were consulted on this point.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-35-1' href='#cpdv-verse-35-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘vermillion’ is derived from the Latin vermiculus, originally referring to dyes made from some type of grub or larvae. However, in ancient Egypt the color may have been made by grinding minerals containing mercury sulfide (also called cinnabar). So the hyacinth was made from flowers (as Flavius Josephus attests), the purple was made from mollusks in the sea, the scarlet (in Latin: coccum, referring to cochineal carmine) described in other verses was made from insects, and the vermillion may well have been made from minerals (cinnabar). The violet skins are not referred to as ‘dyed’ but seem to have been that color naturally. So then, the Tabernacle had colors from all of nature: from sea and land, from plants, insects, animals, and minerals.</span></div>
