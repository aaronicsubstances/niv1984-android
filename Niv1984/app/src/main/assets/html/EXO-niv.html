<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I drew him out of the water."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43-2-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-2-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49-2-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50-2-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58-3-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-3-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey--the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</span></div>
