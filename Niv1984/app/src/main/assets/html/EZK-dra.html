<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chadeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud,and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf’s foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they had faces, and wings on the four sides,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps.

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Withersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.</span></div>
