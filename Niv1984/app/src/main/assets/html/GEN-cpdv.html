<div id='cpdv-bookmark-46'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Heaven was created first, then earth. The creation of angels also occurred with the creation of heaven. The creation of earth is really the creation of the universe, and subsequently earth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> After earth was created, it was empty and unoccupied. Darkness is plural in the Latin. This could symbolize fallen angels, with the abyss symbolizing Hell. The word ‘darknesses’ can also refer to the absences of so many good things, so that God had to continue creating. The Spirit of God was brought or was carried over the waters, passive tense.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> God created light. Darkness, as the absence of light, became by default. Similarly with evil. God created the heavens and the angels, but some angels fell and so Hell (the abyss) was created.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> God divided light from darkness. He also divided Heaven from Hell, once Hell was created (or became necessary due to the angels that fell from grace). Notice that God chooses to create Heaven and Earth (Universe), but Hell comes about as a result of sin. God creates Good, but Evil comes about because of sin. God does not directly create evil or darkness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The first day is not a day as we count time, but merely the first period of time, of unspecified length, in the universe. Science agrees that first the Universe was created, and there was no life in the first time period, for the Universe was void and unoccupied. And when the earth first became, it was void and lifeless.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> This verse introduces a useful ambiguity, whereby the word ‘terra’ can refer to the entire Earth, or to the land (soil or ground), or to a particular land, e.g. ‘Terram Chanaan.’ A similar ambiguity exists with the word ‘caeli’ referring either to Heaven, or to the sky.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> Notice that God commands the earth to produce plant-life (‘herbam virentem’). He miraculously created heaven and earth out of nothing, but he causes the plant-life to be produced out of what already exists, the land. This text supports the idea, found in science, that life developed from existing inanimate matter. But the text also clearly teaches the truth that the entire process of creation and the development of creation is caused by God and is under His Providence.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-8' href='#cpdv-verse-1-8'>h</a>. <span> The word ‘genus’ from verse 11 is more general than the word ‘speciem’ in verse 12. The fruit-bearing trees have their seed within the fruit, and each particular type of fruit has its own type of seed and manner of sowing.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-9' href='#cpdv-verse-1-9'>i</a>. <span> In this next step within the development of creation, God creates the first creatures that have living souls (but not immortal souls) within the sea. Again, science agrees, teaching that the first animals were in the water, not on the land. The word ‘reptile’ in Latin is not equivalent to the English word ‘reptile.’ The best translation in this context is probably either ‘moving creatures’ or ‘animals.’ The text is contrasting the moving creatures of the waters with the plants.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-10' href='#cpdv-verse-1-10'>j</a>. <span> The word ‘cete’ in ancient times was probably not specific to whales, but referred to any large sea creature.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-11' href='#cpdv-verse-1-11'>k</a>. <span> Again, the word ‘genere’ is more general, while the word ‘species’ is more specific. If these two words were translated by the same word in English, then there would be an unnecessary redundancy in the text. And here again we see that ‘reptile’ is not specifically reptiles, or even crawling things, but is even more general, referring to every type of moving creature (animal) on land. These creatures are contrasted with the moving creatures of the waters, as well as the plants, of the previous verses. Therefore, the term is more general than crawling things. The mention of cattle and wild beasts are merely specific examples of familiar types of moving creatures, with living souls, on land.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-12' href='#cpdv-verse-1-12'>l</a>. <span> So, plants were the first life created, then moving creatures of the sea, then moving creatures of the land. This is the same order of development in creation taught by science (although Scripture omits mention of microscopic organisms, with which the ancients were unfamiliar).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-13' href='#cpdv-verse-1-13'>m</a>. <span> The word ‘hominem’ in this verse is not capitalized, whereas in the previous verse it is capitalized. The previous verse uses Man (capitalized) to refer to all humankind; the male word ‘man’ is used to refer to all of humanity because, in God’s plan, the human race is to be led by men. This verse uses man (not capitalized) to refer to humankind, with a particular emphasis on males. All human persons are created in God’s image and likeness. Yet, when men and women are considered in their relation to one another, men are an image of God and women are an image of Creation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And from the soil the Lord God produced every tree that was beautiful to behold and pleasant to eat. And even the tree of life was in the midst of Paradise, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And a river went forth from the place of enjoyment so as to irrigate Paradise, which is divided from there into four heads.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the name of the second river is the Gehon; it is that which runs through all the land of Ethiopia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Truly, the name of the third river is the Tigris; it advances opposite the Assyrians. But the fourth river, it is the Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Thus, the Lord God brought the man, and put him into the Paradise of enjoyment, so that it would be attended and preserved by him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he instructed him, saying: “From every tree of Paradise, you shall eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat. For in whatever day you will eat from it, you will die a death.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The Lord God also said: “It is not good for the man to be alone. Let us make a helper for him similar to himself.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Therefore, the Lord God, having formed from the soil all the animals of the earth and all the flying creatures of the air, brought them to Adam, in order to see what he would call them.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Adam called each of the living things by their names: all the flying creatures of the air, and all the wild beasts of the land. Yet truly, for Adam, there was not found a helper similar to himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so the Lord God sent a deep sleep upon Adam. And when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and he completed it with flesh for it.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> In other words, this was the time before agriculture, when the trees and plants were wild and not yet cultivated.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> Augustine and others say that this passage refers to the lineages of Seth and Cain, the one being holy and close to God, and the other living apart from God. My suggestion is a more generalized version of what Augustine said, namely, that the sons of God are those who stayed close to God in their lives, and the sons of men are those who lived merely secular lives. In the Bible, the term 'sons of' does not necessarily connotate lineage. For example, those who commit adultery are called, 'sons of adulterers,' not because their parents were also adulterers, but because they act as if they were sons of adultery personified. There were, in ancient times, prior to any organized religion as we have today, some who were holy, who lived close to God, and who, as a result, lived long lives. But these sons of God were attracted to women who were not holy, who lived secular lives. Thus God generally limits the length of our lives because of sin.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> The giants were perhaps those who were giants in their mental stature, not so much in their physical stature. There may also have been stark differences in the physical characteristics of different groups of people, due to small gene pools, in groups separated by tribe or lineage. Some groups may have been markedly larger or stronger than others. The sons of the sons of God and the daughters of men were mighty because God blesses the offspring of those who are holy.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘requiram’ has more the sense of ‘examine,’ than of ‘require,’ especially in this context. The repetition of the word man, using both ‘hominis’ and ‘viri,’ indicates that the first usage applies to mankind.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-3' href='#cpdv-verse-9-3'>c</a>. <span> God tells mankind not only to ‘replete’ (fill) the earth, as the animals do, but also to ‘implete’ (fulfill or complete) the earth, as only mankind can do.</span></div>

In the context of the phrase ‘vir agricola,’ the word vir, though a noun, has more of the effect of an adjective: ‘a good farmer.’</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-1' href='#cpdv-verse-18-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘adoravit’ in Latin does not always refer to adoration; it can also refer to treating someone with reverence or respect.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-2' href='#cpdv-verse-18-2'>b</a>. <span> Because ‘lavate’ and ‘requiescite’ are imperative, it implies that the washing of the feet will be done by the visitors, not by Abram. Otherwise, the verb would have been indicative first person singular.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-3' href='#cpdv-verse-18-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘sata’ refers to something that is cultivated, as opposed to grain that is wild. There is also a strong implication that it was cultivated locally, that is, by the servants of Abraham; it was not bought, but home-grown. This could be translated as ‘home-grown wheat flour,’ but it is usually translated as ‘the finest wheat flour,’ since wheat has a strong symbolic connection to the Eucharist, the finest Sacrament.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-4' href='#cpdv-verse-18-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘subcinericios’ probably refers to an ancient type of heat retention cooking, where loaves were placed under the ashes of a fire to bake.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-5' href='#cpdv-verse-18-5'>e</a>. <span> The phrase ‘vita comite’ literally means ‘with life as a companion.’ Wycliffe translates this as ‘if I live.’ But other translations see it as referring to the time of his return, the springtime. The phrase, in this context, has a dual meaning. It refers to the springtime: life springing up when he returns, as if his companion. It also refers to the life in Sarah’s womb, for this new life’s birth will coincide with his return.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-6' href='#cpdv-verse-18-6'>f</a>. <span> The Douay-Rheims versions have ‘I shall return,’ but the text says ‘he shall return,’ using the third person singular.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-7' href='#cpdv-verse-18-7'>g</a>. <span> Scripture is explaining God’s actions in human terms, as a figure of speech, because it is difficult to describe or even imagine the fullness of Eternity and Knowledge found in God. Scripture is not saying that God could not know without going down to investigate.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-18-8' href='#cpdv-verse-18-8'>h</a>. <span> Abraham traveled, but he still was, in a manner of speaking always standing in front of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>“Cast out this woman servant and her son. For the son of a woman servant will not be heir with my son Isaac.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Abraham took this grievously, for the sake of his son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And God said to him: “Let it not seem harsh to you concerning the boy and your woman servant. In all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be invoked in Isaac.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Yet I will also make the son of the woman servant into a great nation, for he is your offspring.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And so Abraham arose in the morning, and taking bread and a skin of water, he placed it upon her shoulder, and he handed over the boy, and he released her. And when she had departed, she wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the water in the skin had been consumed, she set aside the boy, under one of the trees that were there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she moved away and sat in a distant area, as far as a bow can reach. For she said, “I shall not see the boy die.” And so, sitting opposite her, he lifted up his voice and wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But God heard the voice of the boy. And an Angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, saying: “What are you doing, Hagar? Do not be afraid. For God has heeded the voice of the boy, from the place where he is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-642'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Rise up. Take the boy and hold him by the hand. For I will make of him a great nation.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-643'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And God opened her eyes. And seeing a well of water, she went and filled the skin, and she gave the boy to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And God was with him. And he grew, and he stayed in the wilderness, and he became a young man, an archer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And he lived in the desert of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>At the same time, Abimelech and Phicol, the leader of his army, said to Abraham: “God is with you in everything that you do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Therefore, swear by God that you will do no harm to me, and to my posterity, and to my stock.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Abraham said, “I will swear.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-649'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Abimelech responded, “I do not know who did this thing, but you also did not reveal it to me, nor have I heard of it, before today.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And so Abraham took sheep and oxen, and he gave them to Abimelech. And both of them struck a pact.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And Abraham set aside seven female lambs from the flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Abimelech said to him, “What purpose have these seven female lambs, which you have caused to stand separately?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But he said, “You will receive seven female lambs from my hand, so that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>For this reason, that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them did swear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they initiated a pact on behalf of the well of oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-657'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Abimelech and Phicol, the leader of his army, rose up, and they returned to the land of the Palestinians.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-658'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he was a settler in the land of the Palestinians for many days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-661'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things occurred, God tested Abraham, and he said to him, “Abraham, Abraham.” And he answered, “Here I am.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-662'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He said to him: “Take your only begotten son Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of vision. And there you shall offer him as a holocaust upon one of the mountains, which I will show to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-663'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so Abraham, getting up in the night, harnessed his donkey, taking with him two youths, and his son Isaac. And when he had cut wood for the holocaust, he traveled toward the place, as God had instructed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-664'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then, on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place at a distance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-666'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He also took the wood for the holocaust, and he imposed it upon his son Isaac. And he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as the two continued on together,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-667'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Isaac said to his father, “My father.” And he answered, “What do you want, son?” “Behold,” he said, “fire and wood. Where is the victim for the holocaust?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-668'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Abraham said, “God himself will provide the victim for the holocaust, my son.” Thus they continued on together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-669'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And they came to the place that God had shown to him. There he built an altar, and he set the wood in order upon it. And when he had bound his son Isaac, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-670'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he reached out his hand and took hold of the sword, in order to sacrifice his son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-671'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And behold, an Angel of the Lord called out from heaven, saying, “Abraham, Abraham.” And he answered, “Here I am.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-672'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Do not extend your hand over the boy, and do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, since you have not spared your only begotten son for my sake.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-673'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and he saw behind his back a ram among the thorns, caught by the horns, which he took and offered as a holocaust, instead of his son.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-675'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the Angel of the Lord called out to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he was questioned by the men of that place about his wife, he answered, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to confess her to be his mate, thinking that perhaps they would put him to death because of her beauty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when very many days had passed, and he had remained in the same place, Abimelech, king of the Palestinians, gazing through a window, saw him being playful with Rebekah, his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And summoning him, he said: “It is clear that she is your wife. Why did you falsely claim her to be your sister?” He answered, “I was afraid, lest I might die because of her.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Abimelech said: “Why have you burdened us? Someone from the people could have lain with your wife, and you would have brought a great sin upon us.” And he instructed all the people, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and he found, in that same year, one hundredfold. And the Lord blessed him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Likewise, he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very large family. Because of this, the Palestinians envied him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And departing, he then went toward the torrent of Gerar, and he dwelt there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then they dug up yet another one. And over that one also they fought, and he called it, ‘Enmity.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-863'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>she said to her son Jacob: “I heard your father speaking with your brother Esau, and saying to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-864'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>‘Bring to me from your hunting, and make me foods, so that I may eat and bless you in the sight of the Lord before I die.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-865'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, now my son, agree to my counsel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and go straight to the flock, and bring me two of the best young goats, so that from them I may make meat for your father, such as he willingly eats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then, when you have brought these in and he has eaten, he may bless you before he dies.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-868'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He answered her: “You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am smooth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-869'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>If my father should lay hands on me and perceive it, I am afraid lest he think me willing to mock him, and I will bring a curse upon myself, instead of a blessing.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-870'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And his mother said to him: “Let this curse be upon me, my son. Yet listen to my voice, and go directly to bring what I said.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-871'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He went out, and he brought, and he gave to his mother. She prepared the meats, just as she knew his father liked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-872'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And she clothed him with the very fine garments of Esau, which she had at home with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-873'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she encircled his hands with little pelts from the young goats, and she covered his bare neck.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-874'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And she gave him the small meal, and she handed him the bread that she had baked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-875'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When he had carried these in, he said, “My father?” And he answered, “I’m listening. Who are you, my son?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-876'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Jacob said: “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you instructed me. Arise; sit and eat from my hunting, so that your soul may bless me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-877'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And again Isaac said to his son, “How were you able to find it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “It was the will of God, so that what I sought met with me quickly.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-878'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Isaac said, “Come here, so that I may touch you, my son, and may prove whether you are my son Esau, or not.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-879'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He approached his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: “The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob. But the hands are the hands of Esau.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-880'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he did not recognize him, because his hairy hands made him seem similar to the elder one. Therefore, blessing him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-881'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>he said, “Are you my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-882'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then he said, “Bring me the foods from your hunting, my son, so that my soul may bless you.” And when he had eaten what was offered, he also brought forth wine for him. And after he finished it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-883'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>he said to him, “Come to me and give me a kiss, my son.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-884'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He approached and kissed him. And immediately he perceived the fragrance of his garments. And so, blessing him, he said: “Behold, the smell of my son is like the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord has blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-885'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>May God give to you, from the dew of heaven and from the fatness of the earth, an abundance of grain and wine.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-887'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Scarcely had Isaac completed his words, and Jacob departed, when Esau arrived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-888'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And he brought his father foods cooked from his hunting, saying, “Arise, my father, and eat from your son’s hunting, so that your soul may bless me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-889'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And Isaac said to him, “But who are you?” And he answered, “I am your firstborn son, Esau.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-890'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Isaac became frightened and very astonished. And wondering beyond what can be believed, he said: “Then who is he that a while ago brought me the prey from his hunting, from which I ate, before you arrived? And I blessed him, and he will be blessed.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-891'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Esau, having heard his father’s words, roared out with a great outcry. And, being confounded, he said, “But bless me also, my father.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-892'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And he said, “Your twin came deceitfully, and he received your blessing.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-893'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>But he responded: “Justly is his name called Jacob. For he has supplanted me yet another time. My birthright he took away before, and now, this second time, he has stolen my blessing.” And again, he said to his father, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me also?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-894'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Isaac answered: “I have appointed him as your lord, and I have subjugated all his brothers as his servants. I have reinforced him with grain and wine, and after this, my son, what more shall I do for you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-895'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Esau said to him: “Have you only one blessing, father? I beg you, bless me also.” And when he wept with a loud wail,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-896'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Isaac was moved, and he said to him: “In the fatness of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-897'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>will your blessing be. You will live by the sword, and you will serve your brother. But the time will arrive when you will shake off and release his yoke from your neck.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-898'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Therefore, Esau always hated Jacob, for the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And he said in his heart, “The days will arrive for the mourning of my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-899'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>These things were reported to Rebekah. And sending and calling for her son Jacob, she said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau is threatening to kill you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-900'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Therefore, now my son, listen to my voice. Rise up and flee to my brother Laban, in Haran.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-901'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And you will dwell with him for a few days, until the fury of your brother subsides,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-903'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob accepts a wife from the stock of this land, I would not be willing to live.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-1' href='#cpdv-verse-31-1'>a</a>. <span> The Angel says, ‘I am the God of Bethel....’ because the Angel was sent to convey God’s words to Jacob. In ancient times, when one wanted to convey a message to someone, one would send another person, usually a youth, to that someone to repeat your words to them. So it made perfect sense to Jacob that God would send an Angel (a messenger of God) convey a message by repeating God’s words to Jacob.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-2' href='#cpdv-verse-31-2'>b</a>. <span> Here is a verse whereby the Bible comments on its own translation, permitting an event to be described with varied wording, as best fits the language into which it is translated. Also, note that what each one chooses to call it reveals his attitude towards the agreement. Laban’s ‘tumulum’ can be translated as ‘tomb’ (cf. Job 10:19). Laban was losing his daughters, flocks, and son-in-law (a valuable employee); this loss was like a kind of death to him. But Jacob thought little of this agreement, for it was merely an agreement to let him have what was already justly his. So he calls it ‘acervum,’ which means ‘little hill’ or ‘pile’ or ‘heap.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-31-3' href='#cpdv-verse-31-3'>c</a>. <span> The verb ‘respicit’ does not merely mean ‘to see.’ It means to see and understand, or to look with the intention of understanding. And the word ‘praesens’ is the word ‘sens’ (a form of the verb ‘to be’) and the prefix ‘prae’ which means ‘before.’ As a phrase taken as a whole, and in this context, ‘præsens respicit’ means to understand beforehand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1079'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Likewise, Jacob continued on the journey that he had begun. And the Angels of God met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1080'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When he had seen them, he said, “These are the Encampments of God.” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, ‘Encampments.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1081'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then he also sent messengers before him to his brother Esau, in the land of Seir, in the region of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1082'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he instructed them, saying: “You shall speak in this way to my lord Esau: ‘Your brother Jacob says these things: “I have sojourned with Laban, and I have been with him until the present day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1083'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I have oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, and men servants, and women servants. And now I send an ambassador to my lord, so that I may find favor in your sight.” ’ ”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1085'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jacob was very afraid. And in his terror, he divided the people who were with him, likewise the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1086'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>saying: “If Esau goes to one company, and strikes it, the other company, which is left behind, will be saved.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1087'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Jacob said: “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord who said to me: ‘Return to your land, and to the place of your nativity, and I will do well for you.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1088'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I am less than any of your compassions and your truth, which you have fulfilled to your servant. With my staff I crossed over this Jordan. And now I go back with two companies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1089'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am very afraid of him, lest perhaps he may come and strike down the mother with the sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1090'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>You did say that you would do well by me, and that you would expand my offspring like the sand of the sea, which, because of its multitude, cannot be numbered.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1091'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when he had slept there that night, he separated, from the things that he had, gifts for his brother Esau:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1092'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1093'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>thirty milking camels with their young, forty cows, and twenty bulls, twenty she-donkeys, and ten of their young.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1094'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he sent them by the hands of his servants, each flock separately, and he said to his servants: “Pass before me, and let there be a space between flock and flock.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1095'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he instructed the first, saying: “If you happen to meet my brother Esau, and he questions you: “Whose are you?” or, “Where are you going?” or, “Whose are these which follow you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1096'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>you shall respond: “Your servant Jacob’s. He has sent them as a gift to my lord Esau. And he is also coming after us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1097'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Similarly, he gave orders to the second, and the third, and to all who followed the flocks, saying: “Speak these same words to Esau, when you find him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1098'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And you will add: ‘Your servant Jacob himself also follows after us, for he said: “I will appease him with the gifts that go ahead, and after this, I will see him; perhaps he will be gracious to me.” ’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1099'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And so the gifts went before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1100'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when he had arisen early, he took his two wives, and the same number of handmaids, with his eleven sons, and he crossed over the ford of Jabbok.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1101'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And having delivered over all the things that belonged to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1102'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>he remained alone. And behold, a man wrestled with him until morning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1103'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And when he saw that he would not be able to overcome him, he touched the nerve of his thigh, and immediately it withered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1104'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And he said to him, “Release me, for now the dawn ascends.” He responded, “I will not release you, unless you bless me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1105'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore he said, “What is your name?” He answered, “Jacob.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1106'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But he said, “Your name will not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if you have been strong against God, how much more will you prevail against men?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1107'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jacob questioned him, “Tell me, by what name are you called?” He responded, “Why do you ask my name?” And he blessed him in the same place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1108'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, “I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1109'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he had crossed beyond Peniel. Yet in truth, he limped on his foot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1110'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>For this reason, the sons of Israel, even to the present day, do not eat the nerve that withered in Jacob’s thigh, because he touched the nerve of his thigh and it was obstructed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1113'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Jacob, lifting up his eyes, saw Esau arriving, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the sons of Leah and Rachel, and of both the handmaids.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1114'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he placed the two handmaids and their children at the beginning. Truly, Leah and her sons were in the second place. Then Rachel and Joseph were last.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1115'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And advancing, he reverenced prostrate on the ground seven times, until his brother approached.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1116'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so Esau ran to meet his brother, and he embraced him. And drawing him by his neck and kissing him, he wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1117'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their little ones, and he said: “What do these want for themselves?” and “Are they related to you?” He responded, “These are the little ones that God has given as a gift to me, your servant.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1120'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Likewise Leah, with her sons, came near. And when they had reverenced similarly, last of all, Joseph and Rachel reverenced.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1124'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and take the blessing which I have brought to you, and which God, who bestows all things, has given as a gift to me.” Accepting it reluctantly, at the insistence of his brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1125'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>he said, “Let us go on together, and I will accompany you on your journey.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1148'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father with deceit, being enraged at the rape of their sister:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1313'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But when she was led out to the punishment, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: “I conceived by the man to whom these things belong. Recognize whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1314'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But he, acknowledging the gifts, said: “She is more just than I am. For I did not deliver her to my son Shelah.” However, he knew her no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1315'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then, at the moment of birth, there appeared twins in the womb. And so, in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, on which the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1317'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>But in truth, drawing back his hand, the other came out. And the woman said, “Why is the partition divided for you?” And for this reason, she called his name Perez.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1354'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>They responded, “We have seen a dream, and there is no one to interpret it for us.” And Joseph said to them, “Doesn’t interpretation belong to God? Recount for me what you have seen.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1355'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The chief cupbearer explained his dream first. “I saw before me a vine,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1358'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Joseph responded: “This is the interpretation of the dream. The three shoots are the next three days,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1359'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>after which Pharaoh will remember your service, and he will restore you to your former position. And you will give him the cup according to your office, as you were accustomed to do before.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1377'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Likewise, other ears of grain, of the same number, rose up, thin and struck with blight,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1379'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and when morning arrived, being terrified with fear, sent to all the interpreters of Egypt and to all of the wise men.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1380'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then at last the chief cupbearer, remembering, said, “I confess my sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1381'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The king, being angry with his servants, ordered me and the chief miller of grain to be forced into the prison of the leader of the military.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1382'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>There, in one night, both of us saw a dream presaging the future.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1383'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In that place, there was a Hebrew, a servant of the same commander of the military, to whom we explained our dreams.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1385'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Immediately, by the king’s authority, Joseph was led out of prison, and they shaved him. And changing his apparel, they presented him to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1390'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And behold, there followed after these, another seven cows, with such deformity and emaciation as I had never seen in the land of Egypt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1416'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And he changed his name and called him, in the Egyptian tongue: ‘Savior of the world.’ And he gave him as a wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1417'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood in the sight of king Pharaoh.) And he traveled throughout the regions of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1418'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And the fertility of the seven years arrived. And when the grain fields were reduced to sheaves, these were gathered into the storehouses of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1419'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And now all the abundance of grain was stored away in every city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1420'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And there was such a great abundance of wheat that it was comparable to the sands of the sea, and its bounty exceeded all measure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1421'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then, before the famine arrived, Joseph had two sons born, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, bore for him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1431'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Jacob, hearing that food was being sold in Egypt, said to his sons: “Why are you negligent?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1432'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I have heard that wheat is being sold in Egypt. Go down and buy necessities for us, so that we may be able to live, and not be consumed by destitution.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1433'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And so, when ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain in Egypt,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1435'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they entered into the land of Egypt with the others who traveled to buy. For the famine was in the land of Canaan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1436'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and grain was sold under his direction to the people. And when his brothers had reverenced him</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1437'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and he had recognized them, he spoke harshly, as if to foreigners, questioning them: “Where did you come from?” And they responded, “From the land of Canaan, to buy necessary provisions.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1438'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And although he knew his brothers, he was not known by them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1439'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And remembering the dreams, which he had seen in another time, he said to them: “You are scouts. You have come in order to see which parts of the land are weaker.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1440'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they said: “It is not so, my lord. But your servants have arrived in order to buy food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1441'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>We are all sons of one man. We have come in peace, nor do any of your subjects devise evil.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1442'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he answered them: “It is otherwise. You have come to examine the unguarded parts of this land.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1443'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But they said: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is with our father; the other is not living.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1444'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He said: “This is just as I have said. You are scouts.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1447'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, he delivered them into custody for three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1448'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then, on the third day, he brought them out of prison, and he said: “Do as I have said, and you will live. For I fear God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1449'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If you are peaceful, let one of your brothers be bound in prison. Then you may go away and carry the grain that you have bought to your houses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1450'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may be able to test your words, and you may not die.” They did as he had said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1451'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and they spoke to one another: “We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he begged us and we would not listen.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1452'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Reuben, one of them, said: “Did not I say to you, ‘Do not sin against the boy,’ and you would not listen to me? See, his blood is exacted.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1453'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But they did not know that Joseph understood, because he was speaking to them through an interpreter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1454'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And he turned himself away briefly and wept. And returning, he spoke to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1455'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he ordered his ministers to fill their sacks with wheat, and to replace each one’s money in their sacks, and to give them, in addition, provisions for the way.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1456'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then, having loaded their donkeys with the grain, they set out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1457'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And one of them, opening a sack to give his beast of burden fodder at the inn, looked upon the money at the sack’s mouth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1458'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>and he said to his brothers: “My money has returned to me. See, it is held in the sack.” And they were astonished and troubled, and they said to one another, “What is this that God has done to us?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1459'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And they went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, and they explained to him all the things that had befallen them, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1460'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>“The lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and he considered us to be scouts of the province.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1461'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And we answered him: ‘We are peaceful, and we do not intend any treachery.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1462'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>We are twelve brothers conceived of one father. One is not living; the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan.’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1463'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And he said to us: ‘Thus will I prove that you are peaceful. Release one of your brothers to me, and take necessary provisions for your houses, and go away,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1464'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>and bring your youngest brother to me, so that I may know that you are not scouts. And this one, who is held in chains, you may be able to receive again. And thereafter, you shall have permission to buy what you want.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1465'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Having said this, when they poured out their grain, each found his money tied to the mouth of his sack. And all were terrified together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1466'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Their father Jacob said, “You have caused me to be without children. Joseph is not living, Simeon is held in chains, and Benjamin you would carry away. All these evils have fallen back upon me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1467'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And Reuben answered him, “Put my two sons to death, if I do not lead him back to you. Deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1468'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But he said: “My son will not go down with you. His brother is dead, and he is left alone.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1473'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And having consumed the provisions that they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Return and buy us a little food.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1474'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Judah answered: “The man himself declared to us, under the attestation of an oath, saying: ‘You will not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.’</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1477'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Israel said to them, “You have done this for my misery, in that you revealed to him that you also had another brother.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1478'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But they responded: “The man questioned us in order, concerning our family: whether our father lived, if we had a brother.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1479'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Likewise, Judah said to his father: “Send the boy with me, so that we may set out and be able to live, lest we and our little ones should die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1480'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I accept the boy; require him at my hand. Unless I lead him back and restore him to you, I will be guilty of a sin against you for all time.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1496'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And having led them into the house, he brought water, and they washed their feet, and he gave fodder to their donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1497'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But they also prepared the gifts, until Joseph entered at midday. For they had heard that they would eat bread there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1499'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But he, gently greeting them again, questioned them, saying: “Is your father, the old man about whom you spoke to me, in good health? Is he still alive?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1500'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And they answered: “Your servant, our father, is safe; he is still alive.” And bowing, they reverenced him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1501'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then Joseph, lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother of the same womb, and he said, “Is this your little brother, about whom you spoke to me?” And again, he said, “May God be compassionate to you, my son.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1502'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And he hurried out, because his heart had been moved over his brother, and tears gushed out. And going into his chamber, he wept.</span></div>

Ordinarily, they would save some seed from one crop in order to grow the next crop. But the famine was caused by an inability to grow crops, almost certainly due to a lack of rain. This drought would reduce the amount of crops that could be grown to the extent that they could not (or would not) save some seed for the next crop. The drought would also keep the Nile from flooding its banks (which would have provided water and rich soil for crops grown in the flood plain).</span></div>

It describes the state of the twelve parts of the one Catholic Church prior to the Return of Christ. Currently, the Church as two parts, east and west. After the unification of all the Christian Churches in one Catholic Church (in the early 2020’s), there will be seven parts within the one Church. Much later, these seven will become twelve parts of one Church, like the twelve tribes of Israel. It is these twelve tribes of the future Church that Jacob describes on his death bed.</span></div>
