<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1158-37-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father’s wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1159-37-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1260-40-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1277-41-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1278-41-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1279-41-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and leanfleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1280-41-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1281-41-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1282-41-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1283-41-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1284-41-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1285-41-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1286-41-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1287-41-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1288-41-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1289-41-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1290-41-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Forthwith at the king’s command, Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him, and changing his apparel, brought him in to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1291-41-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1301-41-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Joseph answered: The king’s dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1302-41-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1307-41-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1308-41-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1309-41-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1310-41-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1311-41-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up under Pharao’s hands, and be reserved in the cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1312-41-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1313-41-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1314-41-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1315-41-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1317-41-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1318-41-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1319-41-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1320-41-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1321-41-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue, The saviour of the world.

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1322-41-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao) and he went round all the countries of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1323-41-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1324-41-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1325-41-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1326-41-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis bore unto him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1328-41-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-1329-41-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were past:</span></div>
