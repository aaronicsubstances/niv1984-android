<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> The word ‘interficere’ means to execute or to put to death, in the sense of a death sentence by one in authority, not in the sense of killing in the streets.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The phrase ‘iniquitatem terræ civitatis’ refers to the iniquity of the community of earth. The word ‘civitatis’ does not always refer to a particular city; it can also refer to a larger community, in this case the whole world. The context of the whole world is made clear in the previous verses, that refer to ‘all nations’ and ‘all peoples.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> This translation eschews the so-called ‘inclusive language’ approach to translation. However, in this verse, it would be misleading to choose between ‘he’ and ‘she’ for the pronouns as the meaning of the text clearly applies to both or either genders. Thus, the word ‘their’ is used in the singular.</span></div>
