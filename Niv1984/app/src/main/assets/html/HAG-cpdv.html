<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the second year of king Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came, by the hand of Haggai the prophet, to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Jesus the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: This people claims that the time has not yet arrived for building the house of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Is it time for you to dwell in paneled houses, while this house is deserted?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now, thus says the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You sowed much and have brought in little. You consumed and have not been satisfied. You drank and have not been inebriated. You covered yourselves and have not been warmed. And whoever gathered wages, has put them in a bag with holes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thus says the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Ascend to the mountain, bring wood and build the house, and it shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>You have looked for more, and behold, it became less, and you brought it home, and I blew it away. What is the cause of this, says the Lord of hosts? It is because my house is desolate, yet you have hurried, each one to his own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Because of this, the heavens over you have been prohibited from giving dew, and the earth has been prohibited from giving her sprouts.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-3" id="cpdv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And I called a drought over the land, and over the mountains, and over the wheat, and over the wine, and over the oil, and whatever the soil would bring forth, and over men, and over beasts of burden, and over all the labor of hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jesus the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people heeded the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, just as the Lord their God sent him to them. And the people were fearful before the face of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-4" id="cpdv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Haggai, a messenger of the Lord among messengers of the Lord, spoke to the people, saying: the Lord says, “I am with you.”</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-5" id="cpdv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the Lord stirred the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the remainder of all the people. And they entered and performed work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Haggai the prophet actually wrote down his prophecies, in some form. Other prophets did not write (and may have been illiterate); other persons wrote down their prophecies, which they had merely spoken.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The expression ‘you drank and have not been inebriated’ is a figure of speech.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘germen’ refers to germination or sprouts or shoots, in other words, the first part of the plant to spring forth from the soil. Thus, the sky does not produce dew and the earth does not even begin to produce plants.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The name of the high priest, in Latin, is ‘Jesus,’ therefore, the translation as ‘Jesus,’ is justified. Some other translations obscure this connection between this man’s name and our Lord’s name, by translating the name as ‘Joshua.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> The phrases ‘song of songs’ and ‘a man among men’ and ‘blessed are you among women’ are all examples of a way of indicating a superlative. Haggai was ‘a messenger among messengers.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> This passage foreshadows the time when the Church will rebuild the Vatican. The Vatican, having been destroyed during World War 3, will not be rebuilt until the second year of the reign of the great monarch. God will stir the spirit of the great monarch and the spirit of the Pope. And so work on the rebuilding of the Vatican in Rome (the center of authority in the Church), and work on the building of a chief Church in Jerusalem, (the center of worship for the Church) will begin when the first part of the tribulation ends.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase ‘vigesima et prima mensis’ is not found in translation in the version of the Challoner Douay-Rheims used as a guide in this translation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The Desired of all nations is the Christ, the Messiah. The words ET VENIET DESIDERATUS are in all capital letters in some editions of the Vulgate.</span></div>

The foundations of the Church include the Word of God, which is uttered by God, as well as Tradition and the teachings of the Magisterium, each of can be said to be uttered by God. Also, the Church itself is an image of Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. The Second Person can be said to be uttered by the First Person within the Trinity.</span></div>
