<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You made him a little </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> the sins of the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38-3-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-3-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60-4-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62-4-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68-4-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71-4-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72-4-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-5" id="niv-verse-4-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116-7-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117-7-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118-7-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119-7-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120-7-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121-7-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122-7-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123-7-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124-7-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125-7-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126-7-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128-7-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160-9-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161-9-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163-9-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164-9-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165-9-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167-9-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168-9-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173-9-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-3" id="niv-verse-9-3">c</a>]</sup><span> so that we may serve the living God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174-9-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182-9-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183-9-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185-9-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span></div>
