The word palliola could be translated as little hood, or little cape, but in the context of modern clothing, short skirt is probably more applicable. The word ‘acus’ refers to a long needle used to make embroidered cloth; a similar pin was also used in women’s hair.

The phrase “in cornu filio olei” is correctly translated in the original Douai version, and also in the Wycliffe translation: “in the horn in the son of oil”. At first glace, this translation might not seem to make sense. But the word ‘horn’ was used to describe an area of land (perhaps irregularly shaped) that would be at the extremity of a larger parcel of land. It might be a raised area, since higher ground is better for growing plants (in that it drains well and warms quickly). This vineyard belonged to the father’s brother’s son, so it would have been divided to him from out of a larger parcel. So which part of the larger area of land was he given? It was a choice area, which was termed ‘the son of oil,’ in other words, the most productive part of the vineyard.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-2' href='#cpdv-verse-5-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘labruscas’ refers not so much to wild grapes, but to wild grape vines, which would be much less productive than the domesticated vines selected and bred for productivity.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-30-2' href='#cpdv-verse-30-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrase ‘panem arctum, et aquam brevem’ does not mean that the Lord will give too little bread and water. Note the context of the previous verse, where God says He will answer prayers promptly. So he would not next say that no one will have enough bread or water. The word ‘arctum’ means thick, and the idea of thick bread (a very full robust bread that is full of nutrition) fits the context of a time of God’s favor. The word ‘brevem’ does not mean too little water, but rather, readily available water, which can be obtained in a short time.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-794'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, in that broken staff of a reed. But if a man were to lean against it, it would enter his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-795'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But if you answer me by saying: ‘We trust in the Lord our God.’ Is it not his high places and altars that Hezekiah has taken away?

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-799'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Eliakim, and Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh: “Speak to your servants in the Syrian language.
