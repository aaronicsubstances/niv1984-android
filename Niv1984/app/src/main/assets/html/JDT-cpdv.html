<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Thereafter, in the twelfth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Nineveh the great city, fought against Arphaxad and prevailed over him:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar was exalted, and his heart was elevated. And he sent to all who dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Lebanon,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>To all these, Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, sent messengers:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>whom they all with one mind contradicted, and they sent them back empty, and they rejected them without honor.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In fact, he took up gold and silver from the house of the king in great abundance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he set out, he and all the army, with the four-horse chariots, and horsemen, and archers. And they covered the face of the earth like locusts.</span></div>

His defeat of the kind of the Medes is a foreshadowing of the Antichrist’s defeat of the Christian king of the South, just prior to taking over the whole world. Nebuchadnezzar’s defeat of the other regions, and they subsequent willing submission to him represents the Antichrist’s defeat of two more kings after the king of the South and then the willing submission of the other world leaders to him thereafter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But when they had ceased speaking, it happened that Holofernes, being very indignant, said to Achior:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>“Because you have prophesied to us, saying that the people of Israel may be defended by their God, and so as to reveal to you that there is no God, except Nebuchadnezzar:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>when we will have struck them all as one man, then you also will pass away with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel will perish into perdition with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And you will be shown that Nebuchadnezzar is the lord of the whole earth. And then, the sword of my army will pass through your sides, and, being stabbed, you will fall among the wounded of Israel, and you will breathe no longer, when you have been destroyed with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And furthermore, if you consider your prophecy to be true, do not let your countenance fall, and let the paleness that has taken hold of your face depart from you, if you claim that these my words cannot be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But so that you may know that you will experience these things together with them, behold, from this hour you will be associated with their people, so that, when they receive the punishment that they deserve from my sword, you will fall under the same vengeance.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Holofernes instructed his servants to apprehend Achior, and to lead him through to Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And, taking him, the servants of Holofernes traveled through the plains. But when they approached close to the mountains, the slingers of stones went forth against them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then, diverting by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior, hands and feet, to a tree, and so they abandoned him, bound with ropes, and they returned to their lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Thereafter, the sons of Israel, descending from Bethulia, came to him. Releasing him, they brought him to Bethulia. And so, standing him in the midst of the people, they interrogated him as to what event caused the Assyrians to abandon him, bound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In those days, the rulers of that place were Uzziah, the son of Micah of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris, also called Gothoniel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And so, in the midst of the elders and in the sight of everyone, Achior explained all that he had said in reply to the questioning of Holofernes, and in what manner the people of Holofernes wanted to have him killed because of this word,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and how Holofernes himself, being angry, had ordered him to be handed over to the Israelites, for this reason: so that when he would prevail over the sons of Israel, then he would also command Achior himself to be executed by diverse torments, because he had said that the God of heaven is their defender.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell on their faces, adoring the Lord, and, communing together with mourning and weeping, they poured out their prayers with one mind to the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>saying: “O Lord, God of heaven and earth, behold their arrogance, and gaze upon our humility, and attend to the face of your holy ones, and reveal that you do not abandon those who rely on you, and that those who rely on themselves and who glory in their own strength, you humble.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And so, when their weeping was ended, and the prayer of the people throughout the entire day was completed, they consoled Achior,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>saying: “The God of our fathers, whose power you have predicted, will give to you this in return: that you, instead, will see the destruction of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Truly, when the Lord our God will give this freedom to his servants, may God also be with you in our midst, so that, just as it pleases you, everyone who is with you may keep company with us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Uzziah, after the council was ended, received him into his own house, and he made him a great supper.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And all the elders were invited; together they refreshed themselves at the completion of their fast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>In truth, after this, all the people were called together, and they prayed throughout the entire night within the assembly, petitioning help from the God of Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Moreover, there were one hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and twenty-two thousand horsemen, besides the contingents of those men who had been taken captive, and all the youths who had been abducted from the provinces and the cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>All these prepared themselves together to fight against the sons of Israel, and they came through the foothills of the mountain, even to the apex, which looks down upon Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, up to Chelmon, which is opposite Esdrelon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the sons of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, scattering ashes over their heads, praying with one accord that the God of Israel would show his mercy upon his people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And, taking up their arms of war, they set up positions at the places that lead along a narrow footpath between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Holofernes, while circling around, discovered that the fountain that flowed in to them, led directly through an aqueduct on the south side, beyond the city.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Even so, there were springs not far from the walls, from which they were seen to draw water secretly, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But the sons of Ammon and Moab approached Holofernes, saying: “The sons of Israel do not trust in their lances, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defense, and the steep hills and precipices constitute their fortifications.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, so that you may be able to overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs so that they may not draw water from them, and you will put them to death without the sword, or at least, being weary, they will hand over their city, which they suppose to be, by its position in the mountains, unable to be conquered.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And these words were pleasing before Holofernes and before his attendants, and so he stationed a hundred men around every spring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when they had kept this watch through twenty full days, the cisterns and collections of waters failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia, so that there was within the city not enough to satisfy them for even one day, because water was given out to the people daily by measure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then, all the men and women, youths and little ones, gathering together before Uzziah, all with one voice together,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And therefore, there is no one to help us, while we are prostrated before their eyes with thirst and great destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And now, gather together all who are in the city, so that we may willingly deliver every one of us to the people of Holofernes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-153'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For it is better that as captives, being alive, we should bless the Lord, than that we should die and become a disgrace to all flesh, after we have seen our wives and our children die before our eyes.</span></div>

He will hide the fact that he is from the Middle East (the kingdom of the South) and he will become the king of the North (Europe).
