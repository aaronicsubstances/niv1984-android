<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And John offered testimony, saying: “For I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove; and he remained upon him.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The words 'Deus' and 'Verbum' are both in the nominative case, so the text could be read as 'God was the Word,' or as 'the Word was God.'
<br>
However, word order in Latin is not entirely irrelevant, therefore this translation prefers ‘God was the Word,’ over ‘the Word was God.’ The same translation choice is made in the original Rheims New Testament of 1582.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Deus, Verbum, Vita represents Father, Son, Spirit.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The darkness represents the fallen angels and all evil in the world, which cannot understand the light of goodness. Notice that the light shines in the present tense, which is the closest tense to the timelessness of the Eternity of God, but the darkness is spoken of using the past tense, because fallen angels are trapped in Time.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> On one level of meaning, ‘ante me factus est’ means ‘ranks ahead of me.’ But there are other levels of meaning which that translation obscures. This is a frequent translation dilemma: one translation makes one level of meaning clearer, and other levels of meaning more obscure.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> This verse (particularly the last phrase) has several levels of meaning, and is somewhat obscure. This translation does not try to clear up every obscurity in Scripture, nor does it try to decide between various levels of meaning. On one level, it means that we have received grace upon grace; on another level, it means that we need grace from Christ for everything we do, even our cooperation with grace is a grace. And it seems to me that there are other levels of meaning also.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> I believe that John originally wrote his Gospel in Aramaic, the same language that Jesus most often used to teach, and that later John’s disciples translated it into Greek and added to it. That is why there are repeated references in the text saying ‘which is translated as.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-7' href='#cpdv-verse-1-7'>g</a>. <span> He was able to perceive the truth so readily because there was no deceit in him.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘Solvite’ is not so much ‘destroy’ as it is to loosen or release or set free. Jesus is referring primarily to his own death, which is not his destruction, but the separation of his soul from his body, a kind of loosening or release.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> The length of time, 46 years, is divided into 40 plus 6 providentially. The 46 years is counted as the 46th Passover since the completion of the rebuilding of the Temple Sanctuary, which took 1.5 years. Josephus tell us that the Temple more generally, not merely the Sanctuary alone, took 8 years. Subtracting 1.5 years gives us 6.5 years: the length of time from the completion of the Sanctuary (at which time the rebuilt Temple was consecrated to God and the count of the years began) to the completion of the other buildings related to the Sanctuary. Then 40 more years are counted until Christ cleansed the temple by driving out the buyers and sellers.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> Since Jesus was referring to his body as a temple, of which the temple building is merely a symbol, this passage also refers symbolically to the length of time since the Immaculate Conception. This was now the 46th Passover since the Immaculate Conception, when God began to build the temple of Christ’s body by first building the temple of Mary’s body, in which God dwelt for 9 months (in the womb).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so, when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made more disciples and baptized more than John,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>(though Jesus himself was not baptizing, but only his disciples)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>he left behind Judea, and he traveled again to Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now he needed to cross through Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore, he went into a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the estate which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Jacob’s well was there. And so Jesus, being tired from the journey, was sitting in a certain way on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>A woman of Samaria arrived to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me to drink.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And so, that Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, are requesting a drink from me, though I am a Samaritan woman?” For the Jews do not associate with the Samaritans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus responded and said to her: “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give me to drink,’ perhaps you would have made a request of him, and he would have given you living water.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The woman said to him: “Lord, you do not have anything with which to draw water, and the well is deep. From where, then, do you have living water?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-158'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God is Spirit. And so, those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-159'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The woman said to him: “I know that the Messiah is coming (who is called the Christ). And then, when he will have arrived, he will announce everything to us.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And then his disciples arrived. And they wondered that he was speaking with the woman. Yet no one said: “What are you seeking?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-162'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And so the woman left behind her water jar and went into the city. And she said to the men there:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-164'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Therefore, they went out of the city and came to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-165'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Meanwhile, the disciples petitioned him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But he said to them, “I have food to eat which you do not know.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-167'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Therefore, the disciples said to one another, “Could someone have brought him something to eat?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus said to them: “My food is to do the will of the One who sent me, so that I may perfect his work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-174'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him, because of the word of the woman who was offering testimony: “For he told me all the things that I have done.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-175'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Therefore, when the Samaritans had come to him, they petitioned him to lodge there. And he lodged there for two days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-178'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Then, after two days, he departed from there, and he traveled into Galilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-183'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Since he had heard that Jesus came to Galilee from Judea, he sent to him and begged him to come down and heal his son. For he was beginning to die.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-193'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things, there was a feast day of the Jews, and so Jesus ascended to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-243'>John 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these things, Jesus traveled across the sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And a great multitude was following him, for they saw the signs that he was accomplishing toward those who were infirm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-246'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus went onto a mountain, and he sat down there with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-247'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now the Passover, the feast day of the Jews, was near.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-248'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And so, when Jesus had lifted up his eyes and had seen that a very great multitude came to him, he said to Philip, “From where should we buy bread, so that these may eat?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-249'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But he said this to test him. For he himself knew what he would do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-250'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii of bread would not be sufficient for each of them to receive even a little.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-251'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-252'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>“There is a certain boy here, who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are these among so many?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Jesus said, “Have the men sit down to eat.” Now, there was much grass in that place. And so the men, in number about five thousand, sat down to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-254'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus took the bread, and when he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting down to eat; similarly also, from the fish, as much as they wanted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-255'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then, when they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather the fragments that are left over, lest they be lost.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-256'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And so they gathered, and they filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which were left over from those who had eaten.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-257'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, those men, when they had seen that Jesus had accomplished a sign, they said, “Truly, this one is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-258'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And so, when he realized that they were going to come and take him away and make him king, Jesus fled back to the mountain, by himself alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-259'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then, when evening arrived, his disciples descended to the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-260'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when they had climbed into a boat, they went across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had now arrived, and Jesus had not returned to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-261'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the sea was stirred up by a great wind that was blowing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-262'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And so, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat, and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-263'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But he said to them: “It is I. Do not be afraid.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-264'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore, they were willing to receive him into the boat. But immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>On the next day, the crowd which was standing across the sea saw that there were no other small boats in that place, except one, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had departed alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Yet truly, other boats came over from Tiberias, next to the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-267'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore, when the crowd had seen that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they climbed into the small boats, and they went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-268'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And when they had found him across the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-269'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Jesus answered them and said: “Amen, amen, I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen signs, but because you have eaten from the bread and were satisfied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-270'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Do not work for food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-271'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Therefore, they said to him, “What should we do, so that we may labor in the works of God?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-272'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jesus responded and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he sent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-273'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And so they said to him: “Then what sign will you do, so that we may see it and believe in you? What will you work?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-274'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Our fathers ate manna in the desert, just as it has been written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-276'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>For the bread of God is he who descends from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-277'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And so they said to him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”</span></div>

It is used metaphorically in many instances. It can be properly translated as ‘belly’ or ‘heart’ or ‘inner self’ or ‘chest.’ In this case, the living waters that flow from Christ’s chest, flow from the wound in his side. This event is a living symbol of the graces that flow from the Sacraments.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-2' href='#cpdv-verse-7-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘Pontifices’ is the plural of ‘Pontifex,’ which means high priest. The word is used in the plural because there was one high priest, plus a former high priest who had been deposed by the Romans. But both wielded authority over the Jews, because the position of high priest was supposed to be for life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-482'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And certain Pharisees, who were with him, heard this, and they said to him, “Are we also blind?”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrasing of this last part, ‘Et abii, et lavi, et video,’ sounds as if it might have been originally spoken in Latin. Perhaps this man spoke Latin, rather than the more common Aramaic. As a blind man, he would have been considered to be blind as a punishment for sin, and would therefore be excluded from being taught by the Jewish priests. So he would not have learned much Hebrew. Being excluded, to some extent, from Jewish society, he may have favored Latin as his spoken language. His other quoted words also sound very natural in Latin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair; her brother Lazarus was sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, his sisters sent to him, saying: “Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then, upon hearing this, Jesus said to them: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Even so, after he heard that he was sick, he then still remained in the same place for two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then, after these things, he said to his disciples, “Let us go into Judea again.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, the Jews are even now seeking to stone you. And would you go there again?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Jesus responded: “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But if he walks in the nighttime, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He said these things, and after this, he said to them: “Lazarus our friend is sleeping. But I am going, so that I may awaken him from sleep.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-551'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore, Martha, when she heard that Jesus was arriving, went out to meet him. But Mary was sitting at home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-552'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And then Martha said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-559'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And when she had said these things, she went and called her sister Mary quietly, saying, “The Teacher is here, and he is calling you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When she heard this, she rose up quickly and went to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-562'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, the Jews who were with her in the house and who were consoling her, when they had seen that Mary rose up quickly and went out, they followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb, so that she may weep there.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Therefore, when Mary had arrived to where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and she said to him. “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-564'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And then, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had arrived with her weeping, he groaned in spirit and became troubled.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-568'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Therefore, the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-570'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus, again groaning from within himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone had been placed over it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-571'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him who had died, said to him, “Lord, by now it will smell, for this is the fourth day.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-575'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>When he had said these things, he cried in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-576'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And immediately, he who had been dead went forth, bound at the feet and hands with winding bands. And his face was bound with a separate cloth. Jesus said to them, “Release him and let him go.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-578'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But certain ones among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-581'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, since he was the high priest that year, said to them: “You do not understand anything.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-583'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Yet he did not say this from himself, but since he was the high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-584'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>And not only for the nation, but in order to gather together as one the children of God who have been dispersed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And they made a dinner for him there. And Martha was ministering. And truly, Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at table with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-594'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And then Mary took twelve ounces of pure spikenard ointment, very precious, and she anointed the feet of Jesus, and she wiped his feet with her hair.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-595'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was soon to betray him, said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-596'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>“Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the needy?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-597'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now he said this, not out of concern for the needy, but because he was a thief and, since he held the purse, he used to carry what was put into it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-598'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But Jesus said: “Permit her, so that she may keep it against the day of my burial.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-599'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For the poor, you have with you always. But me, you do always not have.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-600'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now a great multitude of the Jews knew that he was in that place, and so they came, not so much because of Jesus, but so that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-601'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the leaders of the priests planned to put Lazarus to death also.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then, on the next day, the great crowd that had come to the feast day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>took branches of palm trees, and they went ahead to meet him. And they were crying out: “Hosanna! Blessed is he who arrives in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Jesus found a small donkey, and he sat upon it, just as it is written:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your king arrives, sitting on the colt of a donkey.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>At first, his disciples did not realize these things. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that these things happened to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so the crowd that had been with him, when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, offered testimony.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-610'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Because of this, too, the crowd went out to meet him. For they heard that he had accomplished this sign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-611'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Therefore, the Pharisees said among themselves: “Do you see that we are accomplishing nothing? Behold, the entire world has gone after him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now there were certain Gentiles among those who went up so that they might worship on the feast day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore, these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they petitioned him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Philip went and told Andrew. Next, Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But Jesus answered them by saying: “The hour arrives when the Son of man shall be glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say? Father, save me from this hour? But it is for this reason that I came to this hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Father, glorify your name!” And then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Therefore, the crowd, which was standing near and had heard it, said that it was like thunder. Others were saying, “An Angel was speaking with him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus responded and said: “This voice came, not for my sake, but for your sakes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now is the judgment of the world. Now will the prince of this world be cast out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>(Now he said this, signifying what kind of death he would die.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The crowd answered him: “We have heard, from the law, that the Christ remains forever. And so how can you say, ‘The Son of man must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of man?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus said to them: “For a brief time, the Light is among you.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-628'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may be sons of the Light.” Jesus spoke these things, and then he went away and hid himself from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And although he had done such great signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>so that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which says: “Lord, who has believed in our hearing? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-631'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Because of this, they were not able to believe, for Isaiah said again:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-632'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>“He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, so that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted: and then I would heal them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-633'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>These things Isaiah said, when he saw his glory and was speaking about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Yet truly, many of the leaders also believed in him. But because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him, so that they would not be cast out of the synagogue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>But Jesus cried out and said: “Whoever believes in me, does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Before the feast day of the Passover, Jesus knew that the hour was approaching when he would pass from this world to the Father.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And when the meal had taken place, when the devil had now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>he rose up from the meal, and he set aside his vestments, and when he had received a towel, he wrapped it around himself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And then he came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, “Lord, would you wash my feet?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus responded and said to him: “What I am doing, you do not now understand. But you shall understand it afterward.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you will have no place with me.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-817'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Jesus had said these things, he departed with his disciples across the Torrent of Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-818'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus had frequently met with his disciples there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-824'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then again he questioned them: “Who are you seeking?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jesus responded: “I told you that I am he. Therefore, if you are seeking me, permit these others to go away.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>This was so that the word might be fulfilled, which he said, “Of those whom you have given to me, I have not lost any of them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and he struck the servant of the high priest, and he cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, Jesus said to Peter: “Set your sword into the scabbard. Should I not drink the chalice which my Father has given to me?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the cohort, and the tribune, and the attendants of the Jews apprehended Jesus and bound him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And they led him away, first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Now Caiaphas was the one who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Simon Peter was following Jesus with another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and so he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But Peter was standing outside at the entrance. Therefore, the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who was the doorkeeper, and he led in Peter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, the woman servant keeping the door said to Peter, “Are you not also among the disciples of this man?” He said, “I am not.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the servants and attendants were standing before burning coals, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was standing with them also, warming himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Jesus responded to him: “I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews meet. And I have said nothing in secret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said to them. Behold, they know these things that I have said.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then, when he had said this, one of the attendants standing nearby struck Jesus, saying: “Is this the way you answer the high priest?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jesus answered him: “If I have spoken wrongly, offer testimony about the wrong. But if I have spoken correctly, then why do you strike me?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, “Are you not also one of his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>One of the servants of the high priest (a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off) said to him, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore, again, Peter denied it. And immediately the rooster crowed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium. Now it was morning, and so they did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They responded and said to him, “If he were not an evil-doer, we would not have handed him over to you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your own law.” Then the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to execute anyone.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This was so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled, which he spoke signifying what kind of death he would die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-851'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Pilate entered the praetorium again, and he called Jesus and said to him, “You are the king of the Jews?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-852'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus responded, “Are you saying this of yourself, or have others spoken to you about me?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Pilate responded: “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Jesus responded: “My kingdom is not of this world.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-855'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And so Pilate said to him, “You are a king, then?” Jesus answered, “You are saying that I am a king.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-856'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and he said to them, “I find no case against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-857'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-858'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then they all cried out repeatedly, saying: “Not this one, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-862'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the soldiers, plaiting a crown of thorns, imposed it on his head. And they put a purple garment around him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>(Then Jesus went out, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he said to them, “Behold the man.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore, when the high priests and the attendants had seen him, they cried out, saying: “Crucify him!

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-868'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to the law, he ought to die, for he has made himself the Son of God.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-869'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Therefore, when Pilate had heard this word, he was more fearful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-870'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he entered into the praetorium again. And he said to Jesus. “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no response.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-877'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore, he then handed him over to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-943'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this, Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And he manifested himself in this way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-944'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>These were together: Simon Peter and Thomas, who is called the Twin, and Nathanael, who was from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-945'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “And we are going with you.” And they went and climbed into the ship. And in that night, they caught nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-946'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when morning arrived, Jesus stood on the shore. Yet the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-947'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to them, “Children, do you have any food?” They answered him, “No.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-948'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He said to them, “Cast the net to the right side of the ship, and you will find some.” Therefore, they cast it out, and then they were not able to draw it in, because of the multitude of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-949'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore, the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” Simon Peter, when he had heard that it was the Lord, wrapped his tunic around himself, (for he was naked) and he cast himself into the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-950'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the other disciples arrived in a boat, (for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits) dragging the net with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-951'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then, when they climbed down to the land they saw burning coals prepared, and fish already placed above them, and bread.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-963'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now he said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-969'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>This is the same disciple who offers testimony about these things, and who has written these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</span></div>

The size of the fish represents the number of souls saved: a large number.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-21-2' href='#cpdv-verse-21-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that the verb tense is active not passive. Jesus has the power, as the Son of God, to raise himself up from the dead.
