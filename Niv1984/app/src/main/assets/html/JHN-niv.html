<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232-6-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235-6-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588-12-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589-12-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593-12-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-6" id="niv-verse-12-6">f</a>]</sup><span> will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594-12-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778-18-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-779-18-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-786-18-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787-18-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797-18-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799-18-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800-18-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801-18-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802-18-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803-18-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804-18-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805-18-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808-18-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809-18-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810-18-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812-18-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813-18-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>"You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814-18-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815-18-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release `the king of the Jews'?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829-19-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830-19-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831-19-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832-19-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834-19-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835-19-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841-19-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846-19-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849-19-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863-20-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864-20-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-865-20-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866-20-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867-20-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-868-20-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-869-20-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-870-20-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-871-20-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-872-20-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the disciples went back to their homes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-873-20-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-874-20-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-878-20-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-880-20-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-881-20-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883-20-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888-20-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-896-21-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> It happened this way:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-897-21-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-898-21-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-899-21-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-900-21-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-901-21-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-902-21-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-903-21-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-904-21-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-905-21-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-906-21-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-907-21-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-908-21-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909-21-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-911-21-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912-21-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-913-21-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-914-21-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-915-21-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919-21-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920-21-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </span></div>
