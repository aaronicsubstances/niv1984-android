<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He had seven sons and three daughters,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>One day the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> also came with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>On another day the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He said:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>May darkness and deep shadow </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>May those who curse days </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, `Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The LORD said to Job:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Job answered the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I spoke once, but I have no answer-- twice, but I will say no more."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"Look at the behemoth, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-1" id="niv-verse-40-1">a</a>]</sup><span> which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>His tail </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-2" id="niv-verse-40-2">b</a>]</sup><span> sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Job replied to the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>[You asked,] `Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>["You said,] `Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes." </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-42-1" id="niv-verse-42-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and a gold ring.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so he died, old and full of years. </span></div>
