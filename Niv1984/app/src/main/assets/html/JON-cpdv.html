<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Jonah rose in order to flee from the face of the Lord to Tarshish. And he went down to Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish. And he paid its fare, and he went down into it, in order to go with them to Tarshish from the face of the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the Lord sent a great wind into the sea. And a great tempest took place in the sea, and the ship was in danger of being crushed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried out to their god. And they threw the containers that were in the ship into the sea in order to lighten it of them. And Jonah went down into the interior of the ship, and he fell into a painful deep sleep.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the helmsman approached him, and he said to him, “Why are you weighed down with sleep? Rise, call upon your God, so perhaps God will be mindful of us and we might not perish.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And a man said to his shipmate, “Come, and let us cast lots, so that we may know why this disaster is upon us.” And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they said to him: “Explain to us what is the reason that this disaster is upon us. What is your work? Which is your country? And where are you going? Or which people are you from?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him, “Why have you done this?” (For the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And they said to him, “What are we to do with you, so that the sea will cease for us?” For the sea flowed and swelled.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they took Jonah and cast him into the sea. And the sea was stilled from its fury.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Or, ‘And the word of the Lord happened to Jonah the son of Amittai....’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Why is the word ‘and’ found so frequently in the Bible? One answer is that the Latin lanuage, in Biblical times, was written with no punctuation, no spaces between the words, and no difference between capital and small letters. So the word ‘and’ (in Latin ‘et’) as well as other words (e.g. ‘for,’ ‘which,’ etc.) had much the same function as punctuation. Repeated use of the word ‘and’ allowed the reader to more easily locate the individual words.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> This last phrase is difficult to translate literally: ‘dormiebat’ means to sleep, but ‘sopore’ is an adverb meaning sleepy. The two words together emphasize that it was a deep sleep. But adding ‘gravi’ makes qualifies this deep sleep even further, in that it was painful or grave or heavy.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The men of this ship are repeatedly referred to as ‘viri,’ not merely as ‘homines.’ The word ‘vir’ is rather like the English word ‘gentleman’ in that it implies something about the man other than that he is an adult male. The root of the word ‘viri’ is a word meaning virtue or strength. The men of this ship were not bad men, yet they threw Jonah overboard, in accordance with God’s will.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> Also, though the Douay-Rheims translates this as ‘rowed hard,’ the word ‘hard’ is not justified by the Latin text. However, the very fact that they were rowing shows the extraordinary effort that they went to, since this was certainly a sailing vessel, with oars only for exceptional circumstances.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Rise, and go to Nineveh, the great city. And preach in it the preaching that I say to you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the men of Nineveh believed in God. And they proclaimed a fast, and they put on sackcloth, from the greatest all the way to the least.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And word reached the king of Nineveh. And he rose from his throne, and he threw off his robe from himself and was clothed in sackcloth, and he sat in ashes.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The first part of this verse seems redundant. He cried out and said (dixit) . . . saying (dicens).... It seems that the second use of this verb is part of the decree itself. Therefore, it is rendered loosely as ‘let it be said,’ rather than as ‘saying,’ because the context is a formal decree.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> Here is an unusual example of the use of ‘vir’ in the singular to refer to a group of persons, similar to the use of Man to signify mankind in English. The man who must convert from his evil way is mankind. This becomes clear with the use of the plural in the last part of the verse.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> This verse has a question mark, but it is more of a statement than a question. The question mark is probably not necessary in the English translation. Notice that ‘et non peribimus’ is translated as ‘so that we might not perish,’ instead of ‘and we might not perish.’ The word ‘et’ is not always equivalent to the English word ‘and.’</span></div>
