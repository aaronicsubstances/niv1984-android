<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>From the desert and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Your wives, and children, and cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us we will do; and whithersoever thou shalt send us, we will go.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said: Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The men that were hidden were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: Sehon and Og whom you slew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And hearing these things we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us at your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now therefore swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewn mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father’s house: and give me a true token,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath which thou hast made us swear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-2-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done. And sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-2-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-2-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came to Josue the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither and hear the word of the Lord your God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-3-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jordan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-236-10-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.</span></div>
