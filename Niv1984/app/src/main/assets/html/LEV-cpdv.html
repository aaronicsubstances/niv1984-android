<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-1' href='#cpdv-verse-14-1'>a</a>. <span> In the earlier verse (14:4), the word ‘vermiculum’ was used to refer to the dyed cloth, but now ‘cocco’ is used. Each of those two Latin words refers to a dyed cloth by the source of the dye, which in both cases produces a reddish color in the cloth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-2' href='#cpdv-verse-14-2'>b</a>. <span> A sextarium (Roman measure) is used in the Latin text to represent a ‘log’ which is an ancient Hebrew unit of liquid measure equivalent to 1/12th of a ‘hin’ or about 1/3 of a U.S. quart.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-3' href='#cpdv-verse-14-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘leprosy’ in this context probably refers to some type of mold that may have afflicted some of the houses, since these were built with stone and some type of clay mortar. Therefore, the word ‘leprosy’ in ancient times had a much broader meaning than it has today.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-4' href='#cpdv-verse-14-4'>d</a>. <span> Here is an example where the word ‘et’ does not mean ‘and’, but means ‘or’ instead. The man who sleeps in it must surely wash his clothes, even if he does not eat anything. Also, clearly, the man who has a meal in it must also wash. So the meaning is ‘or’ not ‘and’.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-25-1' href='#cpdv-verse-25-1'>a</a>. <span> The Hebrew word Shabbat (Shin-Bet-Tav) means to rest; so the Latin expression ‘sabbatizes sabbatum’ means to rest on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-25-2' href='#cpdv-verse-25-2'>b</a>. <span> The Sabbatical years began in springtime, but the Jubilee year began in autumn, so it overlapped the 49th and Sabbatical year and the 50th year, which was also the first year in the next cycle of years.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-25-3' href='#cpdv-verse-25-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘statim’ does not always mean ‘immediately’, but often has more of the meaning of ‘in the present time’.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-25-4' href='#cpdv-verse-25-4'>d</a>. <span> The Sabbatical year, in the times before Herod the great captured Jerusalem, was counted from spring to spring, not from fall to fall, as the Jews today count it. The Jews could plant in the fall of year 6; they could not harvest the following spring, because year 7, the Sabbatical year, had begun. But there would be a full crop in the field from the previous fall’s planting. Then, in the fall of year 7, the crop would self-sow, producing a full crop for harvest in year 8, that is, in year 1 of the next cycle of seven years. But the Jubilee year began in the fall, that is, in the fall of year 7. So the following spring, in year 8, they still could not harvest the crop, but again they could eat from the field what had self-sown the previous fall. Then in the fall of year 8 the Jubilee year would be over, since it began in the fall of the previous year, overlapping with the end of the Sabbatical year. That is why they could then plant in the fall of year 8, because the Jubilee year was over. After the Jews changed the count of the Sabbatical years to the fall, they began to suffer from famine during Sabbatical and Jubilee years because the crops no longer self-sowed and the time for refraining from sowing and planting became extended to 2 full years, from one full Sabbatical year and one overlapping Jubilee year.</span></div>
