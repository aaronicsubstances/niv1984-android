<h2 id='dra-bookmark-1-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his nativity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For he shall be great before the Lord; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-18-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-19-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-20-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God; and am sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-21-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the people were waiting for Zachary; and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them, and remained dumb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-25-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-26-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-35-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-36-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-37-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Because no word shall be impossible with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-42-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-43-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-44-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-46-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-47-1-46'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-48-1-47'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-49-1-48'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-50-1-49'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-51-1-50'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-52-1-51'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-53-1-52'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-54-1-53'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-55-1-54'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-56-1-55'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-57-1-56'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-58-1-57'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Now Elizabeth’s full time of being delivered was come, and she brought forth a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-59-1-58'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her, and they congratulated with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-60-1-59'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by his father’s name Zachary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-61-1-60'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>And his mother answering, said: Not so; but he shall be called John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-62-1-61'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-63-1-62'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-64-1-63'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-65-1-64'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-66-1-65'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>And fear came upon all their neighbours; and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-67-1-66'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-68-1-67'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost; and he prophesied, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-69-1-68'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-70-1-69'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-71-1-70'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-72-1-71'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-73-1-72'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-74-1-73'><span class='verse-num'>[73]</span> <span>The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-75-1-74'><span class='verse-num'>[74]</span> <span>That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-76-1-75'><span class='verse-num'>[75]</span> <span>In holiness and justice before him, all our days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-77-1-76'><span class='verse-num'>[76]</span> <span>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-78-1-77'><span class='verse-num'>[77]</span> <span>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their sins:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-79-1-78'><span class='verse-num'>[78]</span> <span>Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-80-1-79'><span class='verse-num'>[79]</span> <span>To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-81-1-80'><span class='verse-num'>[80]</span> <span>And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-84-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-85-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-86-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-87-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and family of David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-88-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-89-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-90-2-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-91-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-92-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-99-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-100-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.</span></div>
