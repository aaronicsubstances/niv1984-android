<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Cursed is the deceitful, who holds in his flock a male, and, when making a vow, offers in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘Nonne’ gives both questions the connotation of ‘isn’t it true that....’ Although the word ‘Nonne’ is not repeated in Latin, the meaning applies to both and so it is, in effect, repeated in the translation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The blind, lame, and sick who are offered for sacrifice, in the Old Testament context, is the animals offered as sacrifice. But in the New Testament context, the blind, lame, and sick who are offered as a sacrifice to God are those who enter the priesthood or religious life, but who are unfit for such service due to spiritual blindness, lameness, or sickness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> The Latin uses a different word in this verse to refer to the face of God than to refer to the face of man.</span></div>

For you have not taken it to heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Behold, I will cast forth an arm to you, and I will scatter across your face the dung of your solemnities, and it will take you to itself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>My covenant was with him for life and peace. And I gave him fear, and he feared me, and he was afraid before the face of my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and integrity, and he turned away many from iniquity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the lips of the priests will keep knowledge, and they will request the law from his mouth, because he is an angel of the Lord of hosts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you have withdrawn from the way, and you have scandalized very many in the law. You have nullified the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Because of this, I also have made you contemptible and debased to all the people, just as you have not served my ways, and you have accepted a face in the law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Is there not one Father of us all? Did not one God create us? Why, then, does each one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Judah has transgressed, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has contaminated the sanctified of the Lord, which he loved, and has held the daughter of a strange god.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And you have said, “What is the reason for this?” It is because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised. Yet she was your partner, and the wife of your covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Did not One make her, and is she not the remainder of his spirit? And what does one seek, except offspring of God? So then, preserve your spirit, and do not despise the wife of your youth.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> This last phrase could mean that the priests have accepted the law superficially, or that the priests have shown partiality in the law by accepting one person above another, or that the priests have taken their face (based their reputation and outward appearances) on the law, but without following it.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘sanctificationem’ means holiness or sanctity, or something that is holy or sanctified. In the Catholic view, this may refer to the Sacraments, and particularly to the Sacrament of the Eucharist; it may also refer to those who are sanctified by the Sacraments.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> This last phrase could mean that God prevents those that have offended Him from offering a gift to Him; or it could mean that those who offend are prevented from joining those who offer a gift.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> The first part of this verse could be interpreted to mean that, if you hold hatred for your wife, send her away (but then iniquity will be your garment). Or it could be interpreted to mean, if you hold hatred, send the hatred away, in which iniquity will not be your garment.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘angelum’ could also be translated as ‘messenger.’ The messenger is John the Baptist, who is like an angel in that he has never committed any personal sins. The word ‘Dominator’ is not the same as the word ‘Dominus.’ The former means ‘Sovereign’ or ‘Master,’ whereas the latter means ‘Lord.’ The verb ‘veniet’ is usually translated as ‘will come,’ but this expression is overused in Bible translations. There are other possible accurate translations of this word, such as ‘will arrive’ or ‘will approach’ that may better fit a particular context. The ‘angelus testamenti’ is John the Baptist, who gives testimony that Jesus is the true Christ.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘conflans’ means ‘to burn together,’ as when something is refined.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘maleficis’ is sometimes translated as sorcerers, but it literally means ‘evil-doers.’ The word ‘calumniantur’ usually refers to making false accusations, but in this context it refers to those who misrepresent the wages or moneys due to a worker, widow, or orphan.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘configimus’ can mean ‘to affix with nails’ or ‘to pierce through’ with something. The meaning is close to that of crucifixion. Also, ‘configitis’ is made more intense in meaning, by the prefix ‘con,’ than ‘affliget.’</span></div>
