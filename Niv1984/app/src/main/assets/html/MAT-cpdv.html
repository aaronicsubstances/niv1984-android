<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And so, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the transmigration of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the transmigration of Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the procreation of the Christ occurred in this way. After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they lived together, she was found to have conceived in her womb by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Joseph, her husband, since he was just and was not willing to hand her over, preferred to send her away secretly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But while thinking over these things, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife.

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And she shall give birth to a son. And you shall call his name JESUS. For he shall accomplish the salvation of his people from their sins.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now all this occurred in order to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Joseph, arising from sleep, did just as the Angel of the Lord had instructed him, and he accepted her as his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he knew her not, yet she bore her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.</span></div>

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Notice that after many uses of the formula ‘one man conceived another man,’ the passage does not say that Joseph conceived (genuit) Jesus. The break in this formula indicates the understanding of Matthew and of the Church from its earliest days, that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The expression ‘in utero habebit’ literally means ‘shall have in the womb.’ But this verse is a quote from Isaiah 7:14, which, in the Latin, uses ‘virgo concipiet’ rather than ‘in utero habebit.’ Therefore, the use of the translation ‘shall conceive in her womb’ to convey the expression ‘shall have in the womb’ is justified. Verse 18 which has a similar expression, with a similar translation.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-30'>Matthew 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And so, when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judah, in the days of king Herod, behold, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>saying: “Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and we have come to adore him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now king Herod, hearing this, was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And gathering together all the leaders of the priests, and the scribes of the people, he consulted with them as to where the Christ would be born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea. For so it has been written by the prophet:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>‘And you, Bethlehem, the land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah. For from you shall go forth the ruler who shall guide my people Israel.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Herod, quietly calling the Magi, diligently learned from them the time when the star appeared to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And sending them into Bethlehem, he said: “Go and diligently ask questions about the boy. And when you have found him, report back to me, so that I, too, may come and adore him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had heard the king, they went away. And behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them, even until, arriving, it stood still above the place where the child was.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then, seeing the star, they were gladdened by a very great joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And entering the home, they found the boy with his mother Mary. And so, falling prostrate, they adored him. And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And having received a response in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back by another way to their own region.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And after they had gone away, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: “Rise up, and take the boy and his mother, and flee into Egypt. And remain there until I tell you. For it will happen that Herod will seek the boy to destroy him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And getting up, he took the boy and his mother by night, and withdrew into Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And he remained there, until the death of Herod, in order to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt, I called my son.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Herod, seeing that he had been fooled by the Magi, was very angry. And so he sent to kill all the boys who were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had learned by questioning the Magi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>“A voice has been heard in Ramah, great weeping and wailing: Rachel crying for her sons. And she was not willing to be consoled, because they were no more.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then, when Herod had passed away, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>saying: “Rise up, and take the boy and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For those who were seeking the life of the boy have passed away.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And rising up, he took the boy and his mother, and he went into the land of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then, hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in sleep, he withdrew into parts of Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And arriving, he lived in a city which is called Nazareth, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: “For he shall be called a Nazarene.”</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘cedebat’ sometimes has the meaning of falling, or descending. The star did not merely continue to lead them forward, but it also descended as it led them through Bethlehem. Otherwise, they could not have known from a star (or comet) which location within Bethlehem was correct.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that the words ‘ploratus, plorans’ are translated differently, as ‘weeping, crying.’ It sometimes happens that the same word used twice is translated by two different words in English, or that two different words in Latin are translated by the same word in English. To translated the same word in Latin by always the same word in English would result in a translation that was, at best, stilted, and, at worst, inaccurate or incorrect.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘me’ is used instead of the grammatically correct ‘than I’ because it sounds more natural in English and because it makes a better parallel with the phrase ‘after me’. Even though the verse literally says ‘and fire,’ the word ‘et’ is sometimes used in Latin in a way that it is not used in English, to combine two qualities of the same thing. So the Baptism of Christ is not Holy Spirit and also fire, but rather the figurative fire of the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-5' href='#cpdv-verse-3-5'>e</a>. <span> The words ‘should’ and ‘shall’ are not ordinarily used about God. He does not do things because they are right, nor because he should do them, but rather the things He does are right because He does them.</span></div>

Similarly, if a man is angry with his brother, he is liable to judgment to determine if he is sinning by his anger, or if his brother is guilty (as in cases of righteous anger). The same applies to the other two cases. Calling someone a name (or, to the same effect, accusing someone of something) makes one liable to judgment. As it is said in the secular courts, the truth is an effective defense against accusations of slander. So the judgment is to determine if the accusation is true, in which case the judgment would be not guilty.</span></div>

A translation such as ‘take heart’ or ‘have confidence’ would not be as accurate a translation of the Latin, because the context is that Jesus was responding to their faith. So He said to them, commenting on their faith, ‘be strengthened in faith,’ not merely ‘take heart’ or ‘have confidence.’ Notice that ‘confidence’ more closely resembles the Latin word, yet it is not the best translation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-465'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>With anyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, evil comes and carries away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received the seed by the side of the road.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-469'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Yet truly, whoever has received the seed into good soil, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, and so he bears fruit, and he produces: some a hundred fold, and another sixty fold, and another thirty fold.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-470'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He proposed another parable to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-471'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds amid the wheat, and then went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-472'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And when the plants had grown, and had produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-473'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So the servants of the Father of the family, approaching, said to him: ‘Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then how is it that it has weeds?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-474'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And he said to them, ‘A man who is an enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Is it your will that we should go and gather them up?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-475'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And he said: ‘No, lest perhaps in gathering the weeds, you might also root out the wheat together with it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-476'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Permit both to grow until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: Gather first the weeds, and bind them into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather into my storehouse.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-477'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>He proposed another parable to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-478'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>It is, indeed, the least of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is greater than all the plants, and it becomes a tree, so much so that the birds of the air come and dwell in its branches.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-480'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He spoke another parable to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of fine wheat flour, until it was entirely leavened.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-481'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds. And he did not speak to them apart from parables,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-482'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, saying: “I will open my mouth in parables. I will proclaim what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-483'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then, dismissing the crowds, he went into the house. And his disciples drew near to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-484'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Responding, he said to them: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of man.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-1' href='#cpdv-verse-19-1'>a</a>. <span> The translation here prefers ‘chaste persons’ over eunuchs or celibate persons for a number of reasons. First, the term eunuch is used figuratively by Christ, as is the term ‘castraverunt’ (castrated). Second, the term eunuch is obscure today. Third, this passage began with a teaching on the proper behavior of married persons, so it is not solely about virgins or celibate clergy and religious. The term ‘chaste persons’ has sufficient breadth and depth, and is an accurate representation of the meaning of the term.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-2' href='#cpdv-verse-19-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that Jesus specifically says ‘murder’ (homicidium), not ‘kill.’ Therefore, the Old Testament translation of the commandment as ‘You shall not murder’ is correct.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-19-3' href='#cpdv-verse-19-3'>c</a>. <span> It is often said, by the foolish, that the camel in this saying is literally a camel, and that the 'eye of a needle' is a particular gate into the city of Jerusalem. They claim that Jesus was only referring to getting a camel through that small gateway, when he expressed how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. But even though that gateway is narrow, it is not too difficult to get a camel through it. Perhaps it happened on a near daily basis. If this was the meaning of the saying, then it would not seem too difficult for the wealthy to enter heaven, and the disciples would be foolish to say 'Then who will be able to be saved?' And again, if so, then Jesus would not have said that it was impossible for men. So the saying has another meaning. It is a literal expression of the miraculous power of God. For a wealthy person to be saved, apart from the infinite mercy of God is impossible, nearly as impossible as literally passing a camel through the eye of a needle. But both acts can be done by the power of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1047'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then Peter responded by saying to him, “Even if everyone else has fallen away from you, I will never fall away.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1048'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus said to him, “Amen I say to you, that in this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1054'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And he approached his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter: “So, were you not able to keep vigil with me for one hour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1055'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Be vigilant and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation. Indeed, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1056'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Again, a second time, he went and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this chalice cannot pass away, unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1058'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And leaving them behind, again he went and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1059'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Then he approached his disciples and said to them: “Sleep now and rest. Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1060'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Rise up; let us go. Behold, he who will betray me draws near.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1061'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1063'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And quickly drawing close to Jesus, he said, “Hail, Master.” And he kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1064'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And Jesus said to him, “Friend, for what purpose have you come?” Then they approached, and they put their hands on Jesus, and they held him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1069'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>In that same hour, Jesus said to the crowds: “You went out, as if to a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me. Yet I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not take hold of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1070'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples fled, abandoning him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1074'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>And they did not find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. Then, at the very end, two false witnesses came forward,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1075'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>and they said, “This man said: ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and, after three days, to rebuild it.’ ”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1076'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>And the high priest, rising up, said to him, “Have you nothing to respond to what these ones testify against you?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1077'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I bind you by an oath to the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1078'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>Jesus said to him: “You have said it. Yet truly I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1079'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: “He has blasphemed. Why do we still need witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1080'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>How does it seem to you?” So they responded by saying, “He is guilty unto death.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1081'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>Then they spit in his face, and they struck him with fists. And others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1083'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>Yet truly, Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a maidservant approached him, saying, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1084'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>But he denied it in the sight of them all, saying, “I do not know what you are saying.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1085'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>Then, as he exited by the gate, another maidservant saw him. And she said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1086'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>And again, he denied it with an oath, “For I do not know the man.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1087'><span class='verse-num'>[73]</span> <span>And after a little while, those who were standing nearby came and said to Peter: “Truly, you also are one of them. For even your manner of speaking reveals you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1088'><span class='verse-num'>[74]</span> <span>Then he began to curse and to swear that he had not known the man. And immediately the rooster crowed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1089'><span class='verse-num'>[75]</span> <span>And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, which he had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And going outside, he wept bitterly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1092'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then, when morning arrived, all the leaders of the priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so that they might deliver him to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1093'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And they led him, bound, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the procurator.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1097'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed. And going out, he hanged himself with a snare.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1098'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But the leaders of the priests, having taken up the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the temple offerings, because it is the price of blood.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1099'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then, having taken counsel, they bought the potter’s field with it, as a burying place for sojourners.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1118'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the entire people responded by saying, “May his blood be upon us and upon our children.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1119'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then he released Barabbas to them. But Jesus, having been scourged, he handed over to them, so that he would be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1120'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the soldiers of the procurator, taking Jesus up to the praetorium, gathered the entire cohort around him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-1122'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And plaiting a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head, with a reed in his right hand. And genuflecting before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews.”</span></div>

Therefore, the salvation of those who go to Heaven is not dependent on Judas having been sent to Hell. Yet Judas next despaired of the Mercy of God, killing himself. Therefore, he went to Hell for the latter sin, not for the former sin.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-27-2' href='#cpdv-verse-27-2'>b</a>. <span> The text in Latin does not say any word referring to a dream. The word ‘visum’ means vision. Also, she says ‘today,’ not ‘in the night,’ and there is no reference to sleep. Compare this to other references in Scripture about dreams versus visions. It is clear that this was a vision, not a dream.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-27-3' href='#cpdv-verse-27-3'>c</a>. <span> The word ‘latrones’ in Latin specifically refers to robbers, not to thieves.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-27-4' href='#cpdv-verse-27-4'>d</a>. <span> Literally the text says “for he said ‘that I am the Son of God’ ” Quotations were written differently in that time period than they are today. We would say either, “for he said that he is the Son of God,” or, “for he said: ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” But the text has something of a combination of those two approaches.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-27-5' href='#cpdv-verse-27-5'>e</a>. <span> Correct translations of this last phrase would include: ‘he gave up his spirit,’ ‘he breathed his last breath,’ ‘he gave up his life,’ ‘he uttered his last breath,’ and other phrasings. But a very literal translation of this particular phrase would be misleading: ‘he sent out the spirit.’</span></div>

This period of time is similar to the time after sunset, when it is not yet dark. The length of this time is approximately an hour. Although the word ‘evening’ is used very broadly today, it specifically refers to that period of time between sunset and darkness, or, as in this case, between darkness and sunrise. So the two Marys set out at evening, that is, at first light in the morning, but before sunrise. The translation avoids this confusion of terms by using morning, instead of evening.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-28-2' href='#cpdv-verse-28-2'>b</a>. <span> Notice that Matthew, after the Crucifixion, begins to count Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, as the Sabbath. Whereas, elsewhere in his Gospel, he counts Saturday as the Sabbath. He also states that this day is the first (Christian) Sabbath.</span></div>
