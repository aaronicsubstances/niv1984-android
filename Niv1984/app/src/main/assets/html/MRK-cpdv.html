<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>As it has been written by the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, I send my Angel before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The voice of one crying out in the desert: Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight his paths.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance, as a remission of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And there went out to him all the region of Judea and all those of Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-8-f'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-1" id="cpdv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he preached, saying: “One stronger than me comes after me. I am not worthy to reach down and loosen the laces of his shoes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-10-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I have baptized you with water. Yet truly, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-11-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And it happened that, in those days, Jesus arrived from Nazareth of Galilee. And he was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And immediately, upon ascending from the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit, like a dove, descending, and remaining with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-13-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And there was a voice from heaven: “You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And immediately the Spirit prompted him into the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he was in the desert for forty days and forty nights. And he was tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the Angels ministered to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then, after John was handed over, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and saying: “For the time has been fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the Gospel.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And passing by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew, casting nets into the sea, for they were fishermen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-18'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And at once abandoning their nets, they followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21-1-19'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And continuing on a little ways from there, he saw James of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were mending their nets in a boat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22-1-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And immediately he called them. And leaving behind their father Zebedee in the boat with his hired hands, they followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23-1-21'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they entered into Capernaum. And entering into the synagogue promptly on the Sabbaths, he taught them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24-1-22'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And they were astonished over his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one who has authority, and not like the scribes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25-1-23'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And in their synagogue, there was a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26-1-24'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>saying: “What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27-1-25'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And Jesus admonished him, saying, “Be silent, and depart from the man.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-28-1-26'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, departed from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29-1-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And they were all so amazed that they inquired among themselves, saying: “What is this? And what is this new doctrine? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30-1-28'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And his fame went out quickly, throughout the entire region of Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-31-1-29'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And soon after departing from the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-32-1-30'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the mother-in-law of Simon lay ill with a fever. And at once they told him about her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33-1-31'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And drawing near to her, he raised her up, taking her by the hand. And immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34-1-32'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then, when evening arrived, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who had maladies and those who had demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35-1-33'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And the entire city was gathered together at the door.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36-1-34'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And he healed many who were troubled with various illnesses. And he cast out many demons, but he would not permit them to speak, because they knew him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37-1-35'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And rising up very early, departing, he went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38-1-36'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And Simon, and those who were with him, followed after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39-1-37'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And when they had found him, they said to him, “For everyone is seeking you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40-1-38'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And he said to them: “Let us go into the neighboring towns and cities, so that I may preach there also. Indeed, it was for this reason that I came.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41-1-39'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And he was preaching in their synagogues and throughout all of Galilee, and casting out demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42-1-40'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And a leper came to him, begging him. And kneeling down, he said to him, “If you are willing, you are able to cleanse me.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43-1-41'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then Jesus, taking pity on him, reached out his hand. And touching him, he said to him: “I am willing. Be cleansed.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44-1-42'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And after he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45-1-43'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And he admonished him, and he promptly sent him away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46-1-44'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And he said to him: “See to it that you tell no one. But go and show yourself to the high priest, and offer for your cleansing that which Moses instructed, as a testimony for them.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47-1-45'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>But having departed, he began to preach and to disseminate the word, so that he was no longer able to openly enter a city, but had to remain outside, in deserted places. And they were gathered to him from every direction.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-49-2'>Mark 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50-2-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And after some days, he again entered into Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And it was heard that he was in the house. And so many gathered that there was no room left, not even at the door. And he spoke the word to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they came to him, bringing a paralytic, who was being carried by four men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when they were not able to present him to him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And opening it, they lowered down the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then, when Jesus had seen their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55-2-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But some of the scribes were sitting in that place and thinking in their hearts:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-57-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>At once, Jesus, realizing in his spirit that they were thinking this within themselves, said to them: “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-58-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up, take up your stretcher, and walk?’</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralytic:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>“I say to you: Rise up, take up your stretcher, and go into your house.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And immediately he got up, and lifting up his stretcher, he went away in the sight of them all, so that they all wondered. And they honored God, by saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he departed again to the sea. And the entire crowd came to him, and he taught them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And as he was passing by, he saw Levi of Alphaeus, sitting at the customs office. And he said to him, “Follow me.” And rising up, he followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And it happened that, as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat at table together with Jesus and his disciples. For those who followed him were many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-77-2-27'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And he said to them: “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</span></div>
