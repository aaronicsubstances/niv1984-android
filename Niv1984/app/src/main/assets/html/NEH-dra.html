<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And I said: I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father’s house have sinned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant Moses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And these are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-2-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart.

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-2-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-17'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-34-2-20'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.</span></div>
