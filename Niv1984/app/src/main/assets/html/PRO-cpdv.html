<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘gubernacula’ could also more generally refer to ‘positions of leadership.’ Note how sapiens and intelligens are used as nouns, but audiens is used as a participle; this is discerned from the context.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘foolish’ is a better translation than ‘fools’ because ‘foolish’ describes a person by their behavior, which may change.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> A ‘torques’ can refer to a necklace of twisted metal, but it can also refer to non-metal adornment around the neck. In this translation, using a Christological and specifically Roman Catholic meaning, the text is taken as referring to the collar of a priest.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Why are these parables addressed to ‘my son,’ i.e. to a man, or to men in general? First, it is Solomon speaking to David, which in essence is itself a parable of a wise father speaking to his son. Second, in a special way, God is using this book to speak to priests. Third, it foreshadows the wisdom of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Fourth, we are all (men, women, and children) called to be like the Son of God. And there may be other reasons.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-1' href='#cpdv-verse-5-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘meretricis’ can mean prostitute, but it can also, more often, refer to a woman who behaves like a prostitute: either a kept woman with only one lover, or a promiscuous woman with many lovers. The translation as ‘loose woman’ is a better fit for the meaning of the text. As is clear from the previous verse, this passage is not merely warning against prostitution, but against loose living.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-2' href='#cpdv-verse-5-2'>b</a>. <span> This verse seems to contradict the previous and subsequent verses. The original Douay-Rheims version has a note that relates water to doctrine. My understanding of that note: distribute good doctrine far and wide among men of sincere intention, but not to those who make themselves to be foreigners to the truth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-3' href='#cpdv-verse-5-3'>c</a>. <span> The previous verse (5:15) refers to drinking water from ones own well. This can refer to doctrine, as verses 12 to 14 indicate. This can also refer to chastity and marriage, as the subsequent verses indicate. However, verse 5:16 cannot be taken to refer to sexuality, but only to doctrine. It often happens, as Scripture weaves together comments on a variety of related subjects, that some verses are to be understood more narrowly, and others more broadly.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-4' href='#cpdv-verse-5-4'>d</a>. <span> When applied to doctrine, this verse and the previous one can be understood in a number of ways. Concerning doctrine, one can distribute it far and wide, sharing it in the streets. Or one can keep it to oneself, so that only you and God know your thoughts about the Faith. But in either case, one cannot ‘let strangers be partakers’ casting the pearls of true doctrine before those swine who ridicule and despise the truth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-5' href='#cpdv-verse-5-5'>e</a>. <span> It is not so unusual to have two consecutive verses that seem to contradict one another. This technique of writing causes the reader to think about the correct meaning of each verse. This is also seen later in Proverbs when the topic is responding to the foolish according to their folly.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-5-6' href='#cpdv-verse-5-6'>f</a>. <span> So then, rejoice in true doctrine with your beloved wife. Share the Faith with her. But also, this verse refers in a figurative manner to marital relations.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> One meaning of this passage is to refer to the Antichrist. The word ‘inutilis’ can mean ‘useless,’ but in the context of apostasy and perverse words, it must have its alternate meaning, which is ‘harmful.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> Again, this refers, in one level of meaning to the Antichrist. He will have a reign of six years, plus part of a seventh year. The six things are the six full years of his reign, and the seventh is the most detestable time of his reign (when he attempts to make a false ascension to the heavens). The number 616 refers to the Antichrist’s name: six letters in his first name, six letters in this last name, with his middle initial in-between.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-3' href='#cpdv-verse-6-3'>c</a>. <span> These three verses (6:17-19) are a description of the Antichrist: he tries to sow discord among the brethren of the Church; he bears false witness against the true Christ.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-4' href='#cpdv-verse-6-4'>d</a>. <span> The negative things that are said in the Book of Proverbs about an evil woman or a loose (or kept) woman, can also be applied to the false prophet, who is a associated with the Antichrist and who will be a female antipope.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> The loaf is the false Eucharist promoted by this female false prophet, especially when she becomes antipope.
