<h2>Psalm 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>They would not be like their forefathers-- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them. </span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. </span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</span></div>

<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</span></div>
