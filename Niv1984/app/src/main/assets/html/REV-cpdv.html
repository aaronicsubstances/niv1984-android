<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, like that of a trumpet,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>saying, “What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven Churches, which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I turned around, so as to see the voice which was speaking with me. And having turned around, I saw seven golden lampstands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And in the midst of the seven golden lampstands was one resembling the Son of man, clothed to the feet with a vestment, and wrapped to the breast with a wide belt of gold.</span></div>

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-28-n'>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Here is an example where the meaning of ‘et’ clearly corresponds to the English word ‘or’, not to the word ‘and’. These first three verses appear to have been added afterward by John’s disciples, when they were translating this book from the original Aramaic, in which John wrote, into Greek.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> The seven Churches represent the universal Church on earth after the Orthodox and Protestant Churches repent (in the late 2010's) and unite with the Catholic Church (in the early 2020's) as one Catholic Church with seven divisions within unity: one part for the Latin Rite, one part for the Eastern Churches (within which there may still be separate sui juris churches), and five parts for the formerly Protestant Churches. These seven are also represented in the Gospels by the seven baskets full of fragments, and by the fives loaves and two fish, at the two miracles of the loaves.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Here the word ‘et’ is translated as ‘and’ but actually has a slightly different meaning; it does not mean that God and the Father are two completely different things. It means ‘God and [especially/specifically] his Father.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Christ will return bodily, descending visibly from the sky, just as at his Ascension he ascended visibly into the sky and then invisibly into Heaven. His return will not be in secret. When Christ returns, all will see and know, throughout the world, even those who pierced him by crucifying His Church.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> John originally wrote the Book of Revelation in Aramaic (see my article on this point). And when Christ spoke to John saying 'I am the Alpha and the Omega' he probably did not speak in Greek, but in Aramaic or Hebrew. So the words Alpha and Omega are a translation. So this sentence becomes either, in Aramaic, “I am the Alap and the Tau,” or, in Hebrew, “I am the Aleph and the Tof.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> John was on Patmos, in my chronology, in the early A.D. 80's, beginning about A.D. 82, for about 2 or 3 years or so. He was put there by the emperor Domitian, who had first tried to have John killed. John was placed in a pot of boiling oil. All the other 11 of the 12 Apostles (Matthias replacing Judas) had already been martyred. But John was not martyred. When he came out of the boiling oil, he was unharmed and looked refreshed, as if he had just taken a bath in water, rather than boiling oil. So the emperor, unaffected by this miracle, exiled John to Patmos, where other Christians also had been exiled, working in the copper mines there. John became a target of Domitian because John had, some years earlier, written the Gospel of John.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> The seven stars are the seven parts into which the Church will be restructured in the early 2020's, when the Orthodox Church and all the Protestant Churches repent and unite with the Catholic Church. There will be seven divisions within unity. This passage refers primarily to those seven parts of the Church.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-2' href='#cpdv-verse-2-2'>b</a>. <span> This could mean that charity is no longer first among these Christians, or that they no longer have charity to the degree that they had at first. Or both.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> The Nicolaitans were an early heretical group. They took their name from one of the first seven Deacons, but he was never a part of the group, he did not establish it, and he would not have approved of it. They were know for sexual promiscuity. This group foreshadows groups in the present and near future. For example, there are the Society of Saint Pius X, who take their name from Pope Pius X, but he was never a part of the group, he did not establish it, and he would not have approved of it. And in the future, there will be groups that push for women deacons. The Church will approve of the ordination of women deacons, but the deeds of those who demand women deacons are hateful to God.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> This reference to Jews who are associated with Satan refers to the fact that, in the second part of the tribulation, during the time of the Antichrist in the distant future, a significant number of Jews will follow the Antichrist. But later many of these will repent of this sin and will convert and follow Christ. It is those Jews who are a synagogue of Satan, and who will blaspheme against the true Christians of that time. But some devout Jews during that time will not follow the Antichrist at all, but will recognize that he is evil.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-5' href='#cpdv-verse-2-5'>e</a>. <span> Notice that the Latin word here means 'spear,' not 'sword.'</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-6' href='#cpdv-verse-2-6'>f</a>. <span> In the Church today and in the near future, the role of women will continue to be a problem, with some groups and religious leaders giving women roles that are contrary to the will of God. This will particularly be a problem in the 2020's, when the Protestant Churches are united with the Catholic Church. There are many women ministers and many men used to the idea of women pastors among some Protestant groups. Also, sexual ethics are looser in Protestant theology than in Catholic theology.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-7' href='#cpdv-verse-2-7'>g</a>. <span> The first part of the tribulation will be more severe for those who are more sinful.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-8' href='#cpdv-verse-2-8'>h</a>. <span> Her 'sons' are those who follow her heretical teachings. This may also refer to soldiers dying in warfare, because it is generally young men who are sent to war.</span></div>

The living creature with a face like a man is Gospel of Luke, because Luke was a Gentile convert and who wrote in a Gentile nation for the Gentile converts (such as Theophilus); they are represented by the face of a man because Christ called them from being mere men apart from God to the fullness of humanity revealed only by Christ.

<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> The first Seal is the first horseman of the Apocalypse. The first four Seals are grouped together, by being represented each by one of four horsemen, because they are a related series of events. The first horseman is World War III.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> The second Seal is the second horseman of the Apocalypse, which is severe worldwide civil violence and disorder.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-3' href='#cpdv-verse-6-3'>c</a>. <span> The third Seal and the third horseman is the great famine of the 21st century, which begins about the time of World War 3. This famine will not end until all the Protestant Churches, and the Orthodox Church, repent and unite with the Catholic Church in one holy unified Church with seven parts. This is the famine predicted by Jesus in the parable of the Prodigal Son.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-4' href='#cpdv-verse-6-4'>d</a>. <span> This verse says that a denarius (a day's pay) will buy one double measure of wheat, but three double measures of barley. During Biblical times, wheat was the grain of the wealthy, and barley was the food of the poor. Therefore, this famine will be unusual, because it will be more severe in wealthy nations and less severe in poor nations. Wine and oil were luxury items during the time that these verses were written. The wealthy nations will lack basic necessities like food, but will have various kinds of modern day luxury items. The famine will be most severe in the wealthy nations of Europe because of the war; it will afflict the United States with a lesser severity. Third world and developing nations will be less affected, because they grow their food locally and they are not as affected by the war.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> A libra is an ancient Greek unit of weight equaling about 11 or 12 ounces; so a bilibra is about 23 ounces of weight.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-6' href='#cpdv-verse-6-6'>f</a>. <span> The fourth Seal and the fourth horseman is the set of results from the war and the civil unrest and the famine, especially, but not limited to, death from a variety of different causes. The devastating effects of these first three Seals is the fourth Seal, for war and violence and famine have lasting effects, making people more susceptible to disease, causing extreme poverty, joblessness, homelessness, and economic ruin, and many other consequences. But these shall be tempered by the mercy of God.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-7' href='#cpdv-verse-6-7'>g</a>. <span> The fifth Seal is not a fifth horseman, because now the war and the civil unrest and the famine have ended, though their effects linger on. The fifth Seal is a great persecution and martyrdom of Christians in the occupied territories by the Arab/Muslim extremists. Do not blame this massacre on all Muslims, nor on all Arabs, but only on the extremists who are now drunk with power. God gave them victory in the war because of the sins of the nations that they conquered; but they now act as if they were gods, deciding life and death. This massacre will be like the Jewish Holocaust, except that it will be mostly Christians who are put to death. This Christian Holocaust will be even more severe than the Jewish Holocaust. The worst of this massacre occurs during the latter part of the occupation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-8' href='#cpdv-verse-6-8'>h</a>. <span> The sixth Seal is World War IV. This war is started by the Allied (free) nations because the extremists have been killing millions of Christians, and because now that they have many nuclear missiles there is nothing to stop them from nuking and conquering the free nations. The Allies develop a nuclear weapon with very little radioactivity (pure fusion weapons). They attack the extremists in a nuclear first strike. They also attack with massive air and naval power. The extremists reply with nuclear missiles. This war is the most devastating war that the human race has ever seen. Very many nuclear weapons are used by both sides. The great monarch is the preeminent leader among the Allies. He has the blessing of the Pope. His troops are few and holy. The Allies call upon the help of God and of His Angels. Otherwise, they would not succeed.</span></div>

The rest of those sealed will be sealed towards the end of World War IV (which is the sixth of the seven seals) about the year 2037. Not every faithful Catholic Christian will be sealed. Many who are in a state of grace will not be sealed. Only certain faithful souls receive the seal. I do not know how they are chosen by God, but they will be mostly Catholic Christians. Those without the seal can still go to Heaven.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-3' href='#cpdv-verse-7-3'>c</a>. <span> The ones with the Seal on their foreheads are the holy servants of God who are spared from most of the remaining afflictions; these are relatively few, since they can be numbered. But the ones without the seal are the great crowd, which no one could number; these go through the remaining afflictions, and very many of them will die. But they can still be saved by enduring these afflictions with God’s grace. They are the larger number, so large that they cannot be counted.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-2' href='#cpdv-verse-8-2'>b</a>. <span> In the year 2038, a comet which has broken into pieces (probably Comet Tempel I) will approach the earth. Many of its medium and smaller sized pieces will fall to the earth. Comets are frozen like hail, but they burn with fire as they pass through the atmosphere. This event will affect a third of the earth's inhabited land mass. An extremely large number of human lives will be lost, along with great destruction to society, to plants and animals, and to the environment in general. The phrase 'green plants' refers to newly sprouting plants, since 'viride' can refer specifically to newly green plants, i.e. plants that have recently sprouted. So not all greenery is destroyed.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-3' href='#cpdv-verse-8-3'>c</a>. <span> One of the larger pieces of this comet will fall into the ocean. This will cause great devastation at sea and will cause huge tidal waves to inundate areas near the shore. Very many more human lives will be lost; very many ships and many cities will be utterly destroyed; many fish will die.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-4' href='#cpdv-verse-8-4'>d</a>. <span> This star burning like a torch refers to the radioactive fallout from certain nuclear weapons (those made using plutonium or uranium) used in World War IV (the Sixth Seal). Radioactivity from nuclear weapons takes time to rise up into the upper atmosphere, to circulate around the world, and then to fall slowly to earth. Once this occurs, during and after World War IV, radioactivity will be found in the oceans, especially the Atlantic, and on the land. However, the main source of the radioactivity at this time is the events of the first two Trumpets. The fires caused by the first Trumpet raise radioactive material from the land into the atmosphere, where it is next removed from the atmosphere by rain. Thus it makes numerous sources of water unusable. Then the second Trumpet strikes the ocean, causing a huge quantity of ocean water, with its radioactivity, to be raised up into the atmosphere. Again, it falls back to the earth's surface in rainwater. As a result, very many human lives will be lost, due to the radioactivity in the water.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-8-5' href='#cpdv-verse-8-5'>e</a>. <span> This decrease in the amount of light coming from the Sun and moon and stars is caused by a nuclear winter, which results not only from World War IV (an all-out nuclear war), but also from the huge number of fires caused by the falling pieces of the comet.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-1' href='#cpdv-verse-9-1'>a</a>. <span> Notice that the pluperfect tense is used, ‘had fallen.’ The fifth Angel is a holy angel, but when he sounds the trumpet, a key is given to a fallen angel to open the gates of Hell. It is surprising that a fallen angel has this role.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-2' href='#cpdv-verse-9-2'>b</a>. <span> These 'locusts' are not real locusts, but rather some type of supernatural affliction figuratively referred to as locusts. This affliction comes from the 'well of the abyss,' that is, from Hell. These figurative locusts are not a result of the previous Seals or Trumpets; it is not the affliction of radioactive fallout, nor of nuclear winter, nor of any natural disaster, nor of any man-made weapon. The five months of this affliction occurs from late 2038 to early 2039. I believe that the exact length of time is 153 days, from Nov. 8 of 2038 to April 9th of 2039, inclusive.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-3' href='#cpdv-verse-9-3'>c</a>. <span> The three woes are the fifth, sixth, and seventh Trumpets, each of which differs from the previous Trumpets and Seals because the woes are the result, not of natural disasters, nor of human actions, but of the intervention of God and of angels.

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-9-4' href='#cpdv-verse-9-4'>d</a>. <span> Notice how much more informative it is for the reader to have the translation of the words (Doom, Destroyer, Exterminator), rather than merely the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin names untranslated.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-1' href='#cpdv-verse-11-1'>a</a>. <span> The Book of Revelation prophecies the first part of the tribulation in chapters 6 through 9. Then, in chapter 10, Revelation uses the term 'the seven thunders' to refer to the long time period after the first part of the tribulation. Next, in chapter 11, Revelation moves the discussion to a new time frame, to the distant future when the second part of the tribulation occurs. This second part of the tribulation includes the reign of the Antichrist, the Return of Jesus Christ, and a series of afflictions sent by God upon the unrepentant wicked.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-2' href='#cpdv-verse-11-2'>b</a>. <span> The 42 months is the same period of time referred to later as the 1260 days of the prophesying of the two prophets. This time period is the last half of the Antichrist’s reign, when he tries to destroy the Church from within by supporting the abomination of desolation and the false prophet. The 42 months is the latter half of the Antichrist’s reign of nearly seven years.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-3' href='#cpdv-verse-11-3'>c</a>. <span> Notice that 42 months is not 1260 days in the Christian calendar, but only in a calendar which uses a 30-day month. The calendar in secular use at that time will not be the Christian calendar, but rather a lunar calendar similar to the Islamic calendar, but without religious reference.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-4' href='#cpdv-verse-11-4'>d</a>. <span> The expression ‘lord of the earth’ does not, in this context, refer to God, for it is not informative or necessary to say that God’s two prophets are in the sight of Him who sees all. Instead, it refers to the Antichrist or Satan. According to this interpretation, which is also found in the Fathers of the Church (Saint Victorinius, Commentary on the Apocalypse of Blessed John), these two prophets can stand even in view of the Antichrist and Satan, and yet neither the Antichrist nor Satan nor anyone else can do anything against these two prophets, until the time appointed by God for their deaths.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-5' href='#cpdv-verse-11-5'>e</a>. <span> It is uncertain whether these two prophets are Enoch and Elijah themselves, or two men who prophesy in their spirit and power. My opinion is that they are literally Enoch and Elijah, for Christ himself said:
<br>
“For all the prophets and the law prophesied, even until John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah, who is to come.” (Mt 11:13-14).
<br>
“Elijah, when he will arrive first, shall restore all things. And in the manner that it has been written about the Son of man, so must he suffer many things and be condemned. But I say to you, that Elijah also has arrived, (and they have done to him whatever they wanted) just as it has been written about him.” (Mk 9:11-12).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-6' href='#cpdv-verse-11-6'>f</a>. <span> John the Baptist arrived “with the spirit and power of Elijah” (Lk 1:17). So, in one sense, John the Baptist was the Elijah who was to come. But notice the use of the future tense in Mt 11:14 and in Mk 9:11. Elijah, in another sense, is still to arrive, so as to precede Christ's Return in the distant future, just as John preceded Him. Also, John the Baptist did not restore all things, but Elijah and Enoch precede the Return of Christ, which shall restore all and establish the kingdom of God on earth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-7' href='#cpdv-verse-11-7'>g</a>. <span> During that future time, Enoch will testify as one who lived before formal religion to those who have no formal religion, and Elijah will testify as one who was a devout adherent of formal religion, Judaism. Also, at that time, there will be the First Fruits on earth: Christians born in that time period who have original sin, but no personal sins whatsoever. These will be more like John the Baptist than Enoch and Elijah, for John the Baptist had original sin, but no personal sins whatsoever. The First Fruits will assist their fellow members of the Church during this persecution, being witnesses within the Church to the faithful. But Enoch and Elijah are the witnesses to those outside of the Church, and to those who were once members of the Church and yet abandoned the Faith.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-8' href='#cpdv-verse-11-8'>h</a>. <span> The lord of the earth is the Antichrist, who presents himself as if he were a god over the earth. The two prophets prophesy openly, in his sight, yet he can do nothing against them. This powerlessness over the two prophets is a sign to the people of the world that the Antichrist is a false god.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-9' href='#cpdv-verse-11-9'>i</a>. <span> Enoch and Elijah do not literally emit fire from their mouths. Rather, they can strike any person or group or place with literal fire by a word of prayer to God. No one can harm them or kill them or prevent them from prophesying, because God has given them power over their enemies.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-10' href='#cpdv-verse-11-10'>j</a>. <span> The two prophets will cause a worldwide drought as a sign to the sinners of the world that they are speaking for God and that the Antichrist is a false god. For they call for a drought, and so it happens, and the Antichrist cannot end the drought by his powers. The two prophets do not literally turn water into blood, but rather they can make water undrinkable by a word of prayer to God, and they can strike the earth with any kind of affliction, as often as they wish, with a word of prayer to God. Then, at the end of the 1260 days, God allows the two prophets to be killed.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-11' href='#cpdv-verse-11-11'>k</a>. <span> In the year 2437 A.D., when the two prophets have completed their prophesying, they will be permitted by God to be killed by Satan and the Antichrist and the false prophetess. And their bodies will like in the streets of Jerusalem, while all the peoples of the world watch (on whatever the future equivalent of 24-hour news television will be) their dead bodies. They will not permit these two to be buried, because they want to rejoice over their dead bodies. Then they will establish a new holiday, taking time off from work and exchanging gifts, to celebrate their deaths and the end of the afflictions with which they where tormented by the two prophets.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-12' href='#cpdv-verse-11-12'>l</a>. <span> The Antichrist and the false prophetess (a woman antipope) will proclaim, during this holiday, that the killing of the two prophets proves that Jesus is not the Son of God (for these two prophets proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ), and that it proves that the Antichrist is a god.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-13' href='#cpdv-verse-11-13'>m</a>. <span> Then, in the sight of the whole world (as they all watch on television), God will raise these two prophets from the dead and assume them into Heaven. (They are not assumed into the first Heaven, where only Jesus and Mary are present in both body and soul; rather, they are assumed into the new Heaven, in the future.) Now the claims of the Antichrist and the false prophetess are clearly refuted, for the two prophets (who preached Jesus Christ and who argued against the Antichrist and the false prophetess) are resurrected by God and assumed into Heaven.
<br>
“What shall we do to these men? For certainly a public sign has been done through them, before all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. It is manifest, and we cannot deny it. But lest it spread further among the people, let us threaten them not to speak anymore in this name to any man.” (Acts 4:16-17).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-14' href='#cpdv-verse-11-14'>n</a>. <span> The Antichrist uses threats to try to quiet the worldwide disturbance caused by this event, but to no avail. Many people now realize that the God of Heaven is the Father of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and that the two prophets spoke the truth.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-15' href='#cpdv-verse-11-15'>o</a>. <span> The two prophets are killed at the end of the 1260 days of their prophesying. Then, at the end of the 1290 days, that is, about thirty days after the death of the two prophets, the Antichrist tries to regain the worship of the whole world by requiring them to watch as he makes a fake ascension to heaven. He claims that he is going up to heaven to pursue the two prophets, as if these two were the false ones, as if he were the Son of God.
<br>
“… and he will rise up against the Lord of lords, and he will be knocked down without a hand.” (Dan 8:25).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-16' href='#cpdv-verse-11-16'>p</a>. <span> When he makes his fake ascension, merely rising up into the air, not literally going to Heaven, the whole world watches skeptically. Then the Archangel Michael smothers him and throws him down to the ground, so that he is badly wounded, by not killed. The whole world now realizes that the Antichrist is not a god.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-17' href='#cpdv-verse-11-17'>q</a>. <span> The third woe is the Seven Bowls of God's Wrath, which will be poured out on the unrepentant wicked after the Return of Christ and a space of time for repentance.</span></div>

The one head of the seven that was healed of a mortal wound is the Antichrist, who will be one particular human being, so he is referred to with masculine pronouns. And the false prophet who assists the Antichrist will be a woman, an anti-type of the Virgin Mary. This false prophet is referred to in this translation with feminine pronouns. At times the word ‘beast’ is used to refer to the kingdom of the Antichrist, and at other times the word ‘beast’ is used to refer to the Antichrist himself.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-2' href='#cpdv-verse-13-2'>b</a>. <span> The beast is a kingdom. The sea represents a great sea of people, from many different nations, languages, and cultures.

The kingdom of the ten kings will rule the world for several generations. Then the Antichrist will replace one of the kings (the king of the North, whose kingdom includes part of Europe). Next, the Antichrist defeats three kings. Thus, the kingdom of ten kings becomes ruled by seven heads, i.e. the Antichrist plus the six remaining kings.

The fallen angels are not permitted to have power over men like that of kings. Fallen angels may attempt to influence them, but they cannot take charge of even the most evil kingdom.</span></div>

The world is conquered with force by the Antichrist, but it is also seduced by him into freely choosing evil. After he begins his reign over nearly the whole world, the Antichrist has a mortal wound, inflicted by a weapon, but the mortal wound is healed. This helps him convince people to worship him, so that he does not merely possess political and military power over the world, but is worshiped.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-5' href='#cpdv-verse-13-5'>e</a>. <span> The worship of evil is really a kind of worship of Satan (the dragon). This worship of evil leads to a worship of the kingdom of the Antichrist, the kingdom referred to as the beast, which is strong in promoting evil throughout the world.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-6' href='#cpdv-verse-13-6'>f</a>. <span> The mouth speaking great things is the Antichrist. For the first half of his reign, 42 months, he attempts to force the world to worship him. He uses the force of weapons and unjust law enforcement to try to force people to worship him.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-7' href='#cpdv-verse-13-7'>g</a>. <span> The Antichrist blasphemes against God and attempts to destroy all religion, except the worship of himself. But this is not, at this point in time, an organized religion with ceremonies, etc.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-8' href='#cpdv-verse-13-8'>h</a>. <span> The Antichrist is permitted to use the force of war and battles and weapons to conquer the Church, forbidding the practice of Christianity (and of Judaism, and of Islam) under pain of death. He succeeds in conquering the world by force of arms, but he does not win over their hearts and minds. Even many wicked persons resent the Antichrist and follow him only unwillingly. There are constant attempted rebellions against him.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-9' href='#cpdv-verse-13-9'>i</a>. <span> This is the third time that we are told about this false worship. First, in verse four we are told that they worship the dragon (Satan). Then, in the same verse, we are told that they worship the beast (the kingdom). Now, in this verse, we are told that they worship the person of the Antichrist. Notice that both the kingdom and the leader of that kingdom (the Antichrist) are referred to as the beast. (The pronoun 'eam' in Latin refers to the beast, a word which is feminine in Latin.) The worship of evil (Satan) leads to a worship of the kingdom of the Antichrist (the beast), which leads to a worship of the person of the Antichrist (also called the beast).</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-10' href='#cpdv-verse-13-10'>j</a>. <span> God's Providence permits the Antichrist to have power over nearly the whole world for nearly seven years. Nothing can be done about it. The force of arms will not shorten the Antichrist's reign. Even prayer will not shorten his reign. The time allotted is the time allotted. The Saints must accept captivity and even death, with patient endurance and in true faith.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-11' href='#cpdv-verse-13-11'>k</a>. <span> When a beast symbolically arises from the sea, this refers to a kingdom that arises from the great sea of different peoples and languages and nations. When a beast arises from the land, this refers to one individual human person, because human persons are made from the dust of the earth. This beast is the false prophetess, a woman. The passage about the harlot (feminine) ruling over the world from the city with seven hills (Rome), makes it clear that the false prophet is a woman and an antipope. Also, later in the book, the beast (i.e. the Antichrist) and the false prophet are thrown alive (body and soul) into Hell. If the Antichrist is a perverse imitation of Christ, then the false prophetess is a perverse imitation of the Virgin Mary. Now Christ and Mary are the only two persons in Heaven with both a human body and a human soul. Therefore, the Antichrist and the false prophet are the only two persons in Hell with both a human body and a human soul; one male and one female, like Jesus and Mary in Heaven, like Adam and Eve in Paradise. All this indicates clearly that the false prophet is really a false prophetess.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-12' href='#cpdv-verse-13-12'>l</a>. <span> For the first half of his reign, the Antichrist attempted to use force to obtain the worshipful obedience of the world. But all he obtained was an unwilling external obedience; few persons worshipped him willingly. Now, in the last half of his reign, the false prophetess assists the Antichrist in obtaining the worship that he desires. She convinces the Antichrist to use false doctrines and a perverse version of Catholic Christianity to seduce the minds and hearts of the people of the world. Formerly, the Antichrist sought to be worshiped, but without ceremonies and formal doctrines and an institutional church. Now all the peoples of the world are pressured into joining in this false worship. Formerly closed Catholic churches are reopened and dedicated to this new evil purpose; new churches are built for this false worship. The false prophetess is a woman antipope, who uses false teachings and a perverse version of every Sacrament of Catholicism to try to convince the world to worship the Antichrist. She uses the healing of the Antichrist's wound to claim that he is the Messiah, as if his healing from a deadly wound were analogous (perversely) to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. But they deny that Jesus Christ came as God Incarnate.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-13' href='#cpdv-verse-13-13'>m</a>. <span> She is assisted by fallen angels in producing great signs and wonders. This is one of the reasons why the Antichrist agrees to her plan to seduce the world with a perverse version of Catholicism, because she can perform signs and wonders, and she promises that he will be able to do the same.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-14' href='#cpdv-verse-13-14'>n</a>. <span> She now sets up various aspects of Catholicism, perverted to this evil worship of the Antichrist, such as icons (religious images) and false versions of the Sacraments, including, most horrifically, a perverse version of the Eucharist, that Most Blessed Sacrament, which in its perverse invalid form is called the abomination of desolation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-15' href='#cpdv-verse-13-15'>o</a>. <span> The world is forced to join in this false worship, under pain of death. Many true worshipers of God will be put to death at this time, including Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The image of the beast is given the ability to produce false signs and wonders by means of fallen angels.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-16' href='#cpdv-verse-13-16'>p</a>. <span> The mark of the beast is used to force the worship of the Antichrist, so that no one may obtain the necessities of life without assenting to this false worship. In that future time, faithful Christians are permitted to expropriate the goods that they need to survive; this is not stealing and is not immoral.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-13-17' href='#cpdv-verse-13-17'>q</a>. <span> The number is the name of the Antichrist. His name has six letters in his first name, six letters in his middle name, and six letters in his last name. Some ancient manuscripts have the number as 616, which stands for the six letters in his first name, the one letter of his middle initial, and the six letters in his last name. This is the correct interpretation because it fits the chapter and verse numbers: 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 and 6 + 6 + 6 = 18; the chapter is 13 and the verse is 18. Furthermore, the number 600, written in Aramaic, is written as 400-200 (the character for 400 and the character for 200 joined together), therefore, one of his names (the first or the last?) will have the six letters separated by a hyphen: 4 letters - 2 letters.</span></div>

In my opinion, the 12 thousand stadia is related to the 12 sections of the wall, so the perimeter is 12 thousand stadia; this interpretation makes the latter part of the verse much more significant, in that it is needed to indicate that the length and height are equal (so 3 thousand stadia each), and that the height is therefore also 3 thousand stadia.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-22-1' href='#cpdv-verse-22-1'>a</a>. <span> The text literally says ‘for each month offering its fruit,’ but the meaning is that of one fruit per month, 12 fruits, one per month. And health is not merely healing of disease or injury; health can refer to what which prevents disease or injury, or to that which maintains health.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-22-2' href='#cpdv-verse-22-2'>b</a>. <span> The word ‘venefici’ literally, in ancient times, referred to those who engaged in magical or occult practices, including mixing various potions, drugs, and poisons; it also was used to refer to those who made poisons, and to those who made drugs of various kinds. In the modern context, this term has little meaning if translated as ‘sorcerers.’ It is best translated by reference to those persons in modern times who use, promote, or distribute immoral drugs (legal or illegal), such as: chemical contraceptives, drugs of abuse, recreational drugs, abuse of prescription drugs, etc.
<br>
This verse was changed 2021/02/17 so that venefici was changed from "drug users" to "drug abusers", and impudici was changed from "homosexuals" to "the unchaste". The word impudici can refer to homosexuals or homosexuality, but in this context it probably has the broader meaning of everyone who is unchaste (including both homosexual and heterosexual grave sexual sins).</span></div>
