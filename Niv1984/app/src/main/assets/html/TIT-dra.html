<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love in patience.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.</span></div>
<div class='verse'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</span></div>
