<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-2-1-1'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-3-1-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-4-1-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-5-1-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-6-1-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-7-1-6'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-8-1-7'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-9-1-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-10-1-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-11-1-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-12-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-13-1-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-14-1-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-15-1-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-16-1-15'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-17-1-16'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-22-2-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-23-2-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-24-2-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-27-2-8'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-28-2-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-29-2-10'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-30-2-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-31-2-12'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-32-2-13'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-33-2-14'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-38-3-2'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-39-3-3'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-40-3-4'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-41-3-5'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='dra-bookmark-45-3-9'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</span></div>
