<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Tobit was from the tribe and city of Naphtali (which is in the upper parts of Galilee above Asher, after the way, which leads to the west, that has on its left the city of Sephet).</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Although he had been taken captive in the days of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, even in such a situation as captivity, he did not desert the way of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So then, every day, all that he was able to obtain, he bestowed on his fellow captive brothers, who were from his kindred.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And, when he was among the youngest of any in the tribe of Naphtali, he showed not so much as any childish behavior in his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And then, when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made, he alone fled from the company of them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet he continued on to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord, and there he adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his first-fruits and his tithes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So then, in the third year, he administered all his tithes to new converts and to new arrivals.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Truly, when he had become a man, he received as wife Anna of his own tribe, and he conceived a son by her, to whom he assigned his own name.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-13'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-3" id="cpdv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>From his infancy, he taught him to fear God and to abstain from all sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, when, during the captivity, he had arrived with his wife and son at the city of Nineveh, with all his tribe,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>(even though they all ate from the foods of the Gentiles,) he guarded his soul and never was contaminated with their foods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And because he was mindful of the Lord with his whole heart, God gave him favor in the sight of Shalmaneser the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he gave him the power to go wherever he would want, having the freedom to do whatever he wished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Therefore, he continued on to all who were in captivity, and he gave them helpful advice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when he had arrived at Rages, a city of the Medes, he had ten talents of silver, from that which he had been given in honor by the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And when, in the midst of the great tumult of his kindred, he saw the destitution of Gabael, who was from his tribe, he loaned him, under a written agreement, the aforementioned weight of silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>In truth, after a long time, Shalmaneser the king died, while Sennacherib his son reigned in his place, and he held a hatred for the sons of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Every day, Tobit traveled through all his own people, and he consoled them, and he distributed to each one as much as he could from his resources.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He nourished the hungry, and he supplied clothes to the naked, and he showed concern for the burial of the dead and of the slain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And then, when king Sennacherib had returned from Judea, fleeing the scourge which God had caused all around him because of his blasphemy, and, being angry, he was slaughtering many from the sons of Israel, Tobit buried their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And when it was reported to the king, he ordered him to be slain, and he took away all his belongings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>In truth, Tobit, fleeing with nothing but his son and his wife, was able to remain hidden because many loved him.</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-28'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-1-4" id="cpdv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>In truth, after forty-five days, the king was slain by his own sons,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>and Tobit was able to return to his house, and all his resources were restored to him.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-31'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> The Latin text plainly says that Sephet is on the ‘left,’ but the Challoner and the Douay-Rheims versions have this as on the ‘right.’ The Wycliffe version has it as ‘the left.’</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> In this context, the new arrivals would refer not merely to any stranger or foreigner, but to those who were a new arrival to Jerusalem, who were there to inquire about the Jewish faith. And the new converts would be those one step further in the process of becoming a Jew. The word ‘ministraret’ indicates that Tobit did not merely give away his tithes, but he applied them judiciously to particular persons and circumstances, as needed.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Since Tobit and his son have the same name, editors of various Bible editions have introduced variations on the name, so as to distinguish between the father and his son. In this translation, the father is called ‘Tobit,’ and his son is called, ‘Tobias.’ But actually, they have the same name.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> The word ‘nudus’ in this context does not mean that Tobit was naked, but that he fled with nothing of his possessions, but only with his wife and son.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-32'>Tobit 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In truth, after this, when there was a feast day of the Lord, and a good dinner had been prepared in the house of Tobit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>he said to his son: “Go, and bring some others who fear God from our tribe to feast with us.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And after he had gone, returning, he reported to him that one of the sons of Israel, with his throat cut, was lying in the street. And immediately, he leapt from his place reclining at table, left behind his dinner, and went forth with fasting to the body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And taking it up, he carried it in secret to his house, so that, after the sun had set, he might bury him cautiously.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And after he had hidden the body, he chewed his bread with mourning and fear,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>remembering the word that the Lord spoke through the prophet Amos: “Your feast days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Truly, when the sun had set, he went out, and he buried him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Yet all his neighbors argued with him, saying: “Now, an order was given to execute you because of this matter, and you barely escaped a death sentence, and again you are burying the dead?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Tobit, fearing God more than the king, stole away the bodies of the slain and concealed them in his house, and in the middle of the night, he buried them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But it happened one day, being tired from burying the dead, he came into his house, and he threw himself down next to the wall, and he slept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And, as he was sleeping, warm droppings from a swallow’s nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And so the Lord permitted this trial to befall him, in order that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, which is even like that of holy Job.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For, even from his infancy, he had always feared God and kept his commandments, so he was not discouraged before God because of the scourge of blindness that had befallen him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But he remained immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For just as kings have mocked blessed Job, so also his relatives and acquaintances ridiculed his life, saying:</span></div>
<div class='fragment' id='cpdv-bookmark-48'><sup>[<a href="#cpdv-footnote-2-1" id="cpdv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>“Where is your hope, on behalf of which you gave alms and buried the dead?”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In truth, Tobit corrected them, saying: “Do not speak in this way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>for we are the sons of the holy ones, and we look forward to that life which God will give to those who never change in their faith before him.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>In truth, his wife Anna went out to weaving work daily, and she brought back the provisions that she was able to obtain by the labor of her hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Whereupon it happened that, having received a young goat, she brought it home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When her husband heard the sound of its bleating, he said, “Look, so that it might not be stolen, return it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat, or to touch, anything stolen.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>At this, his wife, being angry, answered, “Clearly, your hope has become vanity, and the manner of your almsgiving has become apparent.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And with these and other similar such words, she reproached him.</span></div>
<div id='cpdv-bookmark-57'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-1' href='#cpdv-verse-2-1'>a</a>. <span> In this context, parentes is more general than the English word ‘parents,’ encompassing his parents, grandparents, and probably any older relatives of previous generations who would see Tobit as subordinate to them. The word ‘cognati’ refers even more generally to people knew Tobit, such as friends and acquaintances. It can also be used as one word referring to both relatives and friends.</span></div>

<h2 id='cpdv-bookmark-58'>Tobit 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Tobit sighed, and he began to pray with tears,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>saying, “O Lord, you are just and all your judgments are just, and all your ways are mercy, and truth, and judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And now, O Lord, remember me, and do not take vengeance for my sins, and do not call to mind my offenses, nor those of my parents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For we have not obeyed your precepts, and so we have been handed over to plundering and to captivity, and to death, and to mockery, and as a disgrace before all the nations, among which you have dispersed us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now, O Lord, great are your judgments. For we have not acted according to your precepts, and we have not walked sincerely before you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And now, O Lord, do with me according to your will, and order my spirit to be received in peace. For it is more expedient for me to die, than to live.”</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And so, on the same day, it happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in Rages, a city of the Medes, also heard a reproach from one of her father’s servant maids.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For she had been given to seven husbands, and a demon named Asmodeus had killed them, as soon as they had approached her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Therefore, when she corrected the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying, “May we never see son or daughter from you upon the earth, you murderess of your husbands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Would you also kill me, just as you have already killed seven husbands?” At these words, she proceeded to an upper room of her house. And for three days and three nights, she did not eat or drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But, continuing in prayer with tears, she beseeched God, so that he would liberate her from this reproach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And it happened on the third day, while she was completing her prayer, blessing the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>that she said: “Blessed is your name, O God of our fathers, who, though you had been angry, will show mercy. And in time of tribulation, you dismiss the sins of those who call upon you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>I beg you, O Lord, that you may absolve me from the chains of this reproach, or at least take me away from the earth.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-1' href='#cpdv-verse-6-1'>a</a>. <span> The word ‘palpitare’ can refer to throbbing, beating, or pulsating; but in this context, it means that the fish was thrashing back and forth on the ground.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-2' href='#cpdv-verse-6-2'>b</a>. <span> This action of taking a fish and dividing it into parts is very similar to the various Old Testament animal sacrifices, which of course have a symbolic meaning. The term 'heart' is still used today in modern English as a symbol. Similarly, the parts of the fish have symbolic meanings. The smoke symbolizes prayer. The heart symbolizes a pure love for God and neighbor. The liver symbolizes the removal of sin from one's life (the liver removes toxins from the body). The gall symbolizes the suffering of self-denial and the healthful effects on the soul of that suffering (since gall is bitter, but was used as a medicine in ancient times). So the parts of the fish represent useful medicines for the soul.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-3' href='#cpdv-verse-6-3'>c</a>. <span> The Latin word ‘substantia’ is often translated as substance, but it refers to the necessary belongings, or, as in this case, the things that constitute one’s livelihood.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-4' href='#cpdv-verse-6-4'>d</a>. <span> In some contexts, ‘infernos’ refers to Hell, but in other contexts it merely refers to death or to the grave or to death under adverse circumstances.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-5' href='#cpdv-verse-6-5'>e</a>. <span> The word ‘incenso’ refers to burning something, and, in this context, it calls to mind the burning of incense. So the translation is to burn like incense: somewhat awkward, but more accurate. The first night of continence is to dispel the demons of lust and selfishness.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-6-6' href='#cpdv-verse-6-6'>f</a>. <span> The second night of continence is to prepare the husband and wife to be ready to receive the type of physical union (marital relations) that the holy Patriarchs had in their marriages. In other words, Tobias and Sarah would become able to have sexual relations within a devout marriage, out of love for one another and for God, and with faithfulness to one another and to God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-336'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And so, having completed one hundred and two years, he was buried honorably at Nineveh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-337'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For he was fifty-six years old, when he lost the light of his eyes, and he was sixty years old, when he truly received it again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-338'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And, in truth, the remainder of his life was in gladness. And so, with the good accomplishment of the fear of God, he departed in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-339'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But, in the hour of his death, he called to himself his son Tobias, along with his sons, the seven youths who were his grandsons, and he said to them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>“Nineveh will pass away soon. For the word of the Lord goes forward, and our brothers, who have been dispersed away from the land of Israel, shall return to it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And it happened that, after the death of his mother, Tobias withdrew from Nineveh, with his wife, and sons, and sons of sons, and he was returned to his father-in-law.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-1' href='#cpdv-verse-14-1'>a</a>. <span> The verb ‘excidit’ literally means ‘falls out.’ It is sometimes used to refer to an event that must befall someone, usually an event of destruction or disaster.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-2' href='#cpdv-verse-14-2'>b</a>. <span> The phrasing ‘omnis...replebitur’ means to be entirely filled up again.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-14-3' href='#cpdv-verse-14-3'>c</a>. <span> Notice that the word ‘generatio’ is used to refer to lineage, rather than to the members of one time period (generation). Similarly, when Christ said that ‘this generation’ would not pass away until all was accomplished, he meant ‘this lineage,’ in other words, the human race. He was not saying that the people of that time period would see everything accomplished in their lifetime.</span></div>
