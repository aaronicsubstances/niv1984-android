<div class='verse' id='cpdv-bookmark-16-1-11'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore, keep yourselves from complaining, which benefits nothing, and refrain your tongue from slander, because secret conversation will not pass into nothingness, and the mouth that lies kills the soul.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-1' href='#cpdv-verse-1-1'>a</a>. <span> Diligite can also mean choose, terram means land, whereas orbis terram would mean earth, or, literally, the circle of lands.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-2' href='#cpdv-verse-1-2'>b</a>. <span> Virtus can refer to either power or virtue; when used about God it should be understood to mean both, for in God virtue is power and power is virtue. God is one.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-3' href='#cpdv-verse-1-3'>c</a>. <span> Disciplinae can mean discipline or instruction or teaching or training, or perhaps all those things put together.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-4' href='#cpdv-verse-1-4'>d</a>. <span> Literally, the text refers to kidneys, heart, and tongue. The reader will understand that the meaning of heart in this context is something like inner most being. Likewise, the word tongue is used metaphorically to refer to words or speaking. The kidneys, in ancient times, also had a metaphorical meaning, which refers to temperament. On the positive side, kidneys are a metaphor for patience and self-restraint. On the negative side, it refers to losing one’s temper and to temperament in general as a point of vulnerability.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-5' href='#cpdv-verse-1-5'>e</a>. <span> Sanabiles means curable, but it could also be translated as savable. As in other verses, medicine here has a negative connotation. Inferorum literally means below or the underworld, but it is often used to refer to hell.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-1-6' href='#cpdv-verse-1-6'>f</a>. <span> Latin uses many different pronouns very frequently. Pronouns in Latin have case, gender, and are singular or plural. When translated into English, there are fewer pronouns and fewer forms of each pronoun. Therefore, so that some meaning will not be lost in translation, sometimes the noun the pronoun refers to is used in the English translation. Illam refers to death, continuing the theme of the previous verses.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-3' href='#cpdv-verse-2-3'>c</a>. <span> Flos temporis uses flower metaphorically, to refer to human persons, so the translation is flower of youth, rather than flower of time. Here and in the subsequent verses the misuse of sexuality is implied.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-4' href='#cpdv-verse-2-4'>d</a>. <span> Again, the metaphor of flowers, and also of a meadow, are used to refer to persons who are sexually promiscuous.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-2-8' href='#cpdv-verse-2-8'>h</a>. <span> These verses refer to Christ, so the use of immutable, a word aptly applied to God, makes a fitting translation.</span></div>

Thus, novissima often refers to the last or the end of something. In this case, though, it has both meanings. It means the newest to be justified or to converted or to repent, and it also refers metaphorically to the newest among the just as if they were the newest recruits.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-1' href='#cpdv-verse-3-1'>a</a>. <span> Exterminium can mean extermination as in utter destruction, but it can also mean banishment, a more mild term.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-2' href='#cpdv-verse-3-2'>b</a>. <span> Bene disponentur means well compensated, or well ordered, or well administered, i.e., they will be well cared for.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-3' href='#cpdv-verse-3-3'>c</a>. <span> Holocaust, in the biblical sense, refers to a sacrifice or offering that is entirely burned up, a burnt offering.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-4' href='#cpdv-verse-3-4'>d</a>. <span> The Latin text here (3:6-7) has been corrected against the Greek text, according to the appendix of the 1914 Hetzenauer edition of the Vulgate. Instead of saying, “in time they will be respected. The just will shine...” the Greek text has one sentence, “in the time of their visitation, they will shine...” This reading is better, because it explains when and why the just will shine and dash about. It is because, the time of their visitation has arrived, when God visits them to vindicate them over their enemies.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-5' href='#cpdv-verse-3-5'>e</a>. <span> Here the Vulgate text has been amended, taking the beginning of verse 3:13, maledicta creatura eorum, and making it the end of verse 12. This phrase is clearly a continuation of the afflictions upon those who abandon wisdom and on their hope, their labors, their works, their wives, their sons, and their servants. The phrase maledicta creatura eorum could be translated as their creations are accursed, but their works have already been condemned as useless in verse 11. Therefore, servants or, better still, the things that serve them, is the translation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-6' href='#cpdv-verse-3-6'>f</a>. <span> This verse begins to explain the contrast between those who abandon wisdom and those who take it to heart. Felix could be translated as happy, but this passage uses the metaphor of bearing fruit repeatedly, so the better translation is fertile. Thus, the unwise do not bear useful fruit, but the wise will bear fruit, even if they are celibate and never bear the fruit of having children.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-7' href='#cpdv-verse-3-7'>g</a>. <span> Spado is best translated as celibate, as the context clearly indicates. The word eunuch is a poor translation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-3-8' href='#cpdv-verse-3-8'>h</a>. <span> The expression “son of...” in Hebrew is often used metaphorically. The “sons of the priests” are priests in training, not necessarily the offspring of the Jewish priests. The expression “son of a year” means a one-year old; “son of perdition” means someone who is lost; “son of death” means someone who has died, or a dead body. In other words, the “son” is the metaphorical offspring of a particular group or concept, regardless of his biological lineage. So the expression “sons of adulterers” could be translated as the sons of adultery, i.e., those who act as if they were the offspring of adultery.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-7-7' href='#cpdv-verse-7-7'>g</a>. <span> Ancient Latin had no punctuation, no spaces between words, and no difference between capital and small letters. So, does the text say: “gracious, loving good, astute, which nothing hinders, beneficial,” (as some have it), or does it say: “gracious, loving, good, astute, who forbids nothing beneficial,” (as this version has it)? Later editors added the commas, which make all the difference. But, since the text is first a series of one-word descriptors of wisdom, the comma between amans and bonum makes more sense, translated as “loving, good” rather than “loving good,” although both are obviously true of wisdom. On the other hand, “who forbids nothing” does not fit wisdom, for wisdom does forbid what is evil, what is vain, what is harmful, what is useless, etc. Therefore, the translation is “who forbids nothing beneficial.” Some translations have rendered “quem nihil vetat” as “irresistible,” i.e. “which nothing forbids, beneficial,” but this seems a less likely meaning of the text.</span></div>

The word assisto in Latin refers to someone who stands nearby, with more of a meaning of attending or waiting on someone greater (in this case, God), rather than a meaning of assistant, in the modern sense. Handmaiden works well as a translation because it is feminine, indicates serving or waiting upon someone who is in much higher position, and as handmaiden, rather than handmaid, it implies virginity. The assistricem is wisdom, but the Virgin Mary is in some ways also referred to here, since she is the seat of wisdom.</span></div>

<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-11-2' href='#cpdv-verse-11-2'>b</a>. <span> The corruption of the drinking water refers to one of the plagues God sent through Moses against the Egyptians (Exodus 7:16-21). The drinking water of the Egyptians was turned to blood and so became undrinkable.

<div id='cpdv-bookmark-380-n'>
<hr>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-1' href='#cpdv-verse-12-1'>a</a>. <span> The word partibus means part or region or direction, but paired with exerrant it means to wander off-course or to wander afield.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-2' href='#cpdv-verse-12-2'>b</a>. <span> Here again is a mention of medicine used in a negative connotation.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-3' href='#cpdv-verse-12-3'>c</a>. <span> The phrase “devoratores sanguinis a medio sacramento tuo” is difficult. The first two words clearly mean devourers of blood, and sacramento can mean mystery or sacrament. The phrasing “a medio” seems, at first glance, to mean “in the middle,” but medio can also mean common or community and “a” can mean “apart from,” “away from,” or even “in opposition to.” This translation sees meaning which applies the text to the future Christian Church, more so than to the history of the Jewish faith. At times, the book of Wisdom is clearly talking about the past, at other times, it seems just as clearly to refer to future times, even to the end times.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-4' href='#cpdv-verse-12-4'>d</a>. <span> Often mistranslated, “auctores parentes,” in this context does not specifically mean parents, but rather the performing of a ceremony or religious rite (used here with a negative connotation). Originally, the word was used to refer to ceremonies commemorating dead parents or dead ancestors, but in this context it seems to have a wider meaning. The phrase “auctores parentes” refers to those who are sellers of a certain type of ceremony related to helpless souls. Again, while this may have an historical meaning, it also has points to future times.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-5' href='#cpdv-verse-12-5'>e</a>. <span> The word charior is made comparative by the addition of the letter “i” and so is translated as more beloved or most beloved. Terra is singular, feminine, and ablative in case, so the meaning is “in the land.” And quae is singular, feminine, and nominative in case, so quae or “which” (referring to the land) is the subject of the verb “est.” Notice the use of the word puerorum to mean children, rather than filiorum, which would mean sons.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-6' href='#cpdv-verse-12-6'>f</a>. <span> Here is an interesting play on words, in the Latin, which is not (as far as I know) found in the Hebrew or the Greek. The wasps are said to be forerunners of God’s army, but the word army in Latin, exercitus, can also mean swarm, as in a swarm of insects.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-7' href='#cpdv-verse-12-7'>g</a>. <span> This difficult verse has been translated somewhat loosely. More literally, it says: “For you reveal power (virtue), you who are not believed to be in power perfect (or complete), and those who do not know you, you boldly expose in disgrace.”</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-8' href='#cpdv-verse-12-8'>h</a>. <span> The expression bonarum promissionum literally means good promises, but here it obviously has a less literal meaning: in good faith.</span></div>
<div><a id='cpdv-footnote-12-9' href='#cpdv-verse-12-9'>i</a>. <span> The phrase finis condemnationis by itself, might seem to mean final condemnation. But, in this context, as a consequence of acknowledging the true God, it must mean the end of their condemnation. Also, condemnationis eorum is of the genitive case and so it means “of their condemnation.” And venit super tends more towards “came upon them,” as opposed to supervenit, which would mean “overcame them” and would be more fitting if the meaning were final condemnation.</span></div>

Therefore, the text is not merely referring to adultery or to sexual sins, but to unnatural adultery and to unnatural sexual sins. Impudicitiae, by itself, can mean homosexuality, but when paired with inordinatio (unnatural), it more clearly has the meaning of condemning homosexuality as unnatural.

But notice that the first part of the word is animae, meaning soul. So, a good translation in a religious context is “more calm in soul” or “more peaceful in soul.”</span></div>
