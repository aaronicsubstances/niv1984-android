<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness </span><i>was</i><span> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>And God saw the light, that </span><i>it was</i><span> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which </span><i>were</i><span> under the firmament from the waters which </span><i>were</i><span> above the firmament: and it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry </span><i>land</i><span> appear: and it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>And God called the dry </span><i>land</i><span> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that </span><i>it was</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, </span><i>and</i><span> the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed </span><i>is</i><span> in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And the earth brought forth grass, </span><i>and</i><span> herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed </span><i>was</i><span> in itself, after his kind: and God saw that </span><i>it was</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: </span><i>he made</i><span> the stars also.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl </span><i>that</i><span> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that </span><i>it was</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that </span><i>it was</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>So God created man in his </span><i>own</i><span> image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which </span><i>is</i><span> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which </span><i>is</i><span> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, </span><i>it was</i><span> very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[6] <span>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[20] <span>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1619'>[13] <span>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1620'>[14] <span>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1621'>[15] <span>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1622'>[16] <span>And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1623'>[17] <span>So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1624'>[18] <span>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we </span><i>be</i><span> thy servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1625'>[19] <span>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for </span><i>am</i><span> I in the place of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1626'>[20] <span>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; </span><i>but</i><span> God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as </span><i>it is</i><span> this day, to save much people alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1627'>[21] <span>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1628'>[22] <span>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1629'>[23] <span>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third </span><i>generation</i><span>: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1630'>[24] <span>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1631'>[25] <span>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1632'>[26] <span>So Joseph died, </span><i>being</i><span> an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span></div>
