<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. </span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>These </span><i>are</i><span> the generations of Jacob. Joseph, </span><i>being</i><span> seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad </span><i>was</i><span> with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-1" id="niv-verse-37-1">1</a>]</sup><span> robe for him.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he </span><i>was</i><span> the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of </span><i>many</i><span> colours.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told </span><i>it</i><span> his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For, behold, we </span><i>were</i><span> binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he told </span><i>it</i><span> to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What </span><i>is</i><span> this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed </span><i>the flock</i><span> in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here </span><i>am I</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And a certain man found him, and, behold, </span><i>he was</i><span> wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed </span><i>their flocks</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, `Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Reuben heard </span><i>it</i><span>, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, </span><i>but</i><span> cast him into this pit that </span><i>is</i><span> in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing--</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, </span><i>his</i><span> coat of </span><i>many</i><span> colours that </span><i>was</i><span> on him;</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit </span><i>was</i><span> empty, </span><i>there was</i><span> no water in it.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry </span><i>it</i><span> down to Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit </span><i>is it</i><span> if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he </span><i>is</i><span> our brother </span><i>and</i><span> our flesh. And his brethren were content.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-2" id="niv-verse-37-2">2</a>]</sup><span> of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph </span><i>was</i><span> not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child </span><i>is</i><span> not; and I, whither shall I go?</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they sent the coat of </span><i>many</i><span> colours, and they brought </span><i>it</i><span> to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it </span><i>be</i><span> thy son's coat or no.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he knew it, and said, </span><i>It is</i><span> my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-3" id="niv-verse-37-3">3</a>]</sup><span> to my son." So his father wept for him.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Meanwhile, the Midianites </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-4" id="niv-verse-37-4">4</a>]</sup><span> sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, `There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'"</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When she </span><i>was</i><span> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these </span><i>are, am</i><span> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose </span><i>are</i><span> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Judah acknowledged </span><i>them</i><span>, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins </span><i>were</i><span> in her womb.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 43</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the famine was still severe in the land.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the famine </span><i>was</i><span> sore in the land.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother </span><i>be</i><span> with you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if thou wilt not send </span><i>him</i><span>, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother </span><i>be</i><span> with you.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye </span><i>so</i><span> ill with me, </span><i>as</i><span> to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. `Is your father still living?' he asked us. `Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, `Bring your brother down here'?"</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, </span><i>Is</i><span> your father yet alive? have ye </span><i>another</i><span> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, </span><i>and</i><span> also our little ones.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice."</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And their father Israel said unto them, If </span><i>it must be</i><span> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry </span><i>it</i><span> again in your hand; peradventure it </span><i>was</i><span> an oversight:</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And may God Almighty </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-43-1" id="niv-verse-43-1">1</a>]</sup><span> grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved."</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved </span><i>of my children</i><span>, I am bereaved.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at noon."</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring </span><i>these</i><span> men home, and slay, and make ready; for </span><i>these</i><span> men shall dine with me at noon.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys."</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Please, sir," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver--the exact weight--in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, </span><i>every</i><span> man's money </span><i>was</i><span> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don't know who put our silver in our sacks."</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Peace </span><i>be</i><span> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave </span><i>them</i><span> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which </span><i>was</i><span> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?"</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he asked them of </span><i>their</i><span> welfare, and said, </span><i>Is</i><span> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? </span><i>Is</i><span> he yet alive?</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They replied, "Your servant our father is still alive and well." And they bowed low to pay him honor.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they answered, Thy servant our father </span><i>is</i><span> in good health, he </span><i>is</i><span> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, </span><i>Is</i><span> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought </span><i>where</i><span> to weep; and he entered into </span><i>his</i><span> chamber, and wept there.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food."</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that </span><i>is</i><span> an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he took </span><i>and sent</i><span> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span></div>
