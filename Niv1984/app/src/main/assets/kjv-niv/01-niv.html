<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now the earth was </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And there was evening, and there was morning--the third day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>God made two great lights--the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And there was evening, and there was morning--the fourth day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and over all the creatures that move along the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." And it was so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> from all his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and there was no man to work the ground,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>but streams </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>the LORD God formed the man </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground--trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and onyx are also there.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-7" id="niv-verse-2-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-8" id="niv-verse-2-8">h</a>]</sup><span> no suitable helper was found.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-9" id="niv-verse-2-9">i</a>]</sup><span> and closed up the place with flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-10" id="niv-verse-2-10">j</a>]</sup><span> he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called `woman, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-11" id="niv-verse-2-11">k</a>]</sup><span> ' for she was taken out of man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, `You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> his daughters.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> please!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-861'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"We can't," they replied, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-862'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-921'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>"What shall I give you?" he asked. "Don't give me anything," Jacob replied. "But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-922'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-923'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-924'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"Agreed," said Laban. "Let it be as you have said."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-925'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-926'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-927'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-928'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-929'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-930'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-931'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-932'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-933'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-935'>Chapter 31</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-936'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-937'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-938'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-939'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-940'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-941'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-942'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-943'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>If he said, `The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, `The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-944'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-945'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-946'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The angel of God said to me in the dream, `Jacob.' I answered, `Here I am.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-947'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he said, `Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-948'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-949'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-950'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-951'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-952'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-953'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-1" id="niv-verse-31-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-954'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-955'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-956'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So he fled with all he had, and crossing the River, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-2" id="niv-verse-31-2">b</a>]</sup><span> he headed for the hill country of Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-957'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-958'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-959'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-960'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-961'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-962'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-963'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by. You have done a foolish thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-964'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, `Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-965'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-966'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-967'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-968'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-969'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-970'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-971'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-972'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-973'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>"I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-974'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-975'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-976'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-977'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-978'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-979'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-980'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-981'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-982'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-3" id="niv-verse-31-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and Jacob called it Galeed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-4" id="niv-verse-31-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-983'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-984'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>It was also called Mizpah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-5" id="niv-verse-31-5">e</a>]</sup><span> because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-985'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-986'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-987'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-988'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-989'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-999'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-2" id="niv-verse-32-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1000'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-3" id="niv-verse-32-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the group </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-4" id="niv-verse-32-4">d</a>]</sup><span> that is left may escape."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1001'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, `Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1005'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1009'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, `To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1010'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>then you are to say, `They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1011'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1158'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1159'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1160'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-1" id="niv-verse-37-1">a</a>]</sup><span> robe for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1161'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1162'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1163'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1164'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1165'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1166'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1167'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1168'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1169'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1170'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1171'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1172'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1173'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1174'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, `Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1175'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1176'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1177'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1178'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1179'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1180'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1181'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1182'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1183'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1184'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1185'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-2" id="niv-verse-37-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1186'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1187'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1188'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1189'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1190'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1191'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1228'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1229'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1232'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1233'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So he left in Joseph's care everything he had; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1278'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1337'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1338'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1339'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1340'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1341'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1342'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1343'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1344'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1345'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1346'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1347'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1348'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1349'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1350'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1351'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1352'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1353'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he put them all in custody for three days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1354'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1355'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1356'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1357'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1358'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1359'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1360'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1361'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1362'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1363'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1364'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1365'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1366'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>"The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1367'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But we said to him, `We are honest men; we are not spies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1368'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1369'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>"Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, `This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1370'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1371'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1372'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1378'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1379'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1381'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1382'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1383'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. `Is your father still living?' he asked us. `Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, `Bring your brother down here'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1384'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1385'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1386'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1387'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1388'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1389'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1390'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And may God Almighty </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-43-1" id="niv-verse-43-1">a</a>]</sup><span> grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1391'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1392'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at noon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1393'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1394'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1395'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1396'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Please, sir," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1397'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver--the exact weight--in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1400'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1401'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1402'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1403'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1405'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1406'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1407'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1408'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1409'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1410'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1536'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1537'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1538'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children."</span></div>
