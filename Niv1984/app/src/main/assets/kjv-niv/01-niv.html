</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>Now the earth was 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_487482367_1">1</a>]</sup> formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>And there was evening, and there was morning--the third day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>God made two great lights--the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>And there was evening, and there was morning--the fourth day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'>And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'>And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-1-26'>Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_487482367_2">2</a>]</sup> and over all the creatures that move along the ground."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-1-27'>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-1-28'>God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-1-29'>Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-1-30'>And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." And it was so.

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.

<h3>Genesis 19</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-19-1'>The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-19-2'>"My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning." "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-19-3'>But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-19-4'>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-19-5'>They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-19-6'>Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-19-7'>and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-19-8'>Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-19-9'>"Get out of our way," they replied. And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-19-10'>But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-19-11'>Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-19-12'>The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here--sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-19-13'>because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-19-14'>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_1">1</a>]</sup> his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-19-15'>With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-19-16'>When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-19-17'>As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-19-18'>But Lot said to them, "No, my lords,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-19-19'>Your

<sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_5">5</a>]</sup> have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-19-20'>Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it--it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-19-21'>He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-19-22'>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_6">6</a>]</sup> )
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-19-23'>By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-19-24'>Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah--from the LORD out of the heavens.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-19-25'>Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities--and also the vegetation in the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-19-26'>But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-19-27'>Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-19-28'>He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-19-29'>So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-19-30'>Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-19-31'>One day the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-19-32'>Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-19-33'>That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-19-34'>The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-19-35'>So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-19-36'>So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-19-37'>The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-19-38'>The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi

<h3>Genesis 22</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-22-1'>Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-22-2'>Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-22-3'>Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-22-4'>On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-22-5'>He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-22-6'>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-22-7'>Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-22-8'>Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-22-9'>When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-22-10'>Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-22-11'>But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-22-12'>"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-22-13'>Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_1">1</a>]</sup> caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-22-14'>So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-22-15'>The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-22-16'>and said, "I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,

<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-22-17'>I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,

<h3>Genesis 24</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-24-1'>Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-24-2'>He said to the chief 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup> servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-24-3'>I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-24-4'>but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-24-5'>The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-24-6'>"Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-24-7'>"The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, `To your offspring

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-24-8'>If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-24-9'>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-24-10'>Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_3">3</a>]</sup> and made his way to the town of Nahor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-24-11'>He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-24-12'>Then he prayed, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-24-13'>See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-24-14'>May it be that when I say to a girl, `Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, `Drink, and I'll water your camels too'--let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-24-15'>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-24-16'>The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-24-17'>The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-24-18'>"Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-24-19'>After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-24-20'>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-24-21'>Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-24-22'>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka

<sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_5">5</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-24-23'>Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-24-24'>She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-24-25'>And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-24-26'>Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-24-27'>saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-24-28'>The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-24-29'>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-24-30'>As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-24-31'>"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-24-32'>So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-24-33'>Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," [Laban] said.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-24-46'>"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, `Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-24-47'>"I asked her, `Whose daughter are you?' "She said, `The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-24-49'>Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-24-50'>Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.

<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-24-51'>Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-24-52'>When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-24-53'>Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-26-7'>When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-26-8'>When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-26-9'>So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, `She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-26-12'>Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.

<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-26-23'>From there he went up to Beersheba.

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-29-3'>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-29-4'>Jacob asked the shepherds, "My brothers, where are you from?" "We're from Haran," they replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-29-5'>He said to them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" "Yes, we know him," they answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-29-6'>Then Jacob asked them, "Is he well?" "Yes, he is," they said, "and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-29-7'>"Look," he said, "the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-29-8'>"We can't," they replied, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-29-9'>While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-29-10'>When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep.

<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-29-11'>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-29-12'>He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-29-13'>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-29-14'>Then Laban said to him, "You are my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-29-15'>Laban said to him, "Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-29-16'>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-29-17'>Leah had weak

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-29-25'>When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-29-30'>Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-29-33'>She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon.

<h3>Genesis 31</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-31-1'>Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-31-2'>And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-31-3'>Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-31-4'>So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-31-5'>He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-31-6'>You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-31-7'>yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-31-8'>If he said, `The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, `The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-31-9'>So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-31-10'>"In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-31-11'>The angel of God said to me in the dream, `Jacob.' I answered, `Here I am.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-31-12'>And he said, `Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-31-13'>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-31-14'>Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-31-15'>Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-31-16'>Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-31-17'>Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-31-18'>and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup> to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-31-19'>When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-31-20'>Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-31-21'>So he fled with all he had, and crossing the River, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup> he headed for the hill country of Gilead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-31-22'>On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-31-23'>Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-31-24'>Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-31-25'>Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-31-26'>Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-31-27'>Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-31-28'>You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by. You have done a foolish thing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-31-29'>I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, `Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-31-30'>Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-31-31'>Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-31-32'>But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-31-33'>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-31-34'>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-31-35'>Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-31-36'>Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-31-37'>Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-31-38'>"I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-31-39'>I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-31-40'>This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-31-41'>It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-31-42'>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-31-43'>Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-31-44'>Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-31-45'>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-31-46'>He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-31-47'>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup> and Jacob called it Galeed. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-31-48'>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-31-49'>It was also called Mizpah, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup> because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-31-50'>If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-31-51'>Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-31-52'>This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-31-53'>May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-31-54'>He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-31-55'>Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.

<h3>Genesis 32</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-32-1'>Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-32-2'>When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_1">1</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-32-3'>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-32-4'>He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my master Esau: `Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-32-5'>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-32-6'>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-32-7'>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_2">2</a>]</sup> and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-32-8'>He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_3">3</a>]</sup> the group 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_4">4</a>]</sup> that is left may escape."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-32-9'>Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, `Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-32-10'>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-32-11'>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-32-12'>But you have said, `I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-32-13'>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-32-14'>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-32-15'>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-32-16'>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-32-17'>He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, `To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-32-18'>then you are to say, `They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-32-19'>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-32-20'>And be sure to say, `Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-32-21'>So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-32-22'>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-32-23'>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-32-24'>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-32-25'>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-32-26'>Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-32-27'>The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-32-28'>Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_5">5</a>]</sup> because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-32-29'>Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-32-30'>So Jacob called the place Peniel, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_6">6</a>]</sup> saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-32-31'>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-32-32'>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-34-2'>When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and violated her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-34-3'>His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-34-4'>And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-34-5'>When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about it until they came home.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-34-6'>Then Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-34-7'>Now Jacob's sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-34-8'>But Hamor said to them, "My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-34-11'>Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-34-12'>Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-34-13'>Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-34-14'>They said to them, "We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-34-15'>We will give our consent to you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-34-16'>Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We'll settle among you and become one people with you.

<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-34-20'>So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-34-21'>"These men are friendly toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-34-22'>But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-34-23'>Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-34-24'>All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.

<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-34-25'>Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-34-26'>They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-34-27'>The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-34-28'>They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
</li></ol>

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-37-2'>This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-37-3'>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup> robe for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-37-4'>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-37-5'>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-37-6'>He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-37-7'>We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-37-8'>His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-37-9'>Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-37-10'>When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-37-11'>His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-37-12'>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-37-13'>and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-37-14'>So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-37-15'>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-37-16'>He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-37-17'>"They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, `Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-37-18'>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-37-19'>"Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-37-20'>"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-37-21'>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-37-22'>"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-37-23'>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-37-24'>and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-37-25'>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-37-26'>Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-37-27'>Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-37-28'>So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup> of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-37-29'>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-37-30'>He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-37-31'>Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-37-32'>They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-37-33'>He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-37-34'>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-37-35'>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_3">3</a>]</sup> to my son." So his father wept for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-37-36'>Meanwhile, the Midianites 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_4">4</a>]</sup> sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.

<h3>Genesis 38</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-38-1'>At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-38-2'>There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-38-3'>she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-38-4'>She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-38-5'>She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-38-6'>Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-38-7'>But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-38-8'>Then Judah said to Onan, "Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-38-9'>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-38-10'>What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-38-11'>Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He may die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-38-12'>After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-38-14'>she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-38-15'>When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-38-16'>Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you." "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-38-17'>"I'll send you a young goat from my flock," he said. "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?" she asked.

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-38-18'>He said, "What pledge should I give you?" "Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand," she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-38-23'>Then Judah said, "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her."

<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-38-24'>About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-38-25'>As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-38-26'>Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again.

<h3>Genesis 39</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-39-1'>Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-39-2'>The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.

<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-39-5'>From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-39-6'>So he left in Joseph's care everything he had; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-40-5'>each of the two men--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison--had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-40-6'>When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-40-7'>So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-40-8'>"We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-40-9'>So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-40-14'>But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.

<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-40-15'>For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-40-16'>When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-41-10'>Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-41-11'>Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-41-12'>Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-41-13'>And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_1">1</a>]</sup> "
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-41-14'>So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-41-15'>Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-41-16'>"I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-41-17'>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-41-18'>when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-41-19'>After them, seven other cows came up--scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-41-20'>The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-41-21'>But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-41-22'>"In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-41-23'>After them, seven other heads sprouted--withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-41-24'>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-41-25'>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-41-26'>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-41-27'>The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-41-28'>"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-41-29'>Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-41-30'>but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-41-31'>The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-41-32'>The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-41-33'>"And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-41-34'>Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-41-35'>They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-41-36'>This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-41-37'>The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-41-38'>So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_2">2</a>]</sup> ?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-41-39'>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-41-40'>You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-41-41'>So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-41-42'>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-41-43'>He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_3">3</a>]</sup> and men shouted before him, "Make way 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_4">4</a>]</sup> !" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-41-44'>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-41-45'>Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_5">5</a>]</sup> to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-41-46'>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-41-47'>During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-41-48'>Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-41-49'>Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-41-50'>Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-41-51'>Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_6">6</a>]</sup> and said, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-41-52'>The second son he named Ephraim 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_7">7</a>]</sup> and said, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-41-53'>The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-41-54'>and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-41-55'>When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-41-56'>When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='57'><li id='verse-41-57'>And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.

<h3>Genesis 42</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-42-1'>When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-42-2'>He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-42-3'>Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-42-4'>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-42-5'>So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-42-6'>Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-42-7'>As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-42-8'>Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-42-9'>Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-42-10'>"No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-42-11'>We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-42-12'>"No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-42-13'>But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-42-14'>Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-42-15'>And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-42-16'>Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-42-17'>And he put them all in custody for three days.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-42-18'>On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-42-19'>If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-42-20'>But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-42-21'>They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come upon us."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-42-22'>Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-42-23'>They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-42-24'>He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-42-25'>Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-42-26'>they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-42-27'>At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-42-28'>"My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-42-29'>When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-42-30'>"The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-42-31'>But we said to him, `We are honest men; we are not spies.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-42-32'>We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-42-33'>"Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, `This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-42-34'>But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-42-35'>As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-42-36'>Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-42-37'>Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back."

<h3>Genesis 43</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-43-1'>Now the famine was still severe in the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-43-2'>So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-43-3'>But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-43-4'>If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-43-5'>But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, `You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-43-6'>Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-43-7'>They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. `Is your father still living?' he asked us. `Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, `Bring your brother down here'?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-43-8'>Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-43-9'>I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-43-10'>As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-43-11'>Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-43-12'>Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-43-13'>Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-43-14'>And may God Almighty

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-43-15'>So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-43-16'>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at noon."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-43-17'>The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-43-18'>Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-43-19'>So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-43-20'>"Please, sir," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-43-21'>But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver--the exact weight--in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-43-22'>We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don't know who put our silver in our sacks."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-43-23'>"It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-43-24'>The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-43-25'>They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-43-26'>When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-43-27'>He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-43-28'>They replied, "Your servant our father is still alive and well." And they bowed low to pay him honor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-43-29'>As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-43-30'>Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-43-31'>After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-43-32'>They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-43-33'>The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-43-34'>When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.

<h3>Genesis 44</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-44-1'>Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house: "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-44-2'>Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one's sack, along with the silver for his grain." And he did as Joseph said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-44-3'>As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-44-4'>They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, `Why have you repaid good with evil?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-44-5'>Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-44-6'>When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-44-7'>But they said to him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-44-8'>We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-44-9'>If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-44-10'>"Very well, then," he said, "let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-44-11'>Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-44-12'>Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-44-13'>At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-44-14'>Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-44-15'>Joseph said to them, "What is this you have done? Don't you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-44-16'>"What can we say to my lord?" Judah replied. "What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. We are now my lord's slaves--we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-44-17'>But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-44-18'>Then Judah went up to him and said: "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-44-19'>My lord asked his servants, `Do you have a father or a brother?'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-44-20'>And we answered, `We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-44-21'>"Then you said to your servants, `Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-44-22'>And we said to my lord, `The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-44-23'>But you told your servants, `Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-44-24'>When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-44-25'>"Then our father said, `Go back and buy a little more food.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-44-26'>But we said, `We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-44-27'>"Your servant my father said to us, `You know that my wife bore me two sons.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-44-28'>One of them went away from me, and I said, "He has surely been torn to pieces." And I have not seen him since.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-44-29'>If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_297381782_1">1</a>]</sup> in misery.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-44-30'>"So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy's life,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-44-31'>sees that the boy isn't there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-44-32'>Your servant guaranteed the boy's safety to my father. I said, `If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-44-33'>"Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-44-34'>How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come upon my father."

<h3>Genesis 45</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-45-1'>Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-45-2'>And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-45-3'>Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-45-4'>Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-45-5'>And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-45-6'>For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-45-7'>But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_105861046_1">1</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-45-8'>"So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-45-9'>Now hurry back to my father and say to him, `This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-45-10'>You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me--you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-45-11'>I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-45-12'>"You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-45-13'>Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-45-14'>Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-45-15'>And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-45-16'>When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-45-17'>Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, `Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-45-18'>and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-45-19'>"You are also directed to tell them, `Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-45-20'>Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-45-21'>So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-45-22'>To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_105861046_2">2</a>]</sup> of silver and five sets of clothes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-45-23'>And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-45-24'>Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-45-25'>So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-45-26'>They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-45-27'>But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-45-28'>And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-46-2'>And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I am," he replied.

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-47-2'>He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.

<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-47-4'>They also said to him, "We have come to live here awhile, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants' flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen."

<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-47-5'>Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you,

<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-47-13'>There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
