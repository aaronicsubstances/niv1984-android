<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now these </span><i>are</i><span> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt </span><i>already</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel </span><i>are</i><span> more and mightier than we:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and </span><i>so</i><span> get them up out of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, </span><i>was</i><span> with rigour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see </span><i>them</i><span> upon the stools; if it </span><i>be</i><span> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it </span><i>be</i><span> a daughter, then she shall live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women </span><i>are</i><span> not as the Egyptian women; for they </span><i>are</i><span> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took </span><i>to wife</i><span> a daughter of Levi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he </span><i>was a</i><span> goodly </span><i>child</i><span>, she hid him three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid </span><i>it</i><span> in the flags by the river's brink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash </span><i>herself</i><span> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when she had opened </span><i>it</i><span>, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This </span><i>is one</i><span> of the Hebrews' children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give </span><i>thee</i><span> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that </span><i>there was</i><span> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew </span><i>water</i><span>, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How </span><i>is it that</i><span> ye are come so soon to day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew </span><i>water</i><span> enough for us, and watered the flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he said unto his daughters, And where </span><i>is</i><span> he? why </span><i>is</i><span> it </span><i>that</i><span> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And she bare </span><i>him</i><span> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush </span><i>was</i><span> not consumed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which </span><i>are</i><span> in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</span></div>
