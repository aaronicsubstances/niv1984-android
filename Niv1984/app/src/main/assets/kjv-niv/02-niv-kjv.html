<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt </span><i>already</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel </span><i>are</i><span> more and mightier than we:</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and </span><i>so</i><span> get them up out of the land.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, </span><i>was</i><span> with rigour.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see </span><i>them</i><span> upon the stools; if it </span><i>be</i><span> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it </span><i>be</i><span> a daughter, then she shall live.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women </span><i>are</i><span> not as the Egyptian women; for they </span><i>are</i><span> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-1" id="niv-verse-32-1">1</a>]</sup><span> who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for </span><i>as for</i><span> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which </span><i>are</i><span> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring </span><i>them</i><span> unto me.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-2" id="niv-verse-32-2">2</a>]</sup><span> O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he received </span><i>them</i><span> at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These </span><i>be</i><span> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, `These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These </span><i>be</i><span> thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Why should the Egyptians say, `It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: `I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony </span><i>were</i><span> in his hand: the tables </span><i>were</i><span> written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other </span><i>were</i><span> they written.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the tables </span><i>were</i><span> the work of God, and the writing </span><i>was</i><span> the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, </span><i>There is</i><span> a noise of war in the camp.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Moses replied: "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, </span><i>It is</i><span> not the voice of </span><i>them that</i><span> shout for mastery, neither </span><i>is it</i><span> the voice of </span><i>them that</i><span> cry for being overcome: </span><i>but</i><span> the noise of </span><i>them that</i><span> sing do I hear.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they </span><i>are set</i><span> on mischief.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They said to me, `Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for </span><i>as for</i><span> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break </span><i>it</i><span> off. So they gave </span><i>it</i><span> me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Moses saw that the people </span><i>were</i><span> naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto </span><i>their</i><span> shame among their enemies:)</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who </span><i>is</i><span> on the LORD'S side? </span><i>let him come</i><span> unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, </span><i>and</i><span> go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But now, please forgive their sin--but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore now go, lead the people unto </span><i>the place</i><span> of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, `I will give it to your descendants.'</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, </span><i>and</i><span> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, `You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'"</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye </span><i>are</i><span> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation </span><i>is</i><span> thy people.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."</span></div>
