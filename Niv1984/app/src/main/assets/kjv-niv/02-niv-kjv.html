<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, </span><i>was</i><span> with rigour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see </span><i>them</i><span> upon the stools; if it </span><i>be</i><span> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it </span><i>be</i><span> a daughter, then she shall live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women </span><i>are</i><span> not as the Egyptian women; for they </span><i>are</i><span> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-25'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[1] <span>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[2] <span>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[3] <span>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[4] <span>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[5] <span>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[6] <span>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[7] <span>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[8] <span>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[9] <span>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[10] <span>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I drew him out of the water."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[11] <span>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[12] <span>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[13] <span>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[14] <span>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[15] <span>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[16] <span>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[17] <span>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[18] <span>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[19] <span>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[20] <span>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[21] <span>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[22] <span>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[23] <span>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[24] <span>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[25] <span>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[7] <span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[10] <span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[11] <span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[12] <span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that </span><i>there was</i><span> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[13] <span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[4] <span>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here </span><i>am</i><span> I.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-76'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[1] <span>Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, `The LORD did not appear to you'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[2] <span>Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[3] <span>The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[5] <span>"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has appeared to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[6] <span>Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> like snow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[7] <span>"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[8] <span>Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[9] <span>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[10] <span>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[11] <span>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[12] <span>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[13] <span>But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[14] <span>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[15] <span>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[16] <span>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[17] <span>But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[18] <span>Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[19] <span>Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[20] <span>So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[21] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[22] <span>Then say to Pharaoh, `This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[23] <span>and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[24] <span>At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met [Moses] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and was about to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[25] <span>But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched [Moses'] feet with it. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[26] <span>So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[27] <span>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[28] <span>Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[29] <span>Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'>[28] <span>Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'>[29] <span>Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'>[30] <span>Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[7] <span>Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[8] <span>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'>[13] <span>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'>[16] <span>Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'>[30] <span>Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'>[31] <span>During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'>[33] <span>The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'>[34] <span>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'>[36] <span>The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'>[37] <span>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'>[39] <span>With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-335'>[28] <span>And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'>[30] <span>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for </span><i>there was</i><span> not a house where </span><i>there was</i><span> not one dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-350'>[43] <span>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This </span><i>is</i><span> the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'>[8] <span>The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'>[10] <span>As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'>[11] <span>They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'>[12] <span>Didn't we say to you in Egypt, `Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'>[13] <span>Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'>[14] <span>The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'>[15] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'>[21] <span>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'>[26] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'>[27] <span>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-412'>[28] <span>The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen--the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[1] <span>The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[2] <span>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[3] <span>The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[5] <span>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[6] <span>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[7] <span>and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[8] <span>Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-455'>[9] <span>Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, `Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'>[10] <span>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'>[11] <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[12] <span>"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, `At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[13] <span>That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[14] <span>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[15] <span>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[16] <span>This is what the LORD has commanded: `Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for each person you have in your tent.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[17] <span>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'>[18] <span>And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'>[19] <span>Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-466'>[20] <span>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[21] <span>Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[22] <span>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much--two omers</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for each person--and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-469'>[23] <span>He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded: `Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-470'>[24] <span>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[25] <span>"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'>[26] <span>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[27] <span>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-474'>[28] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-3" id="niv-verse-16-3">c</a>]</sup><span> refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[29] <span>Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-476'>[30] <span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-477'>[31] <span>The people of Israel called the bread manna.</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-4" id="niv-verse-16-4">d</a>]</sup><span> It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'>[32] <span>Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[33] <span>So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[34] <span>As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[35] <span>The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[5] <span>Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[7] <span>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[8] <span>Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'>[15] <span>Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'>[1] <span>In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt--on the very day--they came to the Desert of Sinai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'>[2] <span>After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[3] <span>Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[4] <span>`You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[8] <span>The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[9] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[18] <span>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[20] <span>The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[21] <span>and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-547'>[16] <span>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that </span><i>was</i><span> in the camp trembled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-554'>[23] <span>And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-555'>[24] <span>And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-984'>[15] <span>Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-986'>[17] <span>When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-989'>[20] <span>And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-990'>[21] <span>He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-991'>[22] <span>"Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-992'>[23] <span>They said to me, `Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-993'>[24] <span>So I told them, `Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-994'>[25] <span>Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-995'>[26] <span>So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997'>[28] <span>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-999'>[30] <span>The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1256'>[2] <span>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1257'>[3] <span>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1258'>[4] <span>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1259'>[5] <span>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1260'>[6] <span>And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1261'>[7] <span>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1262'>[8] <span>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1263'>[9] <span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that </span><i>is</i><span> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1264'>[10] <span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1265'>[11] <span>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1266'>[12] <span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1267'>[13] <span>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1268'>[14] <span>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1269'>[15] <span>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1270'>[16] <span>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1271'>[17] <span>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the month, </span><i>that</i><span> the tabernacle was reared up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1272'>[18] <span>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1273'>[19] <span>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1274'>[20] <span>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1275'>[21] <span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1276'>[22] <span>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1277'>[23] <span>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1278'>[24] <span>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1279'>[25] <span>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1280'>[26] <span>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1281'>[27] <span>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1282'>[28] <span>And he set up the hanging </span><i>at</i><span> the door of the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1283'>[29] <span>And he put the altar of burnt offering </span><i>by</i><span> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1284'>[30] <span>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash </span><i>withal</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1285'>[31] <span>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1286'>[32] <span>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1287'>[33] <span>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1288'>[34] <span>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1289'>[35] <span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1290'>[36] <span>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1291'>[37] <span>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1292'>[38] <span>For the cloud of the LORD </span><i>was</i><span> upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</span></div>
