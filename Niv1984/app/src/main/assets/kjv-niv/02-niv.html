<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-25'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[1] <span>Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[2] <span>and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[3] <span>But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[4] <span>His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[5] <span>Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[6] <span>She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[7] <span>Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[8] <span>"Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[9] <span>Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[10] <span>When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I drew him out of the water."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[11] <span>One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[12] <span>Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[13] <span>The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[14] <span>The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[15] <span>When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[16] <span>Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[17] <span>Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[18] <span>When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[19] <span>They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[20] <span>"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[21] <span>Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[22] <span>Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[23] <span>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[24] <span>God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[25] <span>So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-52'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[1] <span>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[2] <span>There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[3] <span>So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[4] <span>When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[5] <span>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[6] <span>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[7] <span>The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[8] <span>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey--the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[9] <span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[10] <span>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[11] <span>But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[12] <span>And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will worship God on this mountain."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[13] <span>Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, `The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, `What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[14] <span>God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> This is what you are to say to the Israelites: `I AM has sent me to you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[15] <span>God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, `The LORD, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[16] <span>"Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, `The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-- appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[17] <span>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--a land flowing with milk and honey.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[18] <span>"The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, `The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[19] <span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[20] <span>So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[21] <span>"And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[22] <span>Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-76'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[1] <span>Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, `The LORD did not appear to you'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[2] <span>Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[3] <span>The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[5] <span>"This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has appeared to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[6] <span>Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> like snow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[7] <span>"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[8] <span>Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[9] <span>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[10] <span>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[11] <span>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[12] <span>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[13] <span>But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[14] <span>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[15] <span>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[16] <span>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[17] <span>But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[18] <span>Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[19] <span>Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[20] <span>So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[21] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[22] <span>Then say to Pharaoh, `This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[23] <span>and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[24] <span>At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met [Moses] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and was about to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[25] <span>But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched [Moses'] feet with it. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[26] <span>So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[27] <span>The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[28] <span>Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[29] <span>Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'>[1] <span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[2] <span>Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[3] <span>Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'>[4] <span>But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'>[5] <span>Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'>[6] <span>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'>[12] <span>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'>[13] <span>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'>[14] <span>The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, "Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'>[16] <span>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, `Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[2] <span>that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[3] <span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: `How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[4] <span>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[5] <span>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[6] <span>They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians--something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[7] <span>Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[8] <span>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'>[13] <span>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'>[14] <span>they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[3] <span>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for his family, one for each household.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[4] <span>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316'>[9] <span>Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire--head, legs and inner parts.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'>[11] <span>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD's Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'>[12] <span>"On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320'>[13] <span>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'>[15] <span>For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'>[16] <span>On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat--that is all you may do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'>[17] <span>"Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'>[34] <span>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'>[35] <span>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'>[36] <span>The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'>[37] <span>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'>[38] <span>Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'>[39] <span>With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[2] <span>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[3] <span>The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[21] <span>Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[22] <span>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much--two omers</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for each person--and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-470'>[24] <span>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[25] <span>"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[27] <span>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[29] <span>Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'>[2] <span>After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'>[3] <span>and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for Moses said, "I have become an alien in a foreign land";</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'>[4] <span>and the other was named Eliezer, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for he said, "My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[5] <span>Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'>[6] <span>Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[7] <span>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[8] <span>Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'>[9] <span>Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'>[10] <span>He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'>[11] <span>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'>[12] <span>Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'>[13] <span>The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'>[15] <span>Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'>[16] <span>Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'>[17] <span>Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'>[18] <span>You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'>[19] <span>Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'>[20] <span>Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'>[21] <span>But select capable men from all the people--men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain--and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'>[22] <span>Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'>[23] <span>If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'>[24] <span>Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'>[25] <span>He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'>[1] <span>In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt--on the very day--they came to the Desert of Sinai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'>[2] <span>After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[3] <span>Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[4] <span>`You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'>[5] <span>Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'>[7] <span>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[8] <span>The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[9] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'>[10] <span>And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'>[11] <span>and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'>[12] <span>Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, `Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'>[14] <span>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[15] <span>Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[16] <span>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[18] <span>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> trembled violently,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[19] <span>and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[20] <span>The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[22] <span>Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'>[23] <span>Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, `Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'>[24] <span>The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997'>[28] <span>The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1230'>[21] <span>They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod--as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1231'>[22] <span>They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth--the work of a weaver--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1232'>[23] <span>with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-39-5" id="niv-verse-39-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1233'>[24] <span>They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1234'>[25] <span>And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1235'>[26] <span>The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1236'>[27] <span>For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen--the work of a weaver--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1237'>[28] <span>and the turban of fine linen, the linen headbands and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1238'>[29] <span>The sash was of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn--the work of an embroiderer--as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1239'>[30] <span>They made the plate, the sacred diadem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1240'>[31] <span>Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1241'>[32] <span>So all the work on the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1242'>[33] <span>Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1255'>[1] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1256'>[2] <span>"Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the first month.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1257'>[3] <span>Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1258'>[4] <span>Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1259'>[5] <span>Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1260'>[6] <span>"Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1261'>[7] <span>place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1262'>[8] <span>Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1263'>[9] <span>"Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1264'>[10] <span>Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1265'>[11] <span>Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1266'>[12] <span>"Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1269'>[15] <span>Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1270'>[16] <span>Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1271'>[17] <span>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1272'>[18] <span>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1273'>[19] <span>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1274'>[20] <span>He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1275'>[21] <span>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1276'>[22] <span>Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1277'>[23] <span>and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1278'>[24] <span>He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1279'>[25] <span>and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1280'>[26] <span>Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1281'>[27] <span>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1282'>[28] <span>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1283'>[29] <span>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1284'>[30] <span>He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1285'>[31] <span>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1286'>[32] <span>They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1287'>[33] <span>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1288'>[34] <span>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1289'>[35] <span>Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1290'>[36] <span>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1291'>[37] <span>but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out--until the day it lifted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1292'>[38] <span>So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels. </span></div>
