<div id='verse-725'>[1] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-726'>[2] <span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-727'>[3] <span>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</span></div>

<div id='verse-730'>[6] <span>And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</span></div>

<div id='verse-731'>[7] <span>And for thy cattle, and for the beast that </span><i>are</i><span> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-732'>[8] <span>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-733'>[9] <span>Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth </span><i>day</i><span> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-735'>[11] <span>A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather </span><i>the grapes</i><span> in it of thy vine undressed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-736'>[12] <span>For it </span><i>is</i><span> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</span></div>

<div id='verse-755'>[31] <span>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</span></div>
