<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-218'>[31] <span>Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> `Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'</span></div>
