<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-775'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So the property of the Levites is redeemable--that is, a house sold in any town they hold--and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.</span></div>
