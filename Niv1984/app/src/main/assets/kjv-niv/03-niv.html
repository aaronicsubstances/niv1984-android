<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-751'>[3] <span>Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'>[4] <span>The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-753'>[5] <span>"Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for each loaf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-754'>[6] <span>Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-755'>[7] <span>Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the LORD by fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-756'>[8] <span>This bread is to be set out before the LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-761'>[13] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-762'>[14] <span>"Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-763'>[15] <span>Say to the Israelites: `If anyone curses his God, he will be held responsible;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-764'>[16] <span>anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-767'>[19] <span>If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-768'>[20] <span>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other, so he is to be injured.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-785'>[12] <span>For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-786'>[13] <span>"`In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to his own property.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787'>[14] <span>"`If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him, do not take advantage of each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-788'>[15] <span>You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And he is to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-789'>[16] <span>When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what he is really selling you is the number of crops.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-790'>[17] <span>Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'>[28] <span>But if he does not acquire the means to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and he can then go back to his property.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'>[29] <span>"`If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time he may redeem it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'>[30] <span>If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'>[31] <span>But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'>[33] <span>So the property of the Levites is redeemable--that is, a house sold in any town they hold--and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'>[34] <span>But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'>[42] <span>Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.</span></div>
