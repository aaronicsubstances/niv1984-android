<div id='verse-422'>[2] <span>And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</span></div>

<div id='verse-423'>[3] <span>And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[4] <span>And the mixt multitude that </span><i>was</i><span> among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span></div>

<div id='verse-425'>[5] <span>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:</span></div>

<div id='verse-427'>[7] <span>And the manna </span><i>was</i><span> as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[8] <i>And</i><span> the people went about, and gathered </span><i>it</i><span>, and ground </span><i>it</i><span> in mills, or beat </span><i>it</i><span> in a mortar, and baked </span><i>it</i><span> in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[9] <span>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[10] <span>Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[11] <span>And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[12] <span>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[17] <span>And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which </span><i>is</i><span> upon thee, and will put </span><i>it</i><span> upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear </span><i>it</i><span> not thyself alone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[18] <span>And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for </span><i>it was</i><span> well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-439'>[19] <span>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</span></div>

<div id='verse-440'>[20] <i>But</i><span> even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which </span><i>is</i><span> among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[21] <span>And Moses said, The people, among whom I </span><i>am</i><span>, </span><i>are</i><span> six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span></div>

<div id='verse-442'>[22] <span>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span></div>

<div id='verse-444'>[24] <span>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-445'>[25] <span>And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that </span><i>was</i><span> upon him, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span>, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</span></div>

<div id='verse-446'>[26] <span>But there remained two </span><i>of the</i><span> men in the camp, the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they </span><i>were</i><span> of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[27] <span>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[28] <span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, </span><i>one</i><span> of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[29] <span>And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, </span><i>and</i><span> that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</span></div>

<div id='verse-450'>[30] <span>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-451'>[31] <span>And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let </span><i>them</i><span> fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits </span><i>high</i><span> upon the face of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-452'>[32] <span>And the people stood up all that day, and all </span><i>that</i><span> night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread </span><i>them</i><span> all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-453'>[33] <span>And while the flesh </span><i>was</i><span> yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</span></div>

<div id='verse-523'>[19] <span>Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</span></div>

<div id='verse-524'>[20] <span>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</span></div>

<div id='verse-525'>[21] <span>But </span><i>as</i><span> truly </span><i>as</i><span> I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-526'>[22] <span>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</span></div>

<div id='verse-532'>[28] <span>Say unto them, </span><i>As truly as</i><span> I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</span></div>

<div id='verse-533'>[29] <span>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-539'>[35] <span>I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</span></div>

<div id='verse-540'>[36] <span>And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</span></div>

<div id='verse-541'>[37] <span>Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-543'>[39] <span>And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-544'>[40] <span>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we </span><i>be here</i><span>, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-545'>[41] <span>And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</span></div>

<div id='verse-546'>[42] <span>Go not up, for the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-547'>[43] <span>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites </span><i>are</i><span> there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-548'>[44] <span>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-549'>[45] <span>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Hormah.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<div id='verse-591'>[1] <span>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took </span><i>men</i><span>:</span></div>

<div id='verse-592'>[2] <span>And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</span></div>

<div id='verse-593'>[3] <span>And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, </span><i>Ye take</i><span> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation </span><i>are</i><span> holy, every one of them, and the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?</span></div>

<div id='verse-594'>[4] <span>And when Moses heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he fell upon his face:</span></div>

<div id='verse-595'>[5] <span>And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who </span><i>are</i><span> his, and </span><i>who is</i><span> holy; and will cause </span><i>him</i><span> to come near unto him: even </span><i>him</i><span> whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[6] <span>This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</span></div>

<div id='verse-599'>[9] <i>Seemeth it but</i><span> a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?</span></div>

<div id='verse-600'>[10] <span>And he hath brought thee near </span><i>to him</i><span>, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?</span></div>

<div id='verse-601'>[11] <span>For which cause </span><i>both</i><span> thou and all thy company </span><i>are</i><span> gathered together against the LORD: and what </span><i>is</i><span> Aaron, that ye murmur against him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-602'>[12] <span>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:</span></div>

<div id='verse-603'>[13] <i>Is it</i><span> a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?</span></div>

<div id='verse-604'>[14] <span>Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-607'>[17] <span>And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each </span><i>of you</i><span> his censer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-608'>[18] <span>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-613'>[23] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-614'>[24] <span>Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span></div>

<div id='verse-615'>[25] <span>And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-616'>[26] <span>And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-617'>[27] <span>So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-621'>[31] <span>And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that </span><i>was</i><span> under them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-622'>[32] <span>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that </span><i>appertained</i><span> unto Korah, and all </span><i>their</i><span> goods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-623'>[33] <span>They, and all that </span><i>appertained</i><span> to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-624'>[34] <span>And all Israel that </span><i>were</i><span> round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up </span><i>also</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-625'>[35] <span>And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span></div>

<div id='verse-626'>[36] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-628'>[38] <span>The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates </span><i>for</i><span> a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-629'>[39] <span>And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad </span><i>plates for</i><span> a covering of the altar:</span></div>

<div id='verse-631'>[41] <span>But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-632'>[42] <span>And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span></div>

<div id='verse-633'>[43] <span>And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-634'>[44] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-635'>[45] <span>Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</span></div>

<div id='verse-636'>[46] <span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-637'>[47] <span>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-638'>[48] <span>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-639'>[49] <span>Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-781'>[10] <span>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, </span><i>saying</i><span>,</span></div>

<div id='verse-784'>[13] <span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-785'>[14] <span>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-786'>[15] <span>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</span></div>

<div id='verse-787'>[16] <span>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-788'>[17] <span>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-789'>[18] <span>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-790'>[19] <span>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-791'>[20] <span>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, </span><i>and</i><span> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-792'>[21] <span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-793'>[22] <span>And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants </span><i>were</i><span> with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-794'>[23] <span>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-795'>[24] <span>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall </span><i>being</i><span> on this side, and a wall on that side.</span></div>

<div id='verse-796'>[25] <span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-797'>[26] <span>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where </span><i>was</i><span> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-798'>[27] <span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</span></div>

<div id='verse-799'>[28] <span>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</span></div>

<div id='verse-800'>[29] <span>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-801'>[30] <span>And the ass said unto Balaam, </span><i>Am</i><span> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since </span><i>I was</i><span> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</span></div>

<div id='verse-802'>[31] <span>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</span></div>

<div id='verse-803'>[32] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because </span><i>thy</i><span> way is perverse before me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-804'>[33] <span>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</span></div>

<div id='verse-805'>[34] <span>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-806'>[35] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-807'>[36] <span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which </span><i>is</i><span> in the border of Arnon, which </span><i>is</i><span> in the utmost coast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-808'>[37] <span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</span></div>

<div id='verse-809'>[38] <span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-810'>[39] <span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1115'>[1] <span>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place </span><i>was</i><span> a place for cattle;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1116'>[2] <span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1127'>[13] <span>And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1128'>[14] <span>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1129'>[15] <span>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1130'>[16] <span>And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</span></div>
