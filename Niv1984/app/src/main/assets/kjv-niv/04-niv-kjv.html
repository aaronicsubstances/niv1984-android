<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-205'>[8] <span>But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'>[3] <span>Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'>[4] <span>This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold--from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the LORD had shown Moses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'>[4] <span>So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'>[6] <span>But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-386'>[8] <span>And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[17] <span>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[18] <span>"Tell the people: `Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[19] <span>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[20] <span>but for a whole month--until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it--because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[21] <span>But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, `I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[22] <span>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[27] <span>A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'>[1] <span>That night all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'>[2] <span>All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this desert!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[3] <span>Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[4] <span>And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'>[5] <span>Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'>[6] <span>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'>[7] <span>and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[8] <span>If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[9] <span>Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow them up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'>[10] <span>But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'>[11] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'>[12] <span>I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'>[13] <span>Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'>[14] <span>And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[15] <span>If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[16] <span>`The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[18] <span>`The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[19] <span>In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[20] <span>The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[21] <span>Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[22] <span>not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'>[23] <span>not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'>[24] <span>But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'>[25] <span>Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'>[26] <span>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'>[27] <span>"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'>[28] <span>So tell them, `As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'>[29] <span>In this desert your bodies will fall--every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'>[30] <span>Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'>[31] <span>As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'>[32] <span>But you--your bodies will fall in this desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'>[33] <span>Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'>[34] <span>For forty years--one year for each of the forty days you explored the land--you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'>[35] <span>I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'>[36] <span>So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'>[37] <span>these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'>[38] <span>Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'>[39] <span>When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'>[40] <span>Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. "We have sinned," they said. "We will go up to the place the LORD promised."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'>[41] <span>But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD's command? This will not succeed!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'>[42] <span>Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'>[43] <span>for the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'>[44] <span>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD's covenant moved from the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'>[45] <span>Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'>[1] <span>Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites--Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth--became insolent</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[2] <span>and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[3] <span>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[4] <span>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[5] <span>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'>[6] <span>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'>[7] <span>and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[8] <span>Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[9] <span>Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'>[10] <span>He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[11] <span>It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[12] <span>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[13] <span>Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'>[14] <span>Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[15] <span>Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[16] <span>Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow--you and they and Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'>[17] <span>Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it--250 censers in all--and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'>[18] <span>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'>[19] <span>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'>[20] <span>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-642'>[21] <span>"Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'>[22] <span>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'>[23] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'>[24] <span>"Say to the assembly, `Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'>[25] <span>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'>[26] <span>He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'>[27] <span>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'>[28] <span>Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'>[29] <span>If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'>[30] <span>But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave,</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-3" id="niv-verse-16-3">c</a>]</sup><span> then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'>[31] <span>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'>[32] <span>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'>[33] <span>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'>[34] <span>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'>[35] <span>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'>[36] <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'>[37] <span>"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'>[38] <span>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-660'>[39] <span>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-661'>[40] <span>as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-662'>[41] <span>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-663'>[42] <span>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-623'>[2] <span>And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-625'>[4] <span>And when Moses heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he fell upon his face:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-630'>[9] <i>Seemeth it but</i><span> a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-639'>[18] <span>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-643'>[22] <span>And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-644'>[23] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-646'>[25] <span>And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-648'>[27] <span>So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-649'>[28] <span>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for </span><i>I have</i><span> not </span><i>done them</i><span> of mine own mind.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-654'>[33] <span>They, and all that </span><i>appertained</i><span> to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-655'>[34] <span>And all Israel that </span><i>were</i><span> round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up </span><i>also</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-656'>[35] <span>And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-660'>[39] <span>And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad </span><i>plates for</i><span> a covering of the altar:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-662'>[41] <span>But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-667'>[46] <span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-668'>[47] <span>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'>[2] <span>"This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'>[3] <span>Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'>[6] <span>The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-729'>[7] <span>After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'>[18] <span>Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'>[19] <span>The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and that evening he will be clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-742'>[20] <span>But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself, he must be cut off from the community, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, and he is unclean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-743'>[21] <span>This is a lasting ordinance for them. "The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-777'>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778'>[1] <span>When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-779'>[2] <span>Then Israel made this vow to the LORD: "If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> their cities."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-780'>[3] <span>The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-781'>[4] <span>They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-3" id="niv-verse-21-3">c</a>]</sup><span> to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-782'>[5] <span>they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-783'>[6] <span>Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-784'>[7] <span>The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us." So Moses prayed for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-785'>[8] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-786'>[9] <span>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787'>[10] <span>The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-788'>[11] <span>Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-789'>[12] <span>From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-790'>[13] <span>They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-791'>[14] <span>That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: "... Waheb in Suphah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-4" id="niv-verse-21-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and the ravines, the Arnon</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-792'>[15] <span>and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-5" id="niv-verse-21-5">e</a>]</sup><span> the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-793'>[16] <span>From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I will give them water."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-794'>[17] <span>Then Israel sang this song: "Spring up, O well! Sing about it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-795'>[18] <span>about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank-- the nobles with scepters and staffs." Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-796'>[19] <span>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797'>[20] <span>and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-798'>[21] <span>Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799'>[22] <span>"Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway until we have passed through your territory." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800'>[23] <span>But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'>[24] <span>Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'>[25] <span>Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'>[26] <span>Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'>[27] <span>That is why the poets say: "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's city be restored. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805'>[28] <span>"Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'>[29] <span>Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'>[30] <span>"But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'>[31] <span>So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'>[32] <span>After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810'>[33] <span>Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-811'>[34] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812'>[35] <span>So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-818'>[4] <span>The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'>[6] <span>Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1178'>[1] <span>The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1181'>[4] <span>the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel--are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1182'>[5] <span>If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1187'>[10] <span>The LORD's anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1190'>[13] <span>The LORD's anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1199'>[22] <span>then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1201'>[24] <span>Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1202'>[25] <span>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1203'>[26] <span>Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1204'>[27] <span>But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1205'>[28] <span>Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1206'>[29] <span>He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1348'>[2] <span>They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1349'>[3] <span>Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1350'>[4] <span>When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1352'>[6] <span>This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1353'>[7] <span>No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1354'>[8] <span>Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.</span></div>
