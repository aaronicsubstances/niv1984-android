<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'>[12] <span>Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'>[13] <span>They set out, this first time, at the LORD's command through Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'>[14] <span>The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'>[15] <span>Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'>[17] <span>Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'>[18] <span>The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'>[21] <span>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'>[22] <span>The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'>[23] <span>Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'>[25] <span>Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-429'>[26] <span>Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'>[28] <span>This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'>[29] <span>Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, `I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'>[30] <span>He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'>[31] <span>But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'>[33] <span>So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442'>[1] <span>Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'>[2] <span>When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[3] <span>So that place was called Taberah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> because fire from the LORD had burned among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[4] <span>The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[7] <span>The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[8] <span>The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[9] <span>When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[10] <span>Moses heard the people of every family wailing, each at the entrance to his tent. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[11] <span>He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[12] <span>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[13] <span>Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, `Give us meat to eat!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-455'>[14] <span>I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'>[15] <span>If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now--if I have found favor in your eyes--and do not let me face my own ruin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'>[16] <span>The LORD said to Moses: "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[17] <span>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[18] <span>"Tell the people: `Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[19] <span>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[20] <span>but for a whole month--until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it--because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[21] <span>But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, `I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[22] <span>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'>[23] <span>The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'>[24] <span>So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-466'>[25] <span>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[26] <span>However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the Tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[27] <span>A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-469'>[28] <span>Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-470'>[29] <span>But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[30] <span>Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'>[31] <span>Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[32] <span>All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-474'>[33] <span>But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[34] <span>Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-6" id="niv-verse-11-6">f</a>]</sup><span> because there they buried the people who had craved other food.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[1] <span>Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[2] <span>"Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[3] <span>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'>[4] <span>At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'>[5] <span>Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'>[6] <span>he said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'>[9] <span>The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-488'>[10] <span>When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam--leprous, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'>[11] <span>and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[12] <span>Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'>[13] <span>So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'>[14] <span>The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back."</span></div>

They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[15] <span>If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[16] <span>`The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>"Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[18] <span>`The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[19] <span>In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[20] <span>The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[21] <span>Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[22] <span>not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'>[26] <span>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'>[27] <span>"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'>[28] <span>So tell them, `As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'>[29] <span>In this desert your bodies will fall--every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'>[30] <span>Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'>[31] <span>As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'>[32] <span>But you--your bodies will fall in this desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'>[33] <span>Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'>[34] <span>For forty years--one year for each of the forty days you explored the land--you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'>[35] <span>I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'>[36] <span>So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'>[37] <span>these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'>[38] <span>Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'>[39] <span>When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'>[40] <span>Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. "We have sinned," they said. "We will go up to the place the LORD promised."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'>[41] <span>But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD's command? This will not succeed!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'>[42] <span>Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'>[43] <span>for the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'>[44] <span>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD's covenant moved from the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'>[45] <span>Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[2] <span>and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[3] <span>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[4] <span>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[5] <span>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[8] <span>Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[9] <span>Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[11] <span>It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[12] <span>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[13] <span>Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[15] <span>Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[16] <span>Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow--you and they and Aaron.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'>[18] <span>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'>[19] <span>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'>[22] <span>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'>[23] <span>Then the LORD said to Moses,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'>[25] <span>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'>[26] <span>He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'>[27] <span>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'>[28] <span>Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'>[29] <span>If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'>[31] <span>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'>[32] <span>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'>[33] <span>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'>[34] <span>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'>[35] <span>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'>[36] <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'>[37] <span>"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'>[38] <span>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-660'>[39] <span>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-661'>[40] <span>as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-662'>[41] <span>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD's people," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-663'>[42] <span>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-664'>[43] <span>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-665'>[44] <span>and the LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-666'>[45] <span>"Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-667'>[46] <span>Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-668'>[47] <span>So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-669'>[48] <span>He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-670'>[49] <span>But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-674'>[1] <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675'>[2] <span>"Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676'>[3] <span>On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-677'>[4] <span>Place them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678'>[5] <span>The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-679'>[6] <span>So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron's staff was among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680'>[7] <span>Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-681'>[8] <span>The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the house of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-682'>[9] <span>Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own staff.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-683'>[10] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "Put back Aaron's staff in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-684'>[11] <span>Moses did just as the LORD commanded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-685'>[12] <span>The Israelites said to Moses, "We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-689'>[1] <span>The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons and your father's family are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the priesthood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-690'>[2] <span>Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the Tent of the Testimony.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-691'>[3] <span>They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the Tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-692'>[4] <span>They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the Tent of Meeting--all the work at the Tent--and no one else may come near where you are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'>[5] <span>"You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'>[6] <span>I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to do the work at the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'>[8] <span>Then the LORD said to Aaron, "I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion and regular share.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'>[9] <span>You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-705'>[17] <span>"But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-706'>[18] <span>Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'>[24] <span>Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the LORD. That is why I said concerning them: `They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-713'>[25] <span>The LORD said to Moses,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-714'>[26] <span>"Speak to the Levites and say to them: `When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the LORD's offering.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-716'>[28] <span>In this way you also will present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the LORD's portion to Aaron the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-717'>[29] <span>You must present as the LORD's portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'>[30] <span>"Say to the Levites: `When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'>[31] <span>You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'>[2] <span>"This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded: Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'>[3] <span>Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'>[6] <span>The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-732'>[10] <span>The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the aliens living among them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-780'>[3] <span>The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-781'>[4] <span>They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-3" id="niv-verse-21-3">c</a>]</sup><span> to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-818'>[4] <span>The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'>[6] <span>Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'>[7] <span>The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'>[8] <span>"Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me." So the Moabite princes stayed with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-824'>[10] <span>Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'>[12] <span>But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'>[13] <span>The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, "Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'>[25] <span>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[26] <span>Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'>[27] <span>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'>[28] <span>Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'>[29] <span>Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'>[30] <span>The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'>[31] <span>Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'>[32] <span>The angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-3" id="niv-verse-22-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'>[33] <span>The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'>[34] <span>Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'>[35] <span>The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'>[36] <span>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1347'>[1] <span>The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1348'>[2] <span>They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1349'>[3] <span>Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1350'>[4] <span>When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1351'>[5] <span>Then at the LORD's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1352'>[6] <span>This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1353'>[7] <span>No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1354'>[8] <span>Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1355'>[9] <span>No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1356'>[10] <span>So Zelophehad's daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1357'>[11] <span>Zelophehad's daughters--Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah--married their cousins on their father's side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1358'>[12] <span>They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's clan and tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1359'>[13] <span>These are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-36-1" id="niv-verse-36-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
