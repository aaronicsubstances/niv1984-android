<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>These </span><i>be</i><span> the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red </span><i>sea</i><span>, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>(</span><i>There are</i><span> eleven days' </span><i>journey</i><span> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the month, </span><i>that</i><span> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all </span><i>the places</i><span> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye </span><i>are</i><span> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye </span><i>are</i><span>, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken </span><i>is</i><span> good </span><i>for us</i><span> to do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear </span><i>the causes</i><span> between your brethren, and judge righteously between </span><i>every</i><span> man and his brother, and the stranger </span><i>that is</i><span> with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; </span><i>but</i><span> ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment </span><i>is</i><span> God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring </span><i>it</i><span> unto me, and I will hear it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up </span><i>and</i><span> possess </span><i>it</i><span>, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought </span><i>it</i><span> down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, </span><i>It is</i><span> a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[26] <span>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[27] <span>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[28] <span>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people </span><i>is</i><span> greater and taller than we; the cities </span><i>are</i><span> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[29] <span>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[30] <span>The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[31] <span>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[32] <span>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[33] <span>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents </span><i>in</i><span>, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[34] <span>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[35] <span>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[36] <span>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[37] <span>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[38] <i>But</i><span> Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[39] <span>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[40] <span>But </span><i>as for</i><span> you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[41] <span>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[42] <span>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I </span><i>am</i><span> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[43] <span>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[44] <span>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Hormah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[45] <span>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[46] <span>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode </span><i>there</i><span>.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-47'>[1] <span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[2] <span>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[3] <span>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[4] <span>And command thou the people, saying, Ye </span><i>are</i><span> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[5] <span>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau </span><i>for</i><span> a possession.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[6] <span>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[7] <span>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God </span><i>hath been</i><span> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[8] <span>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[9] <span>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land </span><i>for</i><span> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot </span><i>for</i><span> a possession.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[10] <span>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[11] <span>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[12] <span>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[13] <span>Now rise up, </span><i>said I</i><span>, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[14] <span>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, </span><i>was</i><span> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[15] <span>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[16] <span>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[17] <span>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[18] <span>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[19] <span>And </span><i>when</i><span> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon </span><i>any</i><span> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot </span><i>for</i><span> a possession.</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[20] <span>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[21] <span>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[22] <span>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[23] <span>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[24] <span>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess </span><i>it</i><span>, and contend with him in battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[25] <span>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations </span><i>that are</i><span> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[26] <span>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[27] <span>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[28] <span>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[29] <span>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[30] <span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as </span><i>appeareth</i><span> this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[31] <span>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[32] <span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[33] <span>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[34] <span>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[35] <span>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[36] <span>From Aroer, which </span><i>is</i><span> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and </span><i>from</i><span> the city that </span><i>is</i><span> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[37] <span>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, </span><i>nor</i><span> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-84'>[1] <span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[2] <span>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[3] <span>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[4] <span>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[5] <span>All these cities </span><i>were</i><span> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[6] <span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[7] <span>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[8] <span>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that </span><i>was</i><span> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[9] <span>(</span><i>Which</i><span> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[10] <span>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[11] <span>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead </span><i>was</i><span> a bedstead of iron; </span><i>is</i><span> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits </span><i>was</i><span> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[12] <span>And this land, </span><i>which</i><span> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which </span><i>is</i><span> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[13] <span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, </span><i>being</i><span> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[14] <span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[15] <span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[16] <span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, </span><i>which is</i><span> the border of the children of Ammon;</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[17] <span>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast </span><i>thereof</i><span>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, </span><i>even</i><span> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[18] <span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all </span><i>that are</i><span> meet for the war.</span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[19] <span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (</span><i>for</i><span> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[21] <span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[23] <span>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[25] <span>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that </span><i>is</i><span> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[26] <span>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[27] <span>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold </span><i>it</i><span> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-248'>[3] <span>And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every </span><i>word</i><span> that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</span></div>

<div id='verse-249'>[4] <span>Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-254'>[9] <span>A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any </span><i>thing</i><span> in it; a land whose stones </span><i>are</i><span> iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[10] <span>When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-266'>[1] <span>Hear, O Israel: Thou </span><i>art</i><span> to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</span></div>

<div id='verse-267'>[2] <span>A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and </span><i>of whom</i><span> thou hast heard </span><i>say</i><span>, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</span></div>

<div id='verse-268'>[3] <span>Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God </span><i>is</i><span> he which goeth over before thee; </span><i>as</i><span> a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-269'>[4] <span>Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-270'>[5] <span>Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[6] <span>Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou </span><i>art</i><span> a stiffnecked people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-272'>[7] <span>Remember, </span><i>and</i><span> forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[8] <span>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-274'>[9] <span>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, </span><i>even</i><span> the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</span></div>

<div id='verse-275'>[10] <span>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them </span><i>was written</i><span> according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[11] <span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, </span><i>that</i><span> the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, </span><i>even</i><span> the tables of the covenant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-277'>[12] <span>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted </span><i>themselves</i><span>; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span></div>

<div id='verse-278'>[13] <span>Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it </span><i>is</i><span> a stiffnecked people:</span></div>

<div id='verse-279'>[14] <span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</span></div>

<div id='verse-280'>[15] <span>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant </span><i>were</i><span> in my two hands.</span></div>

<div id='verse-281'>[16] <span>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, </span><i>and</i><span> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[17] <span>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[18] <span>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[19] <span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[20] <span>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[21] <span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, </span><i>and</i><span> ground </span><i>it</i><span> very small, </span><i>even</i><span> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[22] <span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[23] <span>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[24] <span>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[25] <span>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down </span><i>at the first</i><span>; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[26] <span>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[27] <span>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[28] <span>Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[29] <span>Yet they </span><i>are</i><span> thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</span></div>

<div id='verse-789'>[2] <span>And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;</span></div>

<div id='verse-792'>[5] <span>And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.</span></div>

<div id='verse-793'>[6] <span>Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I </span><i>am</i><span> the LORD your God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-794'>[7] <span>And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-795'>[8] <span>And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-796'>[9] <span>Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-855'>[19] <span>Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-856'>[20] <span>For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-857'>[21] <span>And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</span></div>

<div id='verse-858'>[22] <span>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-859'>[23] <span>And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-860'>[24] <span>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</span></div>

<div id='verse-861'>[25] <span>That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-862'>[26] <span>Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-863'>[27] <span>For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?</span></div>

<div id='verse-864'>[28] <span>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-865'>[29] <span>For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt </span><i>yourselves</i><span>, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</span></div>

<div id='verse-866'>[30] <span>And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</span></div>

<div id='verse-870'>[4] <i>He is</i><span> the Rock, his work </span><i>is</i><span> perfect: for all his ways </span><i>are</i><span> judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right </span><i>is</i><span> he.</span></div>

<div id='verse-871'>[5] <span>They have corrupted themselves, their spot </span><i>is</i><span> not </span><i>the spot</i><span> of his children: </span><i>they are</i><span> a perverse and crooked generation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-872'>[6] <span>Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? </span><i>is</i><span> not he thy father </span><i>that</i><span> hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-874'>[8] <span>When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-877'>[11] <span>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</span></div>

<div id='verse-878'>[12] <i>So</i><span> the LORD alone did lead him, and </span><i>there was</i><span> no strange god with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-879'>[13] <span>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</span></div>

<div id='verse-880'>[14] <span>Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</span></div>

<div id='verse-882'>[16] <span>They provoked him to jealousy with strange </span><i>gods</i><span>, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-887'>[21] <span>They have moved me to jealousy with </span><i>that which is</i><span> not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with </span><i>those which are</i><span> not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-909'>[43] <span>Rejoice, O ye nations, </span><i>with</i><span> his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, </span><i>and</i><span> to his people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-910'>[44] <span>And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-914'>[48] <span>And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-915'>[49] <span>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, </span><i>unto</i><span> mount Nebo, which </span><i>is</i><span> in the land of Moab, that </span><i>is</i><span> over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</span></div>

<div id='verse-916'>[50] <span>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</span></div>
