<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust </span><i>it</i><span> through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.</span></div>
