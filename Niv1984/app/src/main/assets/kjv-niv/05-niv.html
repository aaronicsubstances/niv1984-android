<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan--that is, in the Arabah--opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying: </span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers--to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and to their descendants after them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>You answered me, "What you propose to do is good."</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you--as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to."</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[26] <span>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[27] <span>You grumbled in your tents and said, "The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[28] <span>Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, `The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[29] <span>Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[30] <span>The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[31] <span>and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[32] <span>In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[33] <span>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[34] <span>When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[35] <span>"Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[36] <span>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly."</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[37] <span>Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[38] <span>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[39] <span>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad--they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[40] <span>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[41] <span>Then you replied, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[42] <span>But the LORD said to me, "Tell them, `Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[43] <span>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[44] <span>The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[45] <span>You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[46] <span>And so you stayed in Kadesh many days--all the time you spent there.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-2'>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-47'>[1] <span>Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[2] <span>Then the LORD said to me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[3] <span>"You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[4] <span>Give the people these orders: `You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[5] <span>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[6] <span>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[7] <span>The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[8] <span>So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[9] <span>Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession."</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[10] <span>(The Emites used to live there--a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[11] <span>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[12] <span>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[13] <span>And the LORD said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[14] <span>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[15] <span>The LORD's hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[16] <span>Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[17] <span>the LORD said to me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[18] <span>"Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[19] <span>When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot."</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[20] <span>(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[21] <span>They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[22] <span>The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[23] <span>And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> destroyed them and settled in their place.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[24] <span>"Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[25] <span>This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[26] <span>From the desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[27] <span>"Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[28] <span>Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot--</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[29] <span>as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us--until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[30] <span>But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[31] <span>The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land."</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[32] <span>When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[33] <span>the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[34] <span>At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> them--men, women and children. We left no survivors.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[35] <span>But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[36] <span>From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[37] <span>But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-84'>[1] <span>Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[2] <span>The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[3] <span>So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[4] <span>At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them--the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[5] <span>All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[6] <span>We completely destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> every city--men, women and children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[7] <span>But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[8] <span>So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[9] <span>(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[10] <span>We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[11] <span>(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-4" id="niv-verse-3-4">d</a>]</sup><span> It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[12] <span>Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.</span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[13] <span>The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[14] <span>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-5" id="niv-verse-3-5">e</a>]</sup><span> )</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[15] <span>And I gave Gilead to Makir.</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[16] <span>But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[17] <span>Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-6" id="niv-verse-3-6">f</a>]</sup><span> ), below the slopes of Pisgah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[18] <span>I commanded you at that time: "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[19] <span>However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[20] <span>until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[21] <span>At that time I commanded Joshua: "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[22] <span>Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[23] <span>At that time I pleaded with the LORD:</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[24] <span>"O Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[25] <span>Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan--that fine hill country and Lebanon."</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[26] <span>But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," the LORD said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[27] <span>Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-111'>[28] <span>But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."</span></div>

<div id='verse-112'>[29] <span>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-113'>[1] <span>Hear now, O Israel, the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-123'>[11] <span>You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-124'>[12] <span>Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-125'>[13] <span>He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-126'>[14] <span>And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</span></div>

<div id='verse-127'>[15] <span>You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[16] <span>so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[17] <span>or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,</span></div>

<div id='verse-130'>[18] <span>or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.</span></div>

<div id='verse-131'>[19] <span>And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars--all the heavenly array--do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[20] <span>But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.</span></div>

<div id='verse-133'>[21] <span>The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-134'>[22] <span>I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[23] <span>Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[24] <span>For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[25] <span>After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time--if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and provoking him to anger,</span></div>

<div id='verse-138'>[26] <span>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-139'>[27] <span>The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[28] <span>There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[29] <span>But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.</span></div>

<div id='verse-142'>[30] <span>When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and obey him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-143'>[31] <span>For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your forefathers, which he confirmed to them by oath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[32] <span>Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created man on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[33] <span>Has any other people heard the voice of God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[34] <span>Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by miraculous signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[35] <span>You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[36] <span>From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[37] <span>Because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[38] <span>to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[39] <span>Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[40] <span>Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time.</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[41] <span>Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[42] <span>to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if he had unintentionally killed his neighbor without malice aforethought. He could flee into one of these cities and save his life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[43] <span>The cities were these: Bezer in the desert plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[44] <span>This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[45] <span>These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[47] <span>They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-162'>[1] <span>Moses summoned all Israel and said: Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[2] <span>The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[3] <span>It was not with our fathers that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[4] <span>The LORD spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[5] <span>(At that time I stood between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said: </span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[6] <span>"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[7] <span>"You shall have no other gods before </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[8] <span>"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[9] <span>You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[10] <span>but showing love to a thousand [generations] of those who love me and keep my commandments.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[11] <span>"You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[12] <span>"Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[13] <span>Six days you shall labor and do all your work,</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[14] <span>but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[15] <span>Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[16] <span>"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[17] <span>"You shall not murder.</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[21] <span>"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." </span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[22] <span>These are the commandments the LORD proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[23] <span>When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leading men of your tribes and your elders came to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[24] <span>And you said, "The LORD our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-186'>[25] <span>But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-187'>[26] <span>For what mortal man has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived?</span></div>

<div id='verse-188'>[27] <span>Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us whatever the LORD our God tells you. We will listen and obey."</span></div>

<div id='verse-189'>[28] <span>The LORD heard you when you spoke to me and the LORD said to me, "I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good.</span></div>

<div id='verse-190'>[29] <span>Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[30] <span>"Go, tell them to return to their tents.</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[31] <span>But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess."</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[17] <span>You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-264'>[19] <span>If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-266'>[1] <span>Hear, O Israel. You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky.</span></div>

<div id='verse-267'>[2] <span>The people are strong and tall--Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: "Who can stand up against the Anakites?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-268'>[3] <span>But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the LORD has promised you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-269'>[4] <span>After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness." No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-270'>[5] <span>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[6] <span>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-272'>[7] <span>Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[8] <span>At Horeb you aroused the LORD's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-274'>[9] <span>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-275'>[10] <span>The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[11] <span>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-277'>[12] <span>Then the LORD told me, "Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves."</span></div>

<div id='verse-278'>[13] <span>And the LORD said to me, "I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!</span></div>

<div id='verse-279'>[14] <span>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they."</span></div>

<div id='verse-280'>[15] <span>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-281'>[16] <span>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[17] <span>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[18] <span>Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and so provoking him to anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[19] <span>I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[20] <span>And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[21] <span>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[22] <span>You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[23] <span>And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and take possession of the land I have given you." But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[24] <span>You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[25] <span>I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[26] <span>I prayed to the LORD and said, "O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[27] <span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[28] <span>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, `Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the desert.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[29] <span>But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-295'>[1] <span>At that time the LORD said to me, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-296'>[2] <span>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the chest."</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[3] <span>So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[4] <span>The LORD wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[5] <span>Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me, and they are there now.</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[6] <span>(The Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[7] <span>From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[8] <span>At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today.</span></div>

<div id='verse-303'>[9] <span>That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as the LORD your God told them.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-304'>[10] <span>Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, as I did the first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-305'>[11] <span>"Go," the LORD said to me, "and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-306'>[12] <span>And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</span></div>

<div id='verse-307'>[13] <span>and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?</span></div>

<div id='verse-308'>[14] <span>To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-309'>[15] <span>Yet the LORD set his affection on your forefathers and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today.</span></div>

<div id='verse-310'>[16] <span>Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-311'>[17] <span>For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-312'>[18] <span>He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-313'>[19] <span>And you are to love those who are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-314'>[20] <span>Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-315'>[21] <span>He is your praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-318'>[2] <span>Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the LORD your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;</span></div>

<div id='verse-319'>[3] <span>the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;</span></div>

<div id='verse-320'>[4] <span>what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> as they were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-321'>[5] <span>It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the desert until you arrived at this place,</span></div>

<div id='verse-325'>[9] <span>and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your forefathers to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span></div>

<div id='verse-326'>[10] <span>The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden.</span></div>

<div id='verse-328'>[12] <span>It is a land the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-329'>[13] <span>So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today--to love the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul--</span></div>

<div id='verse-330'>[14] <span>then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and oil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[1] <span>At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[2] <span>This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow Israelite. He shall not require payment from his fellow Israelite or brother, because the LORD's time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[3] <span>You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your brother owes you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[4] <span>However, there should be no poor among you, for in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[5] <span>if only you fully obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.</span></div>

<div id='verse-434'>[7] <span>If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-435'>[8] <span>Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.</span></div>

<div id='verse-436'>[9] <span>Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near," so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[10] <span>Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[11] <span>There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[14] <span>Supply him liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-444'>[17] <span>then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-445'>[18] <span>Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-446'>[19] <span>Set apart for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.</span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[20] <span>Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose.</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[21] <span>If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[22] <span>You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-837'>[1] <span>Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel:</span></div>

<div id='verse-838'>[2] <span>"I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has said to me, `You shall not cross the Jordan.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-839'>[3] <span>The LORD your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the LORD said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-840'>[4] <span>And the LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-841'>[5] <span>The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-842'>[6] <span>Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-843'>[7] <span>Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their forefathers to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-844'>[8] <span>The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</span></div>

<div id='verse-845'>[9] <span>So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-846'>[10] <span>Then Moses commanded them: "At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Feast of Tabernacles,</span></div>

<div id='verse-847'>[11] <span>when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-848'>[12] <span>Assemble the people--men, women and children, and the aliens living in your towns--so they can listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-849'>[13] <span>Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."</span></div>

<div id='verse-850'>[14] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>

<div id='verse-851'>[15] <span>Then the LORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-852'>[16] <span>And the LORD said to Moses: "You are going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-853'>[17] <span>On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, `Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?'</span></div>

<div id='verse-854'>[18] <span>And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-855'>[19] <span>"Now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-856'>[20] <span>When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their forefathers, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-857'>[21] <span>And when many disasters and difficulties come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath."</span></div>

<div id='verse-858'>[22] <span>So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-859'>[23] <span>The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-860'>[24] <span>After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,</span></div>

<div id='verse-861'>[25] <span>he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:</span></div>

<div id='verse-862'>[26] <span>"Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-863'>[27] <span>For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!</span></div>

<div id='verse-864'>[28] <span>Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-865'>[29] <span>For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made."</span></div>

<div id='verse-866'>[30] <span>And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel: </span></div>

<div id='verse-875'>[9] <span>For the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. </span></div>

<div id='verse-876'>[10] <span>In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,</span></div>

<div id='verse-877'>[11] <span>like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.</span></div>

<div id='verse-878'>[12] <span>The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him. </span></div>

<div id='verse-879'>[13] <span>He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag,</span></div>

<div id='verse-880'>[14] <span>with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape. </span></div>

<div id='verse-881'>[15] <span>Jeshurun </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-4" id="niv-verse-32-4">d</a>]</sup><span> grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior.</span></div>

<div id='verse-882'>[16] <span>They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.</span></div>

<div id='verse-883'>[17] <span>They sacrificed to demons, which are not God-- gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-884'>[18] <span>You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. </span></div>

<div id='verse-885'>[19] <span>The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-886'>[20] <span>"I will hide my face from them," he said, "and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-887'>[21] <span>They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.</span></div>

<div id='verse-890'>[24] <span>I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-891'>[25] <span>In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-896'>[30] <span>How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?</span></div>

<div id='verse-902'>[36] <span>The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.</span></div>

<div id='verse-903'>[37] <span>He will say: "Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,</span></div>

<div id='verse-911'>[45] <span>When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,</span></div>

Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-33-5" id="niv-verse-33-5">e</a>]</sup><span> his brothers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-935'>[17] <span>In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh."</span></div>

<div id='verse-936'>[18] <span>About Zebulun he said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-948'>[1] <span>Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land--from Gilead to Dan,</span></div>

<div id='verse-949'>[2] <span>all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-1" id="niv-verse-34-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-950'>[3] <span>the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-951'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, `I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it."</span></div>

<div id='verse-952'>[5] <span>And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-953'>[6] <span>He buried him </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-2" id="niv-verse-34-2">b</a>]</sup><span> in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.</span></div>

<div id='verse-954'>[7] <span>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-955'>[8] <span>The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.</span></div>

<div id='verse-956'>[9] <span>Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-3" id="niv-verse-34-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-957'>[10] <span>Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</span></div>

<div id='verse-958'>[11] <span>who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-959'>[12] <span>For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel. </span></div>
