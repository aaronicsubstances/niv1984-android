<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan--that is, in the Arabah--opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers--to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and to their descendants after them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>You answered me, "What you propose to do is good."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you--as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>You grumbled in your tents and said, "The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, `The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>"Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad--they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>Then you replied, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>But the LORD said to me, "Tell them, `Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>And so you stayed in Kadesh many days--all the time you spent there.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-2'>
<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-49'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[1] <span>Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[2] <span>Then the LORD said to me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[3] <span>"You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[4] <span>Give the people these orders: `You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[5] <span>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[6] <span>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[7] <span>The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[8] <span>So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[9] <span>Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[10] <span>(The Emites used to live there--a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[11] <span>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[12] <span>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[13] <span>And the LORD said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[14] <span>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[15] <span>The LORD's hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[16] <span>Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[17] <span>the LORD said to me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[18] <span>"Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[19] <span>When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[20] <span>(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[21] <span>They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[22] <span>The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[23] <span>And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> destroyed them and settled in their place.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[24] <span>"Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[25] <span>This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[26] <span>From the desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[27] <span>"Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[28] <span>Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[29] <span>as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us--until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[30] <span>But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[31] <span>The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[32] <span>When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[33] <span>the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[34] <span>At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> them--men, women and children. We left no survivors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[35] <span>But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[36] <span>From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[37] <span>But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-88'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[1] <span>Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[2] <span>The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[3] <span>So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[4] <span>At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them--the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[5] <span>All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[6] <span>We completely destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> every city--men, women and children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[7] <span>But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[8] <span>So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[9] <span>(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[10] <span>We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[11] <span>(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-4" id="niv-verse-3-4">d</a>]</sup><span> It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[12] <span>Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[13] <span>The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[14] <span>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-5" id="niv-verse-3-5">e</a>]</sup><span> )</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[15] <span>And I gave Gilead to Makir.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[16] <span>But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[17] <span>Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-6" id="niv-verse-3-6">f</a>]</sup><span> ), below the slopes of Pisgah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[18] <span>I commanded you at that time: "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[19] <span>However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'>[20] <span>until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'>[21] <span>At that time I commanded Joshua: "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'>[22] <span>Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[23] <span>At that time I pleaded with the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[24] <span>"O Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'>[25] <span>Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan--that fine hill country and Lebanon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'>[26] <span>But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," the LORD said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'>[27] <span>Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'>[28] <span>But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'>[5] <span>See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[10] <span>Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[11] <span>You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[12] <span>Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[13] <span>He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[14] <span>And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[15] <span>You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[16] <span>so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[19] <span>And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars--all the heavenly array--do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[20] <span>But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[21] <span>The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[22] <span>I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[23] <span>Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[25] <span>After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time--if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and provoking him to anger,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[26] <span>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[27] <span>The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[35] <span>You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[36] <span>From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[37] <span>Because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[38] <span>to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'>[2] <span>The people are strong and tall--Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: "Who can stand up against the Anakites?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'>[3] <span>But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'>[4] <span>After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'>[5] <span>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'>[6] <span>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'>[7] <span>Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'>[8] <span>At Horeb you aroused the LORD's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'>[9] <span>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'>[10] <span>The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293'>[11] <span>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294'>[12] <span>Then the LORD told me, "Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'>[13] <span>And the LORD said to me, "I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-296'>[14] <span>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-297'>[15] <span>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298'>[16] <span>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'>[18] <span>Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and so provoking him to anger.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[20] <span>And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[21] <span>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[22] <span>You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[23] <span>And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and take possession of the land I have given you." But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[24] <span>You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[25] <span>I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[26] <span>I prayed to the LORD and said, "O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[27] <span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[28] <span>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, `Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the desert.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'>[64] <span>Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods--gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[66] <span>You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-911'>[14] <span>The LORD said to Moses, "Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912'>[15] <span>Then the LORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-913'>[16] <span>And the LORD said to Moses: "You are going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-914'>[17] <span>On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-915'>[18] <span>And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-916'>[19] <span>"Now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-918'>[21] <span>And when many disasters and difficulties come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919'>[22] <span>So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'>[23] <span>The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun: "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-921'>[24] <span>After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-922'>[25] <span>he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-925'>[28] <span>Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-926'>[29] <span>For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you.
