<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-10-2'><b>(NIV)</b> He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-10-6'><b>(NIV)</b> The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-10-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</i>
