<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, </span><i>even</i><span> to the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, </span><i>so</i><span> I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it </span><i>to</i><span> the right hand or </span><i>to</i><span> the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God </span><i>is</i><span> with thee whithersoever thou goest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as </span><i>he hath given</i><span> you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Whosoever </span><i>he be</i><span> that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they </span><i>were</i><span>:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>And it came to pass </span><i>about the time</i><span> of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that </span><i>were</i><span> on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>And as soon as we had heard </span><i>these things</i><span>, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he </span><i>is</i><span> God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house </span><i>was</i><span> upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>And the men said unto her, We </span><i>will be</i><span> blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>Behold, </span><i>when</i><span> we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>And it shall be, </span><i>that</i><span> whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood </span><i>shall be</i><span> upon his head, and we </span><i>will be</i><span> guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood </span><i>shall be</i><span> on our head, if </span><i>any</i><span> hand be upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>And she said, According unto your words, so </span><i>be</i><span> it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought </span><i>them</i><span> throughout all the way, but found </span><i>them</i><span> not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all </span><i>things</i><span> that befell them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[24] <span>And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-232'>Chapter 10</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-233'>[1] <span>Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-234'>[2] <span>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon </span><i>was</i><span> a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it </span><i>was</i><span> greater than Ai, and all the men thereof </span><i>were</i><span> mighty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-235'>[3] <span>Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-236'>[4] <span>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-237'>[5] <span>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-238'>[6] <span>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-239'>[7] <span>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-240'>[8] <span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-241'>[9] <span>Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, </span><i>and</i><span> went up from Gilgal all night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-242'>[10] <span>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-243'>[11] <span>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, </span><i>and</i><span> were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: </span><i>they were</i><span> more which died with hailstones than </span><i>they</i><span> whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-244'>[12] <span>Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-245'>[13] <span>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. </span><i>Is</i><span> not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-246'>[14] <span>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-247'>[15] <span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-248'>[16] <span>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-249'>[17] <span>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-250'>[18] <span>And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-251'>[19] <span>And stay ye not, </span><i>but</i><span> pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-252'>[20] <span>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest </span><i>which</i><span> remained of them entered into fenced cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-253'>[21] <span>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-254'>[22] <span>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-255'>[23] <span>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, </span><i>and</i><span> the king of Eglon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-256'>[24] <span>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-257'>[25] <span>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-258'>[26] <span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-259'>[27] <span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, </span><i>that</i><span> Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, </span><i>which remain</i><span> until this very day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-260'>[28] <span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-263'>[31] <span>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-264'>[32] <span>And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-265'>[33] <span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-266'>[34] <span>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-267'>[35] <span>And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-268'>[36] <span>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-269'>[37] <span>And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-270'>[38] <span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-272'>[40] <span>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-279'>[2] <span>And to the kings that </span><i>were</i><span> on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</span></div>
