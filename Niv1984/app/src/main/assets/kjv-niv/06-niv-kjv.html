<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, </span><i>even</i><span> to the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, </span><i>so</i><span> I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it </span><i>to</i><span> the right hand or </span><i>to</i><span> the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as </span><i>he hath given</i><span> you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho."

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they </span><i>were</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass </span><i>about the time</i><span> of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And as soon as we had heard </span><i>these things</i><span>, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he </span><i>is</i><span> God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house </span><i>was</i><span> upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, </span><i>when</i><span> we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it shall be, </span><i>that</i><span> whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood </span><i>shall be</i><span> upon his head, and we </span><i>will be</i><span> guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood </span><i>shall be</i><span> on our head, if </span><i>any</i><span> hand be upon him.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said, According unto your words, so </span><i>be</i><span> it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought </span><i>them</i><span> throughout all the way, but found </span><i>them</i><span> not.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all </span><i>things</i><span> that befell them:</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After three days the officers went throughout the camp,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>giving orders to the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, `We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us?</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We </span><i>are</i><span> very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore ye </span><i>are</i><span> cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you.

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you."</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now, behold, we </span><i>are</i><span> in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">1</a>]</sup><span> it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon </span><i>was</i><span> a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it </span><i>was</i><span> greater than Ai, and all the men thereof </span><i>were</i><span> mighty.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the five kings of the Amorites--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon--joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, </span><i>and</i><span> went up from Gilgal all night.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, </span><i>and</i><span> were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: </span><i>they were</i><span> more which died with hailstones than </span><i>they</i><span> whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">2</a>]</sup><span> its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. </span><i>Is</i><span> not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely--almost to a man--but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest </span><i>which</i><span> remained of them entered into fenced cities.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So they brought the five kings out of the cave--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, </span><i>that</i><span> Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, </span><i>which remain</i><span> until this very day.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that </span><i>were</i><span> therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span></div>
