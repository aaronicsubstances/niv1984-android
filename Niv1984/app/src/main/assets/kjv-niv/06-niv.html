<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>"Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates--all the Hittite country--to the Great Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> on the west.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>"Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>So Joshua ordered the officers of the people:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>"Go through the camp and tell the people, `Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>"Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: `The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-21'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> named Rahab and stayed there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>"Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>"Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[24] <span>They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-47'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[1] <span>Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[2] <span>After three days the officers went throughout the camp,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[3] <span>giving orders to the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[4] <span>Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> between you and the ark; do not go near it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[5] <span>Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[6] <span>Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[7] <span>And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[8] <span>Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: `When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the river.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[9] <span>Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[10] <span>This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[11] <span>See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[12] <span>Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[13] <span>And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD--the Lord of all the earth--set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[14] <span>So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[15] <span>Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[16] <span>the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[17] <span>The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-66'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[1] <span>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[2] <span>"Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[3] <span>and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[4] <span>So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[5] <span>and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[6] <span>to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, `What do these stones mean?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[7] <span>tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[8] <span>So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[9] <span>Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[10] <span>Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[11] <span>and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[12] <span>The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[13] <span>About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[14] <span>That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[15] <span>Then the LORD said to Joshua,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[16] <span>"Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[17] <span>So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[18] <span>And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[19] <span>On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[20] <span>And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[21] <span>He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, `What do these stones mean?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[22] <span>tell them, `Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[23] <span>For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over.

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-92'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[1] <span>Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[2] <span>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[3] <span>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[4] <span>Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt--all the men of military age--died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[5] <span>All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[6] <span>The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[7] <span>So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[8] <span>And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[9] <span>Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[10] <span>On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[11] <span>The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[13] <span>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[14] <span>"Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[15] <span>The commander of the LORD's army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'>[13] <span>The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'>[14] <span>So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'>[15] <span>On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'>[16] <span>The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[18] <span>But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'>[19] <span>All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[20] <span>When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[21] <span>They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it--men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[22] <span>Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[23] <span>So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[24] <span>Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[25] <span>But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho--and she lives among the Israelites to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[26] <span>At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: "Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: "At the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[27] <span>So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[1] <span>But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD's anger burned against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[2] <span>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy out the region." So the men went up and spied out Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[3] <span>When they returned to Joshua, they said, "Not all the people will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people, for only a few men are there."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[4] <span>So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[5] <span>who killed about thirty-six of them.

At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[6] <span>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[7] <span>And Joshua said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[11] <span>Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[12] <span>That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[16] <span>Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[17] <span>The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[18] <span>Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[19] <span>Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> the God of Israel, and give him the praise. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-5" id="niv-verse-7-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[20] <span>Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[21] <span>When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-6" id="niv-verse-7-6">f</a>]</sup><span> two hundred shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-7" id="niv-verse-7-7">g</a>]</sup><span> of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-8" id="niv-verse-7-8">h</a>]</sup><span> I coveted them and took them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[22] <span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[23] <span>They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[24] <span>Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[25] <span>Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[1] <span>Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[2] <span>You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[3] <span>So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[4] <span>with these orders: "Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[5] <span>I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'>[6] <span>They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, `They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'>[7] <span>you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174'>[8] <span>When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'>[9] <span>Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai--but Joshua spent that night with the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'>[10] <span>Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'>[11] <span>The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'>[12] <span>Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'>[13] <span>They had the soldiers take up their positions--all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'>[14] <span>When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'>[15] <span>Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'>[16] <span>All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'>[17] <span>Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'>[18] <span>Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'>[19] <span>As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'>[20] <span>The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'>[21] <span>For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'>[22] <span>The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'>[23] <span>But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'>[24] <span>When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'>[25] <span>Twelve thousand men and women fell that day--all the people of Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[26] <span>For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> all who lived in Ai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[27] <span>But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[28] <span>So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'>[29] <span>He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-196'>[30] <span>Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-197'>[31] <span>as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'>[34] <span>Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law--the blessings and the curses--just as it is written in the Book of the Law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-212'>[9] <span>They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-213'>[10] <span>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan--Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-214'>[11] <span>And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, `Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; make a treaty with us."'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'>[20] <span>This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-224'>[21] <span>They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'>[22] <span>Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, `We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us?</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-232'>Chapter 10</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'>[1] <span>Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'>[2] <span>He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'>[3] <span>So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'>[4] <span>"Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'>[5] <span>Then the five kings of the Amorites--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon--joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'>[6] <span>The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'>[7] <span>So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'>[8] <span>The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'>[9] <span>After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[10] <span>The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[11] <span>As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[12] <span>On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[13] <span>So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup><span> its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[14] <span>There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[15] <span>Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[16] <span>Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[17] <span>When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[18] <span>he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[19] <span>But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[20] <span>So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely--almost to a man--but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[21] <span>The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'>[22] <span>Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'>[23] <span>So they brought the five kings out of the cave--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[24] <span>When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[25] <span>Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[26] <span>Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[27] <span>At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[28] <span>That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[29] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[30] <span>The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[31] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[32] <span>The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[33] <span>Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army--until no survivors were left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[34] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[35] <span>They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[36] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[37] <span>They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[38] <span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[39] <span>They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[40] <span>So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'>[41] <span>Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[42] <span>All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-363'>Chapter 14</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'>[1] <span>Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'>[2] <span>Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'>[3] <span>Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'>[4] <span>for the sons of Joseph had become two tribes--Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'>[5] <span>So the Israelites divided the land, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'>[6] <span>Now the men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'>[7] <span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'>[8] <span>but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. I, however, followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'>[9] <span>So on that day Moses swore to me, `The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'>[10] <span>"Now then, just as the LORD promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the desert. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'>[11] <span>I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'>[12] <span>Now give me this hill country that the LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-376'>[13] <span>Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'>[1] <span>The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[2] <span>but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[3] <span>So Joshua said to the Israelites: "How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[4] <span>Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'>[5] <span>You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph in its territory on the north.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'>[6] <span>After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'>[7] <span>The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-485'>[8] <span>As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, "Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-486'>[9] <span>So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'>[10] <span>Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-488'>[11] <span>The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'>[12] <span>On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the desert of Beth Aven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[13] <span>From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'>[14] <span>From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'>[15] <span>The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-493'>[16] <span>The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-494'>[17] <span>It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-495'>[18] <span>It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and on down into the Arabah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-496'>[19] <span>It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-497'>[20] <span>The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-498'>[21] <span>The tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, had the following cities: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'>[1] <span>Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'>[2] <span>and said to them, "You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'>[3] <span>For a long time now--to this very day--you have not deserted your brothers but have carried out the mission the LORD your God gave you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'>[4] <span>Now that the LORD your God has given your brothers rest as he promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[5] <span>But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to obey his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[6] <span>Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[7] <span>(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan with their brothers.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[8] <span>saying, "Return to your homes with your great wealth--with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing--and divide with your brothers the plunder from your enemies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'>[9] <span>So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'>[10] <span>When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[11] <span>And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[12] <span>the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'>[13] <span>So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead--to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[14] <span>With him they sent ten of the chief men, one for each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[15] <span>When they went to Gilead--to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh--they said to them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[16] <span>"The whole assembly of the LORD says: `How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the LORD and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'>[17] <span>Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the LORD!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[18] <span>And are you now turning away from the LORD? "`If you rebel against the LORD today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[19] <span>If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the LORD's land, where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building an altar for yourselves, other than the altar of the LORD our God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'>[20] <span>When Achan son of Zerah acted unfaithfully regarding the devoted things, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">a</a>]</sup><span> did not wrath come upon the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'>[21] <span>Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'>[22] <span>"The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows! And let Israel know! If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the LORD, do not spare us this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'>[23] <span>If we have built our own altar to turn away from the LORD and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-2" id="niv-verse-22-2">b</a>]</sup><span> on it, may the LORD himself call us to account.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-642'>[24] <span>"No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, `What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'>[25] <span>The LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you--you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the LORD.' So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'>[26] <span>"That is why we said, `Let us get ready and build an altar--but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'>[27] <span>On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the LORD at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, `You have no share in the LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'>[28] <span>"And we said, `If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the LORD's altar, which our fathers built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'>[29] <span>"Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'>[30] <span>When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community--the heads of the clans of the Israelites--heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'>[31] <span>And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is with us, because you have not acted unfaithfully toward the LORD in this matter. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the LORD's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'>[32] <span>Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'>[33] <span>They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'>[34] <span>And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name: A Witness Between Us that the LORD is God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-673'>[1] <span>Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-674'>[2] <span>Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Long ago your forefathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the River </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and worshiped other gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675'>[3] <span>But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the River and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676'>[4] <span>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678'>[6] <span>When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-2" id="niv-verse-24-2">b</a>]</sup><span> as far as the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-3" id="niv-verse-24-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-679'>[7] <span>But they cried to the LORD for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680'>[8] <span>"`I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land.</span></div>
