<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered </span><i>their meat</i><span> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before </span><i>was</i><span> Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before </span><i>was</i><span> Kirjathsepher:</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>And it came to pass, when she came </span><i>to him</i><span>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off </span><i>her</i><span> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which </span><i>lieth</i><span> in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out </span><i>the inhabitants of</i><span> the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD </span><i>was</i><span> with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before </span><i>was</i><span> Luz.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[26] <span>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which </span><i>is</i><span> the name thereof unto this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[27] <span>Neither did Manasseh drive out </span><i>the inhabitants of</i><span> Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[28] <span>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[29] <span>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[30] <span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[31] <span>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[32] <span>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[33] <span>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[34] <span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[35] <span>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[36] <span>And the coast of the Amorites </span><i>was</i><span> from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-37'>[1] <span>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[2] <span>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[3] <span>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be </span><i>as thorns</i><span> in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[4] <span>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[5] <span>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[6] <span>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[7] <span>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[8] <span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, </span><i>being</i><span> an hundred and ten years old.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[9] <span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[10] <span>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[11] <span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[12] <span>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that </span><i>were</i><span> round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[13] <span>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[14] <span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[15] <span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[16] <span>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[17] <span>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; </span><i>but</i><span> they did not so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[18] <span>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[19] <span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, </span><i>that</i><span> they returned, and corrupted </span><i>themselves</i><span> more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[20] <span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[21] <span>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[22] <span>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep </span><i>it</i><span>, or not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[23] <span>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-60'>[1] <span>Now these </span><i>are</i><span> the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, </span><i>even</i><span> as many </span><i>of Israel</i><span> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[2] <span>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[3] <i>Namely</i><span>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[4] <span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[5] <span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[6] <span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[7] <span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[8] <span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[9] <span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, </span><i>even</i><span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[10] <span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[11] <span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[12] <span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[13] <span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[14] <span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[15] <span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[16] <span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[17] <span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon </span><i>was</i><span> a very fat man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[18] <span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[19] <span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that </span><i>were</i><span> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[20] <span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of </span><i>his</i><span> seat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[21] <span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[22] <span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[23] <span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[24] <span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour </span><i>were</i><span> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[25] <span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened </span><i>them</i><span>: and, behold, their lord </span><i>was</i><span> fallen down dead on the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[26] <span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[27] <span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[28] <span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[29] <span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[30] <span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[31] <span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-4'>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-91'>[1] <span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[2] <span>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host </span><i>was</i><span> Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[3] <span>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[4] <span>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[5] <span>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[6] <span>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[7] <span>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[8] <span>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, </span><i>then</i><span> I will not go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[9] <span>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[10] <span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[11] <span>Now Heber the Kenite, </span><i>which was</i><span> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which </span><i>is</i><span> by Kedesh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[12] <span>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[13] <span>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, </span><i>even</i><span> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[14] <span>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this </span><i>is</i><span> the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[15] <span>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all </span><i>his</i><span> chariots, and all </span><i>his</i><span> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off </span><i>his</i><span> chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[16] <span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; </span><i>and</i><span> there was not a man left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[17] <span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for </span><i>there was</i><span> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[18] <span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[19] <span>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[20] <span>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</span></div>

<div id='verse-111'>[21] <span>Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-112'>[22] <span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her </span><i>tent</i><span>, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail </span><i>was</i><span> in his temples.</span></div>

<div id='verse-113'>[23] <span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-114'>[24] <span>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-146'>[1] <span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[2] <span>And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: </span><i>and</i><span> because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which </span><i>are</i><span> in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[3] <span>And </span><i>so</i><span> it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[4] <span>And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[5] <span>For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; </span><i>for</i><span> both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[6] <span>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[7] <span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[8] <span>That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[9] <span>And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[10] <span>And I said unto you, I </span><i>am</i><span> the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[11] <span>And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which </span><i>was</i><span> in Ophrah, that </span><i>pertained</i><span> unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide </span><i>it</i><span> from the Midianites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[12] <span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD </span><i>is</i><span> with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[13] <span>And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where </span><i>be</i><span> all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[14] <span>And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[15] <span>And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family </span><i>is</i><span> poor in Manasseh, and I </span><i>am</i><span> the least in my father's house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[16] <span>And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[17] <span>And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[18] <span>Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set </span><i>it</i><span> before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[19] <span>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought </span><i>it</i><span> out unto him under the oak, and presented </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[20] <span>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay </span><i>them</i><span> upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[21] <span>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that </span><i>was</i><span> in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[22] <span>And when Gideon perceived that he </span><i>was</i><span> an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[23] <span>And the LORD said unto him, Peace </span><i>be</i><span> unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[24] <span>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it </span><i>is</i><span> yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[25] <span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that </span><i>is</i><span> by it:</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[26] <span>And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[27] <span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and </span><i>so</i><span> it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do </span><i>it</i><span> by day, that he did </span><i>it</i><span> by night.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[28] <span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that </span><i>was</i><span> by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar </span><i>that was</i><span> built.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[29] <span>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[30] <span>Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that </span><i>was</i><span> by it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[31] <span>And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst </span><i>it is yet</i><span> morning: if he </span><i>be</i><span> a god, let him plead for himself, because </span><i>one</i><span> hath cast down his altar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[32] <span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[33] <span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-179'>[34] <span>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-180'>[35] <span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-181'>[36] <span>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[37] <span>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; </span><i>and</i><span> if the dew be on the fleece only, and </span><i>it be</i><span> dry upon all the earth </span><i>beside</i><span>, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[38] <span>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[39] <span>And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[40] <span>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-186'>[1] <span>Then Jerubbaal, who </span><i>is</i><span> Gideon, and all the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</span></div>

<div id='verse-187'>[2] <span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that </span><i>are</i><span> with thee </span><i>are</i><span> too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-188'>[3] <span>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever </span><i>is</i><span> fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-189'>[4] <span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people </span><i>are</i><span> yet </span><i>too</i><span> many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, </span><i>that</i><span> of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-190'>[5] <span>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[6] <span>And the number of them that lapped, </span><i>putting</i><span> their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[7] <span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the </span><i>other</i><span> people go every man unto his place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-193'>[8] <span>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all </span><i>the rest of</i><span> Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span></div>

<div id='verse-194'>[9] <span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[10] <span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[11] <span>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that </span><i>were</i><span> in the host.</span></div>

<div id='verse-197'>[12] <span>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels </span><i>were</i><span> without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</span></div>

<div id='verse-198'>[13] <span>And when Gideon was come, behold, </span><i>there was</i><span> a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</span></div>

<div id='verse-199'>[14] <span>And his fellow answered and said, This </span><i>is</i><span> nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: </span><i>for</i><span> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</span></div>

<div id='verse-200'>[15] <span>And it was </span><i>so</i><span>, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</span></div>

<div id='verse-201'>[16] <span>And he divided the three hundred men </span><i>into</i><span> three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-202'>[17] <span>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be </span><i>that</i><span>, as I do, so shall ye do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-203'>[18] <span>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that </span><i>are</i><span> with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, </span><i>The sword</i><span> of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[19] <span>So Gideon, and the hundred men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that </span><i>were</i><span> in their hands.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[20] <span>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow </span><i>withal</i><span>: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-206'>[21] <span>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-207'>[22] <span>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, </span><i>and</i><span> to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[23] <span>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-209'>[24] <span>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-210'>[25] <span>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-246'>[1] <span>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-247'>[2] <span>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether </span><i>is</i><span> better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, </span><i>which are</i><span> threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I </span><i>am</i><span> your bone and your flesh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-248'>[3] <span>And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He </span><i>is</i><span> our brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-249'>[4] <span>And they gave him threescore and ten </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-250'>[5] <span>And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, </span><i>being</i><span> threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-251'>[6] <span>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that </span><i>was</i><span> in Shechem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-252'>[7] <span>And when they told </span><i>it</i><span> to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-253'>[8] <span>The trees went forth </span><i>on a time</i><span> to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-254'>[9] <span>But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[10] <span>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, </span><i>and</i><span> reign over us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-256'>[11] <span>But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</span></div>

<div id='verse-270'>[25] <span>And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[26] <span>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-272'>[27] <span>And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode </span><i>the grapes</i><span>, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[28] <span>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who </span><i>is</i><span> Abimelech, and who </span><i>is</i><span> Shechem, that we should serve him? </span><i>is</i><span> not </span><i>he</i><span> the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-274'>[29] <span>And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-275'>[30] <span>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[31] <span>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-277'>[32] <span>Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that </span><i>is</i><span> with thee, and lie in wait in the field:</span></div>

<div id='verse-279'>[34] <span>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-280'>[35] <span>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, from lying in wait.</span></div>

<div id='verse-281'>[36] <span>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as </span><i>if they were</i><span> men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[37] <span>And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[38] <span>Then said Zebul unto him, Where </span><i>is</i><span> now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who </span><i>is</i><span> Abimelech, that we should serve him? </span><i>is</i><span> not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[39] <span>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[40] <span>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown </span><i>and</i><span> wounded, </span><i>even</i><span> unto the entering of the gate.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[41] <span>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[42] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[43] <span>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people </span><i>were</i><span> come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[44] <span>And Abimelech, and the company that </span><i>was</i><span> with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two </span><i>other</i><span> companies ran upon all </span><i>the people</i><span> that </span><i>were</i><span> in the fields, and slew them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[45] <span>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that </span><i>was</i><span> therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[46] <span>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard </span><i>that</i><span>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[47] <span>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[48] <span>And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid </span><i>it</i><span> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, </span><i>and</i><span> do as I </span><i>have done</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[49] <span>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put </span><i>them</i><span> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[50] <span>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-296'>[51] <span>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut </span><i>it</i><span> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[52] <span>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[53] <span>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[54] <span>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[55] <span>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[56] <span>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[57] <span>And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span></div>

<div id='verse-321'>[1] <span>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he </span><i>was</i><span> the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-323'>[3] <span>Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-324'>[4] <span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-325'>[5] <span>And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</span></div>

<div id='verse-333'>[13] <span>And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those </span><i>lands</i><span> again peaceably.</span></div>

<div id='verse-334'>[14] <span>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</span></div>

<div id='verse-335'>[15] <span>And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</span></div>

<div id='verse-338'>[18] <span>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon </span><i>was</i><span> the border of Moab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-339'>[19] <span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-347'>[27] <span>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-348'>[28] <span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-349'>[29] <span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over </span><i>unto</i><span> the children of Ammon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-350'>[30] <span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</span></div>

<div id='verse-351'>[31] <span>Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</span></div>

<div id='verse-353'>[33] <span>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, </span><i>even</i><span> twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-354'>[34] <span>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she </span><i>was his</i><span> only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-355'>[35] <span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</span></div>

<div id='verse-356'>[36] <span>And she said unto him, My father, </span><i>if</i><span> thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, </span><i>even</i><span> of the children of Ammon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-357'>[37] <span>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</span></div>

<div id='verse-364'>[4] <span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites </span><i>are</i><span> fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, </span><i>and</i><span> among the Manassites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[5] <span>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was </span><i>so</i><span>, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, </span><i>Art</i><span> thou an Ephraimite?

<div id='verse-366'>[6] <span>Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce </span><i>it</i><span> right.

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-376'>[1] <span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-377'>[2] <span>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Manoah; and his wife </span><i>was</i><span> barren, and bare not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[3] <span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou </span><i>art</i><span> barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[4] <span>Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean </span><i>thing</i><span>:</span></div>

<div id='verse-380'>[5] <span>For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span></div>

<div id='verse-381'>[6] <span>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance </span><i>was</i><span> like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he </span><i>was</i><span>, neither told he me his name:</span></div>

<div id='verse-382'>[7] <span>But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean </span><i>thing</i><span>: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-383'>[8] <span>Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.</span></div>

<div id='verse-384'>[9] <span>And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband </span><i>was</i><span> not with her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[10] <span>And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the </span><i>other</i><span> day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-386'>[11] <span>And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, </span><i>Art</i><span> thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I </span><i>am</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[12] <span>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and </span><i>how</i><span> shall we do unto him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[13] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[14] <span>She may not eat of any </span><i>thing</i><span> that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean </span><i>thing</i><span>: all that I commanded her let her observe.</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[15] <span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-391'>[16] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he </span><i>was</i><span> an angel of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[17] <span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What </span><i>is</i><span> thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[18] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it </span><i>is</i><span> secret?</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[19] <span>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered </span><i>it</i><span> upon a rock unto the LORD: and </span><i>the angel</i><span> did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span></div>

<div id='verse-395'>[20] <span>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on </span><i>it</i><span>, and fell on their faces to the ground.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[21] <span>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he </span><i>was</i><span> an angel of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-397'>[22] <span>And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[23] <span>But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these </span><i>things</i><span>, nor would as at this time have told us </span><i>such things</i><span> as these.</span></div>

<div id='verse-399'>[24] <span>And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[25] <span>And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span></div>

<div id='verse-401'>[1] <span>And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.</span></div>

<div id='verse-402'>[2] <span>And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-403'>[3] <span>Then his father and his mother said unto him, </span><i>Is there</i><span> never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</span></div>

<div id='verse-404'>[4] <span>But his father and his mother knew not that it </span><i>was</i><span> of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-405'>[5] <span>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-406'>[6] <span>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and </span><i>he had</i><span> nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-407'>[7] <span>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</span></div>

<div id='verse-408'>[8] <span>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, </span><i>there was</i><span> a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-409'>[9] <span>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-410'>[10] <span>So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-411'>[11] <span>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-412'>[12] <span>And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find </span><i>it</i><span> out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</span></div>

<div id='verse-413'>[13] <span>But if ye cannot declare </span><i>it</i><span> me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-414'>[14] <span>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-415'>[15] <span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? </span><i>is it</i><span> not </span><i>so</i><span>?</span></div>

<div id='verse-416'>[16] <span>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told </span><i>it</i><span> me.

<div id='verse-417'>[17] <span>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-418'>[18] <span>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What </span><i>is</i><span> sweeter than honey? and what </span><i>is</i><span> stronger than a lion?

<div id='verse-419'>[19] <span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-421'>[1] <span>But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-422'>[2] <span>And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: </span><i>is</i><span> not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[4] <span>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</span></div>

<div id='verse-426'>[6] <span>Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-477'>[6] <span>In those days </span><i>there was</i><span> no king in Israel, </span><i>but</i><span> every man did </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in his own eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-481'>[10] <span>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten </span><i>shekels</i><span> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-482'>[11] <span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-485'>[1] <span>In those days </span><i>there was</i><span> no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day </span><i>all their</i><span> inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-486'>[2] <span>And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-487'>[3] <span>When they </span><i>were</i><span> by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this </span><i>place</i><span>? and what hast thou here?</span></div>

<div id='verse-488'>[4] <span>And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-489'>[5] <span>And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-490'>[6] <span>And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> your way wherein ye go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-491'>[7] <span>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that </span><i>were</i><span> therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and </span><i>there was</i><span> no magistrate in the land, that might put </span><i>them</i><span> to shame in </span><i>any</i><span> thing; and they </span><i>were</i><span> far from the Zidonians, and had no business with </span><i>any</i><span> man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-492'>[8] <span>And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What </span><i>say</i><span> ye?</span></div>

<div id='verse-493'>[9] <span>And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it </span><i>is</i><span> very good: and </span><i>are</i><span> ye still? be not slothful to go, </span><i>and</i><span> to enter to possess the land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-494'>[10] <span>When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where </span><i>there is</i><span> no want of any thing that </span><i>is</i><span> in the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-495'>[11] <span>And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.</span></div>

<div id='verse-496'>[12] <span>And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, </span><i>it is</i><span> behind Kirjathjearim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-497'>[13] <span>And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-498'>[14] <span>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-499'>[15] <span>And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, </span><i>even</i><span> unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-500'>[16] <span>And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which </span><i>were</i><span> of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.</span></div>

<div id='verse-501'>[17] <span>And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, </span><i>and</i><span> came in thither, </span><i>and</i><span> took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men </span><i>that were</i><span> appointed with weapons of war.</span></div>

<div id='verse-502'>[18] <span>And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?</span></div>

<div id='verse-503'>[19] <span>And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: </span><i>is it</i><span> better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?</span></div>

<div id='verse-504'>[20] <span>And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-505'>[21] <span>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-506'>[22] <i>And</i><span> when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that </span><i>were</i><span> in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-507'>[23] <span>And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?</span></div>

<div id='verse-508'>[24] <span>And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what </span><i>is</i><span> this </span><i>that</i><span> ye say unto me, What aileth thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-509'>[25] <span>And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.</span></div>

<div id='verse-510'>[26] <span>And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they </span><i>were</i><span> too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-511'>[27] <span>And they took </span><i>the things</i><span> which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people </span><i>that were</i><span> at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-512'>[28] <span>And </span><i>there was</i><span> no deliverer, because it </span><i>was</i><span> far from Zidon, and they had no business with </span><i>any</i><span> man; and it was in the valley that </span><i>lieth</i><span> by Bethrehob.

<div id='verse-513'>[29] <span>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city </span><i>was</i><span> Laish at the first.</span></div>

<div id='verse-514'>[30] <span>And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-515'>[31] <span>And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-516'>[1] <span>And it came to pass in those days, when </span><i>there was</i><span> no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-517'>[2] <span>And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.</span></div>

<div id='verse-518'>[3] <span>And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, </span><i>and</i><span> to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-519'>[4] <span>And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-520'>[5] <span>And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-521'>[6] <span>And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-522'>[7] <span>And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-523'>[8] <span>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-524'>[9] <span>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</span></div>

<div id='verse-525'>[10] <span>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which </span><i>is</i><span> Jerusalem; and </span><i>there were</i><span> with him two asses saddled, his concubine also </span><i>was</i><span> with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-526'>[11] <i>And</i><span> when they </span><i>were</i><span> by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-527'>[12] <span>And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that </span><i>is</i><span> not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-528'>[13] <span>And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-529'>[14] <span>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them </span><i>when they were</i><span> by Gibeah, which </span><i>belongeth</i><span> to Benjamin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-530'>[15] <span>And they turned aside thither, to go in </span><i>and</i><span> to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for </span><i>there was</i><span> no man that took them into his house to lodging.</span></div>

<div id='verse-531'>[16] <span>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which </span><i>was</i><span> also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place </span><i>were</i><span> Benjamites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-532'>[17] <span>And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?</span></div>

<div id='verse-533'>[18] <span>And he said unto him, We </span><i>are</i><span> passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence </span><i>am</i><span> I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I </span><i>am now</i><span> going to the house of the LORD; and there </span><i>is</i><span> no man that receiveth me to house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-534'>[19] <span>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man </span><i>which is</i><span> with thy servants: </span><i>there is</i><span> no want of any thing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-535'>[20] <span>And the old man said, Peace </span><i>be</i><span> with thee; howsoever </span><i>let</i><span> all thy wants </span><i>lie</i><span> upon me; only lodge not in the street.</span></div>

<div id='verse-536'>[21] <span>So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-537'>[22] <i>Now</i><span> as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, </span><i>and</i><span> beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-538'>[23] <span>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, </span><i>nay</i><span>, I pray you, do not </span><i>so</i><span> wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-539'>[24] <span>Behold, </span><i>here is</i><span> my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-540'>[25] <span>But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-541'>[26] <span>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord </span><i>was</i><span>, till it was light.</span></div>

<div id='verse-542'>[27] <span>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down </span><i>at</i><span> the door of the house, and her hands </span><i>were</i><span> upon the threshold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-543'>[28] <span>And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her </span><i>up</i><span> upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-544'>[29] <span>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, </span><i>together</i><span> with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-545'>[30] <span>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak </span><i>your minds</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-590'>[45] <span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-591'>[46] <span>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these </span><i>were</i><span> men of valour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-592'>[47] <span>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</span></div>

<div id='verse-593'>[48] <span>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of </span><i>every</i><span> city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-594'>[1] <span>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-595'>[2] <span>And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[3] <span>And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</span></div>

<div id='verse-597'>[4] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-598'>[5] <span>And the children of Israel said, Who </span><i>is there</i><span> among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-599'>[6] <span>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-600'>[7] <span>How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</span></div>

<div id='verse-601'>[8] <span>And they said, What one </span><i>is there</i><span> of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-602'>[9] <span>For the people were numbered, and, behold, </span><i>there were</i><span> none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-603'>[10] <span>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-604'>[11] <span>And this </span><i>is</i><span> the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-605'>[12] <span>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which </span><i>is</i><span> in the land of Canaan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-606'>[13] <span>And the whole congregation sent </span><i>some</i><span> to speak to the children of Benjamin that </span><i>were</i><span> in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-607'>[14] <span>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-608'>[15] <span>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-609'>[16] <span>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</span></div>

<div id='verse-610'>[17] <span>And they said, </span><i>There must be</i><span> an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-611'>[18] <span>Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed </span><i>be</i><span> he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-612'>[19] <span>Then they said, Behold, </span><i>there is</i><span> a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly </span><i>in a place</i><span> which </span><i>is</i><span> on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-613'>[20] <span>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</span></div>

<div id='verse-614'>[21] <span>And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-615'>[22] <span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, </span><i>that</i><span> ye should be guilty.</span></div>

<div id='verse-616'>[23] <span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took </span><i>them</i><span> wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-617'>[24] <span>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-618'>[25] <span>In those days </span><i>there was</i><span> no king in Israel: every man did </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in his own eyes.</span></div>
