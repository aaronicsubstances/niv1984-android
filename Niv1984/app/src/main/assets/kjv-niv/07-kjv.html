<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered </span><i>their meat</i><span> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before </span><i>was</i><span> Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before </span><i>was</i><span> Kirjathsepher:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And it came to pass, when she came </span><i>to him</i><span>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off </span><i>her</i><span> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which </span><i>lieth</i><span> in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out </span><i>the inhabitants of</i><span> the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD </span><i>was</i><span> with them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which </span><i>is</i><span> the name thereof unto this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Neither did Manasseh drive out </span><i>the inhabitants of</i><span> Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And the coast of the Amorites </span><i>was</i><span> from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, </span><i>being</i><span> an hundred and ten years old.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; </span><i>but</i><span> they did not so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, </span><i>that</i><span> they returned, and corrupted </span><i>themselves</i><span> more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of </span><i>his</i><span> seat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</span></div>
