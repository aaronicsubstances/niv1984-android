<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it </span><i>is</i><span> yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">3</a>]</sup><span> Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">4</a>]</sup><span> beside it.</span></div>

<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar."</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst </span><i>it is yet</i><span> morning: if he </span><i>be</i><span> a god, let him plead for himself, because </span><i>one</i><span> hath cast down his altar.</span></div>

<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred </span><i>shekels</i><span> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver </span><i>is</i><span> with me; I took it.

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, "Go, explore the land." The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?"</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When they </span><i>were</i><span> by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this </span><i>place</i><span>? and what hast thou here?</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest."</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?"</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: </span><i>is it</i><span> better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, `Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, </span><i>that</i><span> ye should be guilty.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took </span><i>them</i><span> wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</span></div>
