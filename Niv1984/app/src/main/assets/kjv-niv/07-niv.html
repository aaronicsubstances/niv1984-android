<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The LORD answered, "Judah is to go; I have given the land into their hands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their brothers, "Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the city. Therefore it was called Hormah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The men of Judah also took </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron--each city with its territory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, who remained among them; but they did subject them to forced labor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>and because of this the people of Asher lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> Pass to Sela and beyond.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be [thorns] in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and they called that place Bokim. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then the LORD raised up judges, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And the LORD said, "I will wait until you return."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of flour he made bread without yeast.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">c</a>]</sup><span> Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">d</a>]</sup><span> beside it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then build a proper kind of </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-5" id="niv-verse-6-5">e</a>]</sup><span> altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>They asked each other, "Who did this?" When they carefully investigated, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The men of the town demanded of Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So that day they called Gideon "Jerub-Baal, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-7" id="niv-verse-6-7">g</a>]</sup><span> " saying, "Let Baal contend with him," because he broke down Baal's altar.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-198'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-201'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>announce now to the people, `Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-202'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, `This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, `This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-203'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-204'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-205'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-207'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-208'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-209'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-211'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-212'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-213'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-214'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Watch me," he told them. "Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-216'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, `For the LORD and for Gideon.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-218'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-219'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-220'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-225'>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?" At this, their resentment against him subsided.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He said to the men of Succoth, "Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But the officials of Succoth said, "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then Gideon replied, "Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>From there he went up to Peniel </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So he said to the men of Peniel, "When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the elders of the town.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, `Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" "Men like you," they answered, "each one with the bearing of a prince."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Gideon replied, "Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do it yourself. `As is the man, so is his strength.'" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us--you, your son and your grandson--because you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But Gideon told them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And he said, "I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder." (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They answered, "We'll be glad to give them." So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>They gave him seventy shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers, who became his followers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>(His parents did not know that this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass. In it was a swarm of bees and some honey,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now his father went down to see the woman. And Samson made a feast there, as was customary for bridegrooms.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't really love me.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Samson said to them, "Since you've acted like this, I won't stop until I get my revenge on you."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The men of Judah asked, "Why have you come to fight us?" "We have come to take Samson prisoner," they answered, "to do to him as he did to us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Agreed," they answered. "We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-476'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-477'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Delilah then said to Samson, "Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me.

So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-485'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-3" id="niv-verse-16-3">c</a>]</sup><span> tightened it with the pin.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-486'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then she said to him, "How can you say, `I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him.</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-4" id="niv-verse-16-4">d</a>]</sup><span> And his strength left him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-499'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-519'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, "Go, explore the land." The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The priest answered them, "Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD's approval."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, "How did you find things?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They answered, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-530'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-531'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">c</a>]</sup><span> to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He replied, "You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, `What's the matter with you?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The Danites answered, "Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel--though the city used to be called Laish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, "Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!" So the two of them ate together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Now look, it's almost evening.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He added, "Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He answered, "We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants--me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"You are welcome at my house," the old man said. "Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads--the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>While the Benjamites were saying, "We are defeating them as before," the Israelites were saying, "Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-4" id="niv-verse-20-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of Gibeah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-5" id="niv-verse-20-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-618'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, "We are defeating them as in the first battle."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-6" id="niv-verse-20-6">f</a>]</sup><span> overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-634'>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: "Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The people went to Bethel, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"O LORD, the God of Israel," they cried, "why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then the Israelites asked, "Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD?" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-642'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: `Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, `Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit. </span></div>
