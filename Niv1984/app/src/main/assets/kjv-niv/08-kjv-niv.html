<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'><b>(NIV)</b> The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.

<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'><b>(NIV)</b> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'><b>(NIV)</b> "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."

<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'><b>(NIV)</b> But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'><b>(NIV)</b> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."

<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'><b>(NIV)</b> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'><b>(NIV)</b> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'><b>(NIV)</b> So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.

<h3>Ruth 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.

<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."

<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'><b>(NIV)</b> As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.
