<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the days when the judges ruled, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the name of the man </span><i>was</i><span> Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them and they wept aloud</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each </span><i>of you</i><span> in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people."</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? </span><i>are</i><span> there yet </span><i>any more</i><span> sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me--even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons--</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Turn again, my daughters, go </span><i>your way</i><span>; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, </span><i>if</i><span> I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!"</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, </span><i>or</i><span> to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people </span><i>shall be</i><span> my people, and thy God my God:</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, </span><i>if ought</i><span> but death part thee and me.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, </span><i>Is</i><span> this Naomi?</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Don't call me Naomi, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> " she told them. "Call me Mara, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> because the Almighty </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> has made my life very bitter.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">5</a>]</sup><span> me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me."</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why </span><i>then</i><span> call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</span></div>

<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name </span><i>was</i><span> Boaz.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after </span><i>him</i><span> in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field </span><i>belonging</i><span> unto Boaz, who </span><i>was</i><span> of the kindred of Elimelech.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!" "The LORD bless you!" they called back.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD </span><i>be</i><span> with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?"</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel </span><i>is</i><span> this?</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The foreman replied, "She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It </span><i>is</i><span> the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>She said, `Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Let</i><span> thine eyes </span><i>be</i><span> on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of </span><i>that</i><span> which the young men have drawn.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me--a foreigner?"</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I </span><i>am</i><span> a stranger?</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband--how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and </span><i>how</i><span> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant--though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls."</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched </span><i>corn</i><span>, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her."</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And let fall also </span><i>some</i><span> of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave </span><i>them</i><span>, that she may glean </span><i>them</i><span>, and rebuke her not.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she took </span><i>it</i><span> up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day </span><i>is</i><span> Boaz.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers."</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man </span><i>is</i><span> near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He even said to me, `Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed."</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, </span><i>It is</i><span> good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not try to find a home </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> for you, where you will be well provided for?</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now </span><i>is</i><span> not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: </span><i>but</i><span> make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do."</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"I will do whatever you say," Ruth answered.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer."</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Who </span><i>art</i><span> thou? And she answered, I </span><i>am</i><span> Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou </span><i>art</i><span> a near kinsman.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"The LORD bless you, my daughter," he replied. "This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> thou of the LORD, my daughter: </span><i>for</i><span> thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou </span><i>art</i><span> a virtuous woman.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now it is true that I </span><i>am thy</i><span> near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning."</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, </span><i>that</i><span> if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, </span><i>as</i><span> the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, "Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He also said, "Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">2</a>]</sup><span> went back to town.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Also he said, Bring the vail that </span><i>thou hast</i><span> upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six </span><i>measures</i><span> of barley, and laid </span><i>it</i><span> on her: and she went into the city.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who </span><i>art</i><span> thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and added, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, `Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsman-redeemer he had mentioned came along, Boaz said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here," and they did so.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which </span><i>was</i><span> our brother Elimelech's:</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line." "I will redeem it," he said.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy </span><i>it</i><span> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem </span><i>it</i><span>, redeem </span><i>it</i><span>: but if thou wilt not redeem </span><i>it, then</i><span> tell me, that I may know: for </span><i>there is</i><span> none to redeem </span><i>it</i><span> beside thee; and I </span><i>am</i><span> after thee. And he said, I will redeem </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you acquire </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup><span> the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property."</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy </span><i>it</i><span> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, "Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it."</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem </span><i>it</i><span> for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now this </span><i>was the manner</i><span> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> to his neighbour: and this </span><i>was</i><span> a testimony in Israel.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself." And he removed his sandal.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy </span><i>it</i><span> for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Boaz said unto the elders, and </span><i>unto</i><span> all the people, Ye </span><i>are</i><span> witnesses this day, that I have bought all that </span><i>was</i><span> Elimelech's, and all that </span><i>was</i><span> Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!"</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye </span><i>are</i><span> witnesses this day.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the elders and all those at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all the people that </span><i>were</i><span> in the gate, and the elders, said, </span><i>We are</i><span> witnesses.

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Through the offspring the LORD gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The women said to Naomi: "Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he shall be unto thee a restorer of </span><i>thy</i><span> life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The women living there said, "Naomi has a son." And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he </span><i>is</i><span> the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now these </span><i>are</i><span> the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
