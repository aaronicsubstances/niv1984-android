<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name </span><i>was</i><span> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And he had two wives; the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, </span><i>were</i><span> there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And </span><i>as</i><span> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? </span><i>am</i><span> not I better to thee than ten sons?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And she </span><i>was</i><span> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I </span><i>am</i><span> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant </span><i>thee</i><span> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more </span><i>sad</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, </span><i>I will not go up</i><span> until the child be weaned, and </span><i>then</i><span> I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child </span><i>was</i><span> young.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And she said, Oh my lord, </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, my lord, I </span><i>am</i><span> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <i>There is</i><span> none holy as the LORD: for </span><i>there is</i><span> none beside thee: neither </span><i>is there</i><span> any rock like our God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, </span><i>and</i><span> lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set </span><i>them</i><span> among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth </span><i>are</i><span> the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now the sons of Eli </span><i>were</i><span> sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the priests' custom with the people </span><i>was, that</i><span>, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And he struck </span><i>it</i><span> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And </span><i>if</i><span> any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and </span><i>then</i><span> take </span><i>as much</i><span> as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, </span><i>Nay</i><span>; but thou shalt give </span><i>it me</i><span> now: and if not, I will take </span><i>it</i><span> by force.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, </span><i>being</i><span> a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought </span><i>it</i><span> to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled </span><i>at</i><span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nay, my sons; for </span><i>it is</i><span> no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel </span><i>to be</i><span> my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded </span><i>in my</i><span> habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed </span><i>that</i><span> thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And this </span><i>shall be</i><span> a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-716'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched </span><i>corn</i><span>, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid </span><i>them</i><span> on asses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-749'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-750'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-751'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</span></div>
