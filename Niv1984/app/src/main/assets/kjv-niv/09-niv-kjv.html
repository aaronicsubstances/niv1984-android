<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name </span><i>was</i><span> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he had two wives; the name of the one </span><i>was</i><span> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, </span><i>were</i><span> there.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>as</i><span> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? </span><i>am</i><span> not I better to thee than ten sons?</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she </span><i>was</i><span> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I </span><i>am</i><span> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant </span><i>thee</i><span> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more </span><i>sad</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, </span><i>I will not go up</i><span> until the child be weaned, and </span><i>then</i><span> I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">5</a>]</sup><span> an ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">6</a>]</sup><span> of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child </span><i>was</i><span> young.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said, Oh my lord, </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, my lord, I </span><i>am</i><span> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there. </span></div>

<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</span></div>

<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. </span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"There is no one holy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. </span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <i>There is</i><span> none holy as the LORD: for </span><i>there is</i><span> none beside thee: neither </span><i>is there</i><span> any rock like our God.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. </span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let </span><i>not</i><span> arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The bows of the mighty men </span><i>are</i><span> broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. </span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <i>They that were</i><span> full have hired out themselves for bread; and </span><i>they that were</i><span> hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup><span> and raises up.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the sons of Eli </span><i>were</i><span> sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the priests' custom with the people </span><i>was, that</i><span>, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he struck </span><i>it</i><span> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>if</i><span> any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and </span><i>then</i><span> take </span><i>as much</i><span> as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, </span><i>Nay</i><span>; but thou shalt give </span><i>it me</i><span> now: and if not, I will take </span><i>it</i><span> by force.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup><span> were treating the LORD's offering with contempt.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Samuel was ministering before the LORD--a boy wearing a linen ephod.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, </span><i>being</i><span> a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought </span><i>it</i><span> to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled </span><i>at</i><span> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nay, my sons; for </span><i>it is</i><span> no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If a man sins against another man, God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">5</a>]</sup><span> may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel </span><i>to be</i><span> my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Why do you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">6</a>]</sup><span> scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded </span><i>in my</i><span> habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: `I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed </span><i>that</i><span> thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span></div>

<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line</span></div>

<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</span></div>

<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.</span></div>

<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And thou shalt see an enemy </span><i>in my</i><span> habitation, in all </span><i>the wealth</i><span> which </span><i>God</i><span> shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</span></div>

<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</span></div>

<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the man of thine, </span><i>whom</i><span> I shall not cut off from mine altar, </span><i>shall be</i><span> to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</span></div>

<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"`And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you--they will both die on the same day.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all Israel heard say </span><i>that</i><span> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and </span><i>that</i><span> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-4" id="niv-verse-13-4">4</a>]</sup><span> chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore.

And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and </span><i>that</i><span> thou camest not within the days appointed, and </span><i>that</i><span> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I thought, `Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Samuel left Gilgal </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-6" id="niv-verse-13-6">6</a>]</sup><span> and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people </span><i>that were</i><span> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make </span><i>them</i><span> swords or spears:</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-8" id="niv-verse-13-8">8</a>]</sup><span> sharpened.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that </span><i>was</i><span> upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">1</a>]</sup><span> that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, </span><i>and</i><span> behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed </span><i>but</i><span> thousands: and </span><i>what</i><span> can he have more but the kingdom?</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The next day an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">2</a>]</sup><span> spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul.

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and </span><i>there was</i><span> a javelin in Saul's hand.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall </span><i>with it</i><span>. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In everything he did he had great success, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">3</a>]</sup><span> because the LORD was with him.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD </span><i>was</i><span> with him.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Saul saw how successful </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">4</a>]</sup><span> he was, he was afraid of him.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said unto Saul, Who </span><i>am</i><span> I? and what </span><i>is</i><span> my life, </span><i>or</i><span> my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-5" id="niv-verse-18-5">5</a>]</sup><span> when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in </span><i>the one of</i><span> the twain.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, `Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'"</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul commanded his servants, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you </span><i>a</i><span> light </span><i>thing</i><span> to be a king's son in law, seeing that I </span><i>am</i><span> a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Saul's servants told him what David had said,</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul replied, "Say to David, `The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul saw and knew that the LORD </span><i>was</i><span> with David, and </span><i>that</i><span> Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-6" id="niv-verse-18-6">6</a>]</sup><span> than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, </span><i>that</i><span> David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret </span><i>place</i><span>, and hide thyself:</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou </span><i>art</i><span>, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works </span><i>have been</i><span> to thee-ward very good:</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest </span><i>it</i><span>, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">1</a>]</sup><span> spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with </span><i>his</i><span> hand.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Michal took an idol </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Michal took an image, and laid </span><i>it</i><span> in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' </span><i>hair</i><span> for his bolster, and covered </span><i>it</i><span> with a cloth.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He </span><i>is</i><span> sick.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul sent the messengers </span><i>again</i><span> to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the messengers were come in, behold, </span><i>there was</i><span> an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' </span><i>hair</i><span> for his bolster.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, `Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David </span><i>is</i><span> at Naioth in Ramah.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing </span><i>as</i><span> appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that </span><i>is</i><span> in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where </span><i>are</i><span> Samuel and David? And </span><i>one</i><span> said, Behold, </span><i>they be</i><span> at Naioth in Ramah.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, </span><i>Is</i><span> Saul also among the prophets?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what </span><i>is</i><span> mine iniquity? and what </span><i>is</i><span> my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it </span><i>is</i><span> not </span><i>so</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, `Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly </span><i>as</i><span> the LORD liveth, and </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, </span><i>there is</i><span> but a step between me and death.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do </span><i>it</i><span> for thee.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow </span><i>is</i><span> the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third </span><i>day</i><span> at even.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If your father misses me at all, tell him, `David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked </span><i>leave</i><span> of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for </span><i>there is</i><span> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If he says, `Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If he say thus, </span><i>It is</i><span> well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, </span><i>then</i><span> be sure that evil is determined by him.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what </span><i>if</i><span> thy father answer thee roughly?</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, </span><i>or</i><span> the third </span><i>day</i><span>, and, behold, </span><i>if there be</i><span> good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father </span><i>to do</i><span> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But </span><i>also</i><span> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Jonathan made </span><i>a covenant</i><span> with the house of David, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Let the LORD even require </span><i>it</i><span> at the hand of David's enemies.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow </span><i>is</i><span> the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>when</i><span> thou hast stayed three days, </span><i>then</i><span> thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was </span><i>in hand</i><span>, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I will shoot three arrows on the side </span><i>thereof</i><span>, as though I shot at a mark.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then I will send a boy and say, `Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And, behold, I will send a lad, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows </span><i>are</i><span> on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for </span><i>there is</i><span> peace to thee, and no hurt; </span><i>as</i><span> the LORD liveth.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if I say to the boy, `Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows </span><i>are</i><span> beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>as touching</i><span> the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD </span><i>be</i><span> between thee and me for ever.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, </span><i>even</i><span> upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean."</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he </span><i>is</i><span> not clean; surely he </span><i>is</i><span> not clean.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, </span><i>which was</i><span> the second </span><i>day</i><span> of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked </span><i>leave</i><span> of me </span><i>to go</i><span> to Bethlehem:</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He said, `Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."</span></div>

<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me </span><i>to be there</i><span>: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?</span></div>

<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious </span><i>woman</i><span>, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</span></div>

<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"</span></div>

<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</span></div>

<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.</span></div>

<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</span></div>

<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</span></div>

<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</span></div>

<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.</span></div>

<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</span></div>

<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</span></div>

<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</span></div>

<div>[36 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span></div>

<div>[36 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. </span><i>And</i><span> as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span></div>

<div>[37 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</span></div>

<div>[37 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, </span><i>Is</i><span> not the arrow beyond thee?</span></div>

<div>[38 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.</span></div>

<div>[38 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span></div>

<div>[39 <b>NIV</b>] <span>(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)</span></div>

<div>[39 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span></div>

<div>[40 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."</span></div>

<div>[40 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry </span><i>them</i><span> to the city.</span></div>

<div>[41 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side [of the stone] and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.</span></div>

<div>[41 <b>KJV</b>] <i>And</i><span> as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of </span><i>a place</i><span> toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why </span><i>art</i><span> thou alone, and no man with thee?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, `No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed </span><i>my</i><span> servants to such and such a place.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore what is under thine hand? give </span><i>me</i><span> five </span><i>loaves of</i><span> bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women."</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the priest answered David, and said, </span><i>There is</i><span> no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">1</a>]</sup><span> I set out. The men's things </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">2</a>]</sup><span> are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women </span><i>have been</i><span> kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and </span><i>the bread is</i><span> in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So the priest gave him hallowed </span><i>bread</i><span>: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul </span><i>was</i><span> there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name </span><i>was</i><span> Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that </span><i>belonged</i><span> to Saul.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it </span><i>is here</i><span> wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take </span><i>it</i><span>: for </span><i>there is</i><span> no other save that here. And David said, </span><i>There is</i><span> none like that; give it me.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the servants of Achish said unto him, </span><i>Is</i><span> not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore </span><i>then</i><span> have ye brought him to me?</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this </span><i>fellow</i><span> to play the mad man in my presence? shall this </span><i>fellow</i><span> come into my house?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And every one </span><i>that was</i><span> in distress, and every one that </span><i>was</i><span> in debt, and every one </span><i>that was</i><span> discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants </span><i>were</i><span> standing about him;)</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair."</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where </span><i>was</i><span> a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">1</a>]</sup><span> to you, `I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD."</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you.

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that </span><i>there is</i><span> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, </span><i>Is</i><span> this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said to David, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?"</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, </span><i>which is</i><span> before Jeshimon?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which </span><i>is</i><span> before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you," said Abishai.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice."</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not </span><i>smite</i><span> him the second time.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>David said furthermore, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go."</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that </span><i>is</i><span> at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw </span><i>it</i><span>, nor knew </span><i>it</i><span>, neither awaked: for they </span><i>were</i><span> all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space </span><i>being</i><span> between them:</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who </span><i>art</i><span> thou </span><i>that</i><span> criest to the king?</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said to Abner, </span><i>Art</i><span> not thou a </span><i>valiant</i><span> man? and who </span><i>is</i><span> like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?"</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This thing </span><i>is</i><span> not good that thou hast done. </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, ye </span><i>are</i><span> worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear </span><i>is</i><span>, and the cruse of water that </span><i>was</i><span> at his bolster.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king."</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, </span><i>Is</i><span> this thy voice, my son David? And David said, </span><i>It is</i><span> my voice, my lord, O king.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil </span><i>is</i><span> in mine hand?</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, `Go, serve other gods.'</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if </span><i>they be</i><span> the children of men, cursed </span><i>be</i><span> they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea--as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly."</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into </span><i>my</i><span> hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Saul said to David, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great </span><i>things</i><span>, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</span></div>

<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand."</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: </span><i>there is</i><span> nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</span></div>
