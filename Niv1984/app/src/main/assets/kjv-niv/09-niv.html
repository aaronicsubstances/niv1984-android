<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> an ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there. </span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-31'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[1] <span>Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[2] <span>"There is no one holy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[3] <span>"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[4] <span>"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[5] <span>Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[6] <span>"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and raises up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[7] <span>The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[8] <span>He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[9] <span>He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[10] <span>those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[11] <span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[12] <span>Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[13] <span>Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[14] <span>He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[15] <span>But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[16] <span>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[17] <span>This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> were treating the LORD's offering with contempt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[18] <span>But Samuel was ministering before the LORD--a boy wearing a linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[19] <span>Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[20] <span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[21] <span>And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[22] <span>Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[23] <span>So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[24] <span>No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[25] <span>If a man sins against another man, God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[26] <span>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[27] <span>Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[28] <span>I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[29] <span>Why do you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[30] <span>"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: `I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[31] <span>The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[32] <span>and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[33] <span>Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[34] <span>"`And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you--they will both die on the same day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[35] <span>I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[36] <span>Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-69'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[1] <span>The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[2] <span>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[3] <span>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[4] <span>Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[5] <span>And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[6] <span>Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[7] <span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[8] <span>The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[9] <span>So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, `Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[10] <span>The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[11] <span>And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[12] <span>At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[13] <span>For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and he failed to restrain them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[14] <span>Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, `The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[15] <span>Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[16] <span>but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[17] <span>"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[18] <span>So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[19] <span>The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[20] <span>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[21] <span>The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-92'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[1] <span>And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[2] <span>The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[3] <span>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the LORD's covenant from Shiloh, so that it </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[4] <span>So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[5] <span>When the ark of the LORD's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[6] <span>Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[7] <span>the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "We're in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[8] <span>Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[9] <span>Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[10] <span>So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[11] <span>The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[12] <span>That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh, his clothes torn and dust on his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[13] <span>When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[14] <span>Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[15] <span>who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes were set so that he could not see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'>[16] <span>He told Eli, "I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'>[17] <span>The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'>[18] <span>When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had led </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Israel forty years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[19] <span>His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'>[1] <span>After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'>[2] <span>Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'>[3] <span>When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120'>[4] <span>But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'>[5] <span>That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'>[6] <span>The LORD's hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'>[7] <span>When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'>[8] <span>So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'>[9] <span>But after they had moved it, the LORD's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'>[10] <span>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[11] <span>So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> will kill us and our people."

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-130'>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[1] <span>When the ark of the LORD had been in Philistine territory seven months,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[2] <span>the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it back to its place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[3] <span>They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[4] <span>The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[5] <span>Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and pay honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[6] <span>Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> treated them harshly, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'>[7] <span>"Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[8] <span>Take the ark of the LORD and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[9] <span>but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the LORD has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[10] <span>So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[11] <span>They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[12] <span>Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[13] <span>Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[14] <span>The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[15] <span>The Levites took down the ark of the LORD, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[16] <span>The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'>[17] <span>These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD--one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[18] <span>And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers--the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock, on which </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> they set the ark of the LORD, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[19] <span>But God struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of them to death because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the LORD had dealt them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[20] <span>and the men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[1] <span>So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD. They took it to Abinadab's house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[2] <span>It was a long time, twenty years in all, that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim, and all the people of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[3] <span>And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[4] <span>So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[5] <span>Then Samuel said, "Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the LORD for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[6] <span>When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel was leader </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of Israel at Mizpah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[7] <span>When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[8] <span>They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[9] <span>Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on Israel's behalf, and the LORD answered him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[10] <span>While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the LORD thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[11] <span>The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[12] <span>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> saying, "Thus far has the LORD helped us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[13] <span>So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[14] <span>The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-198'>[2] <span>He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites--a head taller than any of the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'>[3] <span>Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'>[4] <span>So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-201'>[5] <span>When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-202'>[6] <span>But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-203'>[7] <span>Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-204'>[8] <span>The servant answered him again.

I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-205'>[9] <span>(Formerly in Israel, if a man went to inquire of God, he would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'>[10] <span>"Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-207'>[11] <span>As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-208'>[12] <span>"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-209'>[13] <span>As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'>[14] <span>They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-211'>[15] <span>Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'>[19] <span>"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'>[25] <span>After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'>[26] <span>They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'>[1] <span>Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, "Has not the LORD anointed you leader over his inheritance? </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'>[2] <span>When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, `The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'>[3] <span>"Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'>[4] <span>They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'>[5] <span>"After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'>[6] <span>The Spirit of the LORD will come upon you in power, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'>[9] <span>As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'>[10] <span>When they arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he joined in their prophesying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'>[11] <span>When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'>[12] <span>A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'>[13] <span>After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'>[14] <span>Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'>[15] <span>Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'>[16] <span>Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[17] <span>Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the LORD at Mizpah</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[18] <span>and said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[19] <span>But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your calamities and distresses. And you have said, `No, set a king over us.' So now present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[20] <span>When Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[21] <span>Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[22] <span>So they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" And the LORD said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the baggage."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[23] <span>They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[24] <span>Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[25] <span>Samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[26] <span>Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[27] <span>But some troublemakers said, "How can this fellow save us?" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'>[1] <span>Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[2] <span>But Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[3] <span>The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[5] <span>Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, "What is wrong with the people? Why are they weeping?" Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[6] <span>When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he burned with anger.</span></div>

Then the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they turned out as one man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[8] <span>When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[9] <span>They told the messengers who had come, "Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, `By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be delivered.'" When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[10] <span>They said to the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever seems good to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[11] <span>The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[12] <span>The people then said to Samuel, "Who was it that asked, `Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring these men to us and we will put them to death."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'>[2] <span>Saul </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-3" id="niv-verse-13-3">c</a>]</sup><span> chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'>[3] <span>Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[4] <span>So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[5] <span>The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-4" id="niv-verse-13-4">d</a>]</sup><span> chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[6] <span>When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[7] <span>Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[8] <span>He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[9] <span>So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-5" id="niv-verse-13-5">e</a>]</sup><span> " And Saul offered up the burnt offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[10] <span>Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[11] <span>"What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[12] <span>I thought, `Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[13] <span>"You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'>[14] <span>But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'>[17] <span>Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317'>[19] <span>Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'>[21] <span>The price was two thirds of a shekel </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-9" id="niv-verse-13-9">i</a>]</sup><span> for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-10" id="niv-verse-13-10">j</a>]</sup><span> for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'>[11] <span>So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'>[12] <span>The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'>[13] <span>Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'>[14] <span>In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'>[15] <span>Then panic struck the whole army--those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties--and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-2" id="niv-verse-14-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'>[16] <span>Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'>[17] <span>Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'>[18] <span>Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.) </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'>[19] <span>While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'>[20] <span>Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'>[21] <span>Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'>[22] <span>When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'>[23] <span>So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'>[24] <span>Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'>[25] <span>The entire army </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">d</a>]</sup><span> entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'>[26] <span>When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'>[27] <span>But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-351'>[28] <span>Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, `Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352'>[29] <span>Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">f</a>]</sup><span> when I tasted a little of this honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'>[30] <span>How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'>[31] <span>That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'>[32] <span>They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'>[33] <span>Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'>[34] <span>Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, `Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'>[35] <span>Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'>[36] <span>Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'>[37] <span>So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'>[38] <span>Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'>[39] <span>As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the men said a word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'>[40] <span>Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," the men replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'>[41] <span>Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give me the right answer." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">g</a>]</sup><span> And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'>[42] <span>Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'>[43] <span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'>[44] <span>Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'>[45] <span>But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die--he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'>[46] <span>Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'>[47] <span>After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">h</a>]</sup><span> of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-9" id="niv-verse-14-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'>[48] <span>He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'>[49] <span>Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'>[50] <span>His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'>[51] <span>Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'>[52] <span>All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-377'>Chapter 15</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378'>[1] <span>Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one the LORD sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'>[2] <span>This is what the LORD Almighty says: `I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'>[3] <span>Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">a</a>]</sup><span> everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'>[4] <span>So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim--two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'>[5] <span>Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-383'>[6] <span>Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'>[7] <span>Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'>[8] <span>He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'>[9] <span>But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-2" id="niv-verse-15-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and lambs--everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-387'>[10] <span>Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-388'>[11] <span>"I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-389'>[12] <span>Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-390'>[13] <span>When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD's instructions."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-391'>[14] <span>But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'>[15] <span>Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'>[16] <span>"Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'>[17] <span>Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'>[18] <span>And he sent you on a mission, saying, `Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'>[19] <span>Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'>[20] <span>"But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'>[21] <span>The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'>[22] <span>But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'>[23] <span>For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'>[24] <span>Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-402'>[25] <span>Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-403'>[26] <span>But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-404'>[27] <span>As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'>[28] <span>Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors--to one better than you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-406'>[29] <span>He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-407'>[30] <span>Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-408'>[31] <span>So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-409'>[32] <span>Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him confidently, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-3" id="niv-verse-15-3">c</a>]</sup><span> thinking, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'>[33] <span>But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'>[34] <span>Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-412'>[35] <span>Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'>[2] <span>But Samuel said, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me." The LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'>[3] <span>Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'>[4] <span>Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'>[5] <span>Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'>[6] <span>When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'>[7] <span>But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'>[8] <span>Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'>[9] <span>Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has the LORD chosen this one."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'>[10] <span>Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "The LORD has not chosen these."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'>[12] <span>So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; he is the one."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'>[13] <span>So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'>[14] <span>Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-2" id="niv-verse-16-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirit from the LORD tormented him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[5] <span>He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-2" id="niv-verse-17-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[6] <span>on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'>[7] <span>His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-3" id="niv-verse-17-3">c</a>]</sup><span> His shield bearer went ahead of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[8] <span>Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[9] <span>If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[10] <span>Then the Philistine said, "This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[11] <span>On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[12] <span>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[13] <span>Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[14] <span>David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[15] <span>but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-455'>[16] <span>For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'>[17] <span>Now Jesse said to his son David, "Take this ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-4" id="niv-verse-17-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'>[18] <span>Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-5" id="niv-verse-17-5">e</a>]</sup><span> See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-6" id="niv-verse-17-6">f</a>]</sup><span> from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[19] <span>They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[20] <span>Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[21] <span>Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[22] <span>David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[23] <span>As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[24] <span>When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'>[25] <span>Now the Israelites had been saying, "Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'>[26] <span>David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-466'>[27] <span>They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[28] <span>When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[29] <span>"Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-469'>[30] <span>He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-470'>[31] <span>What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[32] <span>David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'>[33] <span>Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[34] <span>But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-474'>[35] <span>I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[36] <span>Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-476'>[37] <span>The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-477'>[38] <span>Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'>[39] <span>David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[40] <span>Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[41] <span>Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[42] <span>He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'>[43] <span>He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'>[44] <span>"Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'>[45] <span>David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-485'>[46] <span>This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-486'>[47] <span>All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'>[48] <span>As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-488'>[49] <span>Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'>[50] <span>So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[51] <span>David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'>[52] <span>Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-7" id="niv-verse-17-7">g</a>]</sup><span> and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'>[53] <span>When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-493'>[54] <span>David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-494'>[55] <span>As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, O king, I don't know."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-495'>[56] <span>The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-496'>[57] <span>As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-497'>[58] <span>"Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-499'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'>[1] <span>After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'>[2] <span>From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'>[3] <span>And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'>[4] <span>Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'>[5] <span>Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'>[6] <span>When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'>[7] <span>As they danced, they sang: "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[8] <span>Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'>[9] <span>And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[10] <span>The next day an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[11] <span>and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'>[12] <span>Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'>[13] <span>So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'>[14] <span>In everything he did he had great success, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">c</a>]</sup><span> because the LORD was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'>[15] <span>When Saul saw how successful </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">d</a>]</sup><span> he was, he was afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'>[16] <span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'>[17] <span>Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'>[18] <span>But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'>[19] <span>So </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-5" id="niv-verse-18-5">e</a>]</sup><span> when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'>[20] <span>Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'>[21] <span>"I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'>[22] <span>Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, `Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'>[23] <span>They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'>[24] <span>When Saul's servants told him what David had said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'>[25] <span>Saul replied, "Say to David, `The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'>[26] <span>When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'>[27] <span>David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'>[28] <span>When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'>[29] <span>Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'>[30] <span>The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-6" id="niv-verse-18-6">f</a>]</sup><span> than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-531'>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'>[1] <span>Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'>[2] <span>and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[3] <span>I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[4] <span>Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'>[5] <span>He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'>[6] <span>Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'>[7] <span>So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[8] <span>Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[9] <span>But an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'>[10] <span>Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'>[11] <span>Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'>[12] <span>So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'>[13] <span>Then Michal took an idol </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'>[14] <span>When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[15] <span>Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[16] <span>But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[17] <span>Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, `Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[18] <span>When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[19] <span>Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[20] <span>so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[21] <span>Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[22] <span>Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'>[23] <span>So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'>[24] <span>He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-557'>Chapter 20</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'>[1] <span>Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'>[2] <span>"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'>[3] <span>But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, `Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'>[4] <span>Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'>[5] <span>So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'>[6] <span>If your father misses me at all, tell him, `David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'>[7] <span>If he says, `Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'>[8] <span>As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'>[9] <span>"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'>[10] <span>David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'>[11] <span>"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'>[12] <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'>[13] <span>But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'>[14] <span>But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'>[15] <span>and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'>[16] <span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'>[17] <span>And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'>[18] <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'>[19] <span>The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'>[20] <span>I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'>[21] <span>Then I will send a boy and say, `Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'>[22] <span>But if I say to the boy, `Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'>[23] <span>And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'>[24] <span>So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'>[25] <span>He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'>[26] <span>Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'>[27] <span>But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'>[28] <span>Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'>[29] <span>He said, `Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'>[30] <span>Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'>[31] <span>As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'>[32] <span>"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'>[33] <span>But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'>[34] <span>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'>[35] <span>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'>[36] <span>and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'>[37] <span>When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'>[38] <span>Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'>[39] <span>(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'>[40] <span>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'>[41] <span>After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side [of the stone] and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'>[42] <span>Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, `The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-601'>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'>[1] <span>David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'>[2] <span>David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, `No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'>[3] <span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'>[4] <span>But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'>[5] <span>David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> I set out. The men's things </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup><span> are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'>[6] <span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'>[7] <span>Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'>[8] <span>David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-610'>[9] <span>The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-611'>[10] <span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'>[11] <span>But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'>[12] <span>David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'>[13] <span>So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'>[14] <span>Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'>[15] <span>Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-618'>Chapter 22</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'>[1] <span>David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'>[2] <span>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'>[3] <span>From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'>[4] <span>So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[5] <span>But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[6] <span>Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[7] <span>Saul said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[8] <span>Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'>[9] <span>But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'>[10] <span>Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[11] <span>Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[12] <span>Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." "Yes, my lord," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'>[13] <span>Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[14] <span>Ahimelech answered the king, "Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[15] <span>Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[16] <span>But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your father's whole family."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'>[17] <span>Then the king ordered the guards at his side: "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[18] <span>The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[19] <span>He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'>[20] <span>But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'>[21] <span>He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'>[22] <span>Then David said to Abiathar: "That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'>[23] <span>Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-643'>Chapter 23</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'>[1] <span>When David was told, "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'>[2] <span>he inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'>[3] <span>But David's men said to him, "Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'>[4] <span>Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, "Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'>[5] <span>So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'>[6] <span>(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'>[7] <span>Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'>[8] <span>And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'>[9] <span>When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'>[10] <span>David said, "O LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'>[11] <span>Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'>[12] <span>Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'>[13] <span>So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'>[14] <span>David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'>[15] <span>While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'>[16] <span>And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-660'>[17] <span>"Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-661'>[18] <span>The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-662'>[19] <span>The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-663'>[20] <span>Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-664'>[21] <span>Saul replied, "The LORD bless you for your concern for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-665'>[22] <span>Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-666'>[23] <span>Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-667'>[24] <span>So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-668'>[25] <span>Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-669'>[26] <span>Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-670'>[27] <span>a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-671'>[28] <span>Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-672'>[29] <span>And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-674'>Chapter 24</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675'>[1] <span>After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the Desert of En Gedi."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676'>[2] <span>So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-677'>[3] <span>He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678'>[4] <span>The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to you, `I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-679'>[5] <span>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680'>[6] <span>He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-681'>[7] <span>With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-682'>[8] <span>Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-683'>[9] <span>He said to Saul, "Why do you listen when men say, `David is bent on harming you'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-684'>[10] <span>This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, `I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the LORD's anointed.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-685'>[11] <span>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-686'>[12] <span>May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-687'>[13] <span>As the old saying goes, `From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-688'>[14] <span>"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-689'>[15] <span>May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-690'>[16] <span>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-691'>[17] <span>"You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-692'>[18] <span>You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'>[19] <span>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'>[20] <span>I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'>[21] <span>Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'>[22] <span>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-698'>Chapter 25</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'>[1] <span>Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-1" id="niv-verse-25-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700'>[2] <span>A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701'>[3] <span>His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-702'>[4] <span>While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703'>[5] <span>So he sent ten young men and said to them, "Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-704'>[6] <span>Say to him: `Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-705'>[7] <span>"`Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-706'>[8] <span>Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-707'>[9] <span>When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-708'>[10] <span>Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-709'>[11] <span>Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-710'>[12] <span>David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-711'>[13] <span>David said to his men, "Put on your swords!" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'>[14] <span>One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: "David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-713'>[15] <span>Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-714'>[16] <span>Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-715'>[17] <span>Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-716'>[18] <span>Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-2" id="niv-verse-25-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-717'>[19] <span>Then she told her servants, "Go on ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'>[20] <span>As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'>[21] <span>David had just said, "It's been useless--all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-720'>[22] <span>May God deal with David, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-3" id="niv-verse-25-3">c</a>]</sup><span> be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-721'>[23] <span>When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-722'>[24] <span>She fell at his feet and said: "My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-723'>[25] <span>May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name--his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'>[26] <span>"Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'>[27] <span>And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-726'>[28] <span>Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727'>[29] <span>Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'>[30] <span>When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-729'>[31] <span>my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-730'>[32] <span>David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-731'>[33] <span>May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-732'>[34] <span>Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-733'>[35] <span>Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-734'>[36] <span>When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'>[37] <span>Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-736'>[38] <span>About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'>[39] <span>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'>[40] <span>His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'>[41] <span>She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'>[42] <span>Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'>[43] <span>David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-742'>[44] <span>But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-4" id="niv-verse-25-4">d</a>]</sup><span> son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-744'>Chapter 26</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-745'>[1] <span>The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-746'>[2] <span>So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'>[3] <span>Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-748'>[4] <span>he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'>[5] <span>Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'>[6] <span>David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you," said Abishai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-751'>[7] <span>So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'>[8] <span>Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-753'>[9] <span>But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-754'>[10] <span>As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-755'>[11] <span>But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-756'>[12] <span>So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-757'>[13] <span>Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-758'>[14] <span>He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-759'>[15] <span>David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-760'>[16] <span>What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-761'>[17] <span>Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-762'>[18] <span>And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-763'>[19] <span>Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, `Go, serve other gods.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-764'>[20] <span>Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea--as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-765'>[21] <span>Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-766'>[22] <span>"Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-767'>[23] <span>The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-768'>[24] <span>As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-769'>[25] <span>Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-771'>Chapter 27</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-772'>[1] <span>But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-773'>[2] <span>So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-774'>[3] <span>David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-775'>[4] <span>When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-776'>[5] <span>Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-777'>[6] <span>So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778'>[7] <span>David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-779'>[8] <span>Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-780'>[9] <span>Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-781'>[10] <span>When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-782'>[11] <span>He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, `This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-783'>[12] <span>Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant forever."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-786'>[1] <span>In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787'>[2] <span>David said, "Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do." Achish replied, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-788'>[3] <span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-789'>[4] <span>The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-790'>[5] <span>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-791'>[6] <span>He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-792'>[7] <span>Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her." "There is one in Endor," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-793'>[8] <span>So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-794'>[9] <span>But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-795'>[10] <span>Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-796'>[11] <span>Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" "Bring up Samuel," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797'>[12] <span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-798'>[13] <span>The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said, "I see a spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-1" id="niv-verse-28-1">a</a>]</sup><span> coming up out of the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799'>[14] <span>"What does he look like?" he asked. "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800'>[15] <span>Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'>[16] <span>Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'>[17] <span>The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors--to David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'>[18] <span>Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'>[19] <span>The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805'>[20] <span>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'>[21] <span>When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, "Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'>[22] <span>Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'>[23] <span>He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'>[24] <span>The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813'>[1] <span>The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814'>[2] <span>As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'>[3] <span>The commanders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish replied, "Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-816'>[4] <span>But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master's favor than by taking the heads of our own men?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-817'>[5] <span>Isn't this the David they sang about in their dances: "`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-818'>[6] <span>So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-819'>[7] <span>Turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'>[8] <span>"But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'>[9] <span>Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, `He must not go up with us into battle.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'>[10] <span>Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-823'>[11] <span>So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-825'>Chapter 30</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'>[1] <span>David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'>[2] <span>and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'>[3] <span>When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'>[4] <span>So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'>[5] <span>David's two wives had been captured--Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'>[6] <span>David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'>[7] <span>Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'>[8] <span>and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" "Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'>[9] <span>David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'>[10] <span>for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'>[11] <span>They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'>[12] <span>part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'>[13] <span>David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'>[14] <span>We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[15] <span>David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'>[16] <span>He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'>[17] <span>David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'>[18] <span>David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'>[19] <span>Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'>[20] <span>He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'>[21] <span>Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'>[22] <span>But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'>[23] <span>David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'>[24] <span>Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'>[25] <span>David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'>[26] <span>When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a present for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'>[27] <span>He sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-860'>[2] <span>The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-861'>[3] <span>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-862'>[4] <span>Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863'>[5] <span>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867'>[9] <span>They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.</span></div>
