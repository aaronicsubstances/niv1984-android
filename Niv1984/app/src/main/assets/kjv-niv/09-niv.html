<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> an ephah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there. </span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-31'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"There is no one holy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and raises up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> were treating the LORD's offering with contempt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But Samuel was ministering before the LORD--a boy wearing a linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>If a man sins against another man, God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Why do you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: `I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"`And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you--they will both die on the same day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-69'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, `Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the LORD said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and he failed to restrain them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, `The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-207'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-213'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-214'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-216'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and all your father's family?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-220'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul.

And Saul dined with Samuel that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"--and the servant did so--"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-4" id="niv-verse-13-4">d</a>]</sup><span> chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-5" id="niv-verse-13-5">e</a>]</sup><span> " And Saul offered up the burnt offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I thought, `Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Samuel left Gilgal </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-6" id="niv-verse-13-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-314'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-7" id="niv-verse-13-7">g</a>]</sup><span> in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-8" id="niv-verse-13-8">h</a>]</sup><span> sharpened.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-323'>Chapter 14</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jonathan said, "Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If they say to us, `Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But if they say, `Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then panic struck the whole army--those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties--and the ground shook.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.) </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The entire army </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">d</a>]</sup><span> entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-5" id="niv-verse-14-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-351'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, `Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">f</a>]</sup><span> when I tasted a little of this honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, `Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the men said a word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," the men replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give me the right answer." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">g</a>]</sup><span> And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die--he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">h</a>]</sup><span> of Zobah, and the Philistines.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But Samuel said, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me." The LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD's anointed stands here before the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," Jesse answered, "but he is tending the sheep."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-499'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As they danced, they sang: "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The next day an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In everything he did he had great success, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">c</a>]</sup><span> because the LORD was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When Saul saw how successful </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">d</a>]</sup><span> he was, he was afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-5" id="niv-verse-18-5">e</a>]</sup><span> when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, `Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When Saul's servants told him what David had said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Saul replied, "Say to David, `The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-6" id="niv-verse-18-6">f</a>]</sup><span> than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-531'>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Michal took an idol </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, `Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, `Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.'

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If your father misses me at all, tell him, `David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>If he says, `Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then Jonathan said to David: "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.</span></div>

If I say to him, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But if I say to the boy, `Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>He said, `Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman!

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side [of the stone] and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, `The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'"

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-601'>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, `No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> I set out. The men's things </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup><span> are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-610'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-611'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances: "`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Saul said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." "Yes, my lord," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Ahimelech answered the king, "Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your father's whole family."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the king ordered the guards at his side: "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then David said to Abiathar: "That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-643'>Chapter 23</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When David was told, "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>he inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But David's men said to him, "Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, "Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>David said, "O LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-660'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-661'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-662'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-663'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-664'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Saul replied, "The LORD bless you for your concern for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-665'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-666'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-667'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-668'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-669'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-670'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-671'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the Desert of En Gedi."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-677'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to you, `I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-679'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-681'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-682'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-683'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He said to Saul, "Why do you listen when men say, `David is bent on harming you'?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-685'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-686'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-690'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-691'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: "David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-713'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-714'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-715'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-716'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-2" id="niv-verse-25-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-717'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then she told her servants, "Go on ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>David had just said, "It's been useless--all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>She fell at his feet and said: "My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name--his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-745'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-746'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-748'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you," said Abishai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-751'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-753'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-754'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-755'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-756'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-757'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-758'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-759'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-760'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>What you have done is not good.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-761'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-762'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-763'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, `Go, serve other gods.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-764'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea--as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-765'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-766'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-767'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-768'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-769'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-772'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-773'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-774'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-775'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-776'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-777'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-779'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-780'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-781'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-782'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, `This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-783'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant forever."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>David said, "Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do." Achish replied, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-788'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-789'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-790'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-791'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-792'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her." "There is one in Endor," they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-793'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-794'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-796'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" "Bring up Samuel," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-798'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said, "I see a spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-1" id="niv-verse-28-1">a</a>]</sup><span> coming up out of the ground."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"What does he look like?" he asked. "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors--to David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-818'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-819'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, `He must not go up with us into battle.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-823'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-825'>Chapter 30</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>David's two wives had been captured--Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" "Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a present for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>and Racal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites;</span></div>
