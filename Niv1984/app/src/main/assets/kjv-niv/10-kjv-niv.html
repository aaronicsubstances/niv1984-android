<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-9-2'><b>(NIV)</b> Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba. They called him to appear before David, and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" "Your servant," he replied.

<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-9-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-9-3'><b>(NIV)</b> The king asked, "Is there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet."

<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-9-4'><b>(NIV)</b> "Where is he?" the king asked. Ziba answered, "He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar."

<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-9-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.</i>
