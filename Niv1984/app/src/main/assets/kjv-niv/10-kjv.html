<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and </span><i>so</i><span> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here </span><i>am</i><span> I.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he said unto me, Who </span><i>art</i><span> thou? And I answered him, I </span><i>am</i><span> an Amalekite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life </span><i>is</i><span> yet whole in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that </span><i>was</i><span> upon his head, and the bracelet that </span><i>was</i><span> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence </span><i>art</i><span> thou? And he answered, I </span><i>am</i><span> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, </span><i>and</i><span> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And David said unto him, Thy blood </span><i>be</i><span> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah </span><i>the use of</i><span> the bow: behold, </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the book of Jasher.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Tell </span><i>it</i><span> not in Gath, publish </span><i>it</i><span> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, </span><i>let there be</i><span> no dew, neither </span><i>let there be</i><span> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, </span><i>as though he had</i><span> not </span><i>been</i><span> anointed with oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Saul and Jonathan </span><i>were</i><span> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with </span><i>other</i><span> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, </span><i>thou wast</i><span> slain in thine high places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And his men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, </span><i>That</i><span> the men of Jabeshgilead </span><i>were they</i><span> that buried Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Saul, and have buried him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Ishbosheth Saul's son </span><i>was</i><span> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which </span><i>pertained</i><span> to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and </span><i>thrust</i><span> his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which </span><i>is</i><span> in Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel </span><i>was as</i><span> light of foot as a wild roe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, </span><i>Art</i><span> thou Asahel? And he answered, I </span><i>am</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth </span><i>rib</i><span>, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that </span><i>lieth</i><span> before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And Joab said, </span><i>As</i><span> God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, </span><i>so that</i><span> three hundred and threescore men died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which </span><i>was in</i><span> Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, </span><i>Am</i><span> I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose </span><i>is</i><span> the land? saying </span><i>also</i><span>, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand </span><i>shall be</i><span> with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver </span><i>me</i><span> my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from </span><i>her</i><span> husband, </span><i>even</i><span> from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past </span><i>to be</i><span> king over you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now then do </span><i>it</i><span>: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that </span><i>were</i><span> with him a feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from </span><i>pursuing</i><span> a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner </span><i>was</i><span> not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When Joab and all the host that </span><i>was</i><span> with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why </span><i>is</i><span> it </span><i>that</i><span> thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth </span><i>rib</i><span>, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And afterward when David heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he said, I and my kingdom </span><i>are</i><span> guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-321'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-322'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she </span><i>was</i><span> a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-323'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab </span><i>was</i><span> a very subtil man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-324'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he said unto him, Why </span><i>art</i><span> thou, </span><i>being</i><span> the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-325'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see </span><i>it</i><span>, and eat </span><i>it</i><span> at her hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-326'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-327'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded </span><i>it</i><span>, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-331'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when she had brought </span><i>them</i><span> unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-332'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-333'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this </span><i>woman</i><span> out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-339'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that </span><i>was</i><span> on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he </span><i>is</i><span> thy brother; regard not this thing.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-341'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-346'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-347'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-348'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-349'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which </span><i>was</i><span> with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see </span><i>it</i><span>: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that </span><i>lieth</i><span> in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, </span><i>even</i><span> to Beersheba.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-725'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah </span><i>were</i><span> five hundred thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-728'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-729'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three </span><i>things</i><span>; choose thee one of them, that I may </span><i>do it</i><span> unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies </span><i>are</i><span> great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what </span><i>seemeth</i><span> good unto him: behold, </span><i>here be</i><span> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and </span><i>other</i><span> instruments of the oxen for wood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>All these </span><i>things</i><span> did Araunah, </span><i>as</i><span> a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy </span><i>it</i><span> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-742'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span></div>
