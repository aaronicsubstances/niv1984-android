<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</i>
