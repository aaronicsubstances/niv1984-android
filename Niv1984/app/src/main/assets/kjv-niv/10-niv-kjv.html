<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead."</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed </span><i>himself</i><span>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said his servants unto him, What thing </span><i>is</i><span> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, </span><i>while it was</i><span> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, `Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.'</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she </span><i>was</i><span> a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab </span><i>was</i><span> a very subtil man.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto him, Why </span><i>art</i><span> thou, </span><i>being</i><span> the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, `I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see </span><i>it</i><span>, and eat </span><i>it</i><span> at her hand.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her </span><i>was</i><span> greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she said unto him, </span><i>There is</i><span> no cause: this evil in sending me away </span><i>is</i><span> greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her."</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">2</a>]</sup><span> robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that </span><i>was</i><span> on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he </span><i>is</i><span> thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When King David heard all this, he was furious.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there.</span></div>
