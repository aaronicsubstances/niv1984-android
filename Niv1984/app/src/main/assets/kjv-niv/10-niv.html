<h3>2 Samuel 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>"Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>"What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." He said, "The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, `What can I do?'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>"He asked me, `Who are you?' "`An Amalekite,' I answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>"Then he said to me, `Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite," he answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>David asked him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, `I killed the LORD's anointed.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings [of grain]. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul--no longer rubbed with oil.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'>"Saul and Jonathan-- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'>"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'>"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-1-26'>I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-1-27'>"How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!"

<h3>2 Samuel 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'>In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'>David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'>he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'>May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'>Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'>He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_1">1</a>]</sup> and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'>Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'>The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'>Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'>Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'>So they stood up and were counted off--twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'>Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_2">2</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'>The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-2-18'>The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'>He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-2-20'>Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-2-21'>Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-2-22'>Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-2-23'>But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-2-24'>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-2-25'>Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-2-26'>Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-2-27'>Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_3">3</a>]</sup> "
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-2-28'>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-2-29'>All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_4">4</a>]</sup> and came to Mahanaim.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-2-30'>Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-2-31'>But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-2-32'>They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.

<h3>2 Samuel 3</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-3-1'>The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-3-2'>Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-3-3'>his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-3-4'>the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-3-5'>and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-3-6'>During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-3-7'>Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-3-8'>Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am I a dog's head--on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-3-9'>May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-3-10'>and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-3-11'>Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-3-12'>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-3-13'>"Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-3-14'>Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-3-15'>So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-3-16'>Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-3-17'>Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-3-18'>Now do it! For the LORD promised David, `By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-3-19'>Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-3-20'>When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-3-21'>Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-3-22'>Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-3-23'>When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-3-24'>So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-3-25'>You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-3-26'>Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-3-27'>Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-3-28'>Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-3-29'>May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house! May Joab's house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_681052708_1">1</a>]</sup> or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-3-30'>(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-3-31'>Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-3-32'>They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-3-33'>The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died as the lawless die?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-3-34'>Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men." And all the people wept over him again.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-3-35'>Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-3-36'>All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-3-37'>So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-3-38'>Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-3-39'>And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-4-2'>Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Recab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin--Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-4-5'>Now Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-4-6'>They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah slipped away.

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-4-8'>They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to take your life. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-4-9'>David answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of all trouble,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-10-2'>David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to the land of the Ammonites,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-10-3'>the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Hasn't David sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-10-4'>So Hanun seized David's men, shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-10-5'>When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-10-6'>When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-10-7'>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-10-8'>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-10-9'>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-10-10'>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-10-11'>Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-10-12'>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-11-2'>One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-11-3'>and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-11-4'>Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-11-5'>The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant."
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-11-7'>When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-11-8'>Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-11-9'>But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-11-10'>When David was told, "Uriah did not go home," he asked him, "Haven't you just come from a distance? Why didn't you go home?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-11-11'>Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-11-12'>Then David said to him, "Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-11-13'>At David's invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-12-2'>The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-12-3'>but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-12-4'>"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-12-5'>David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-12-6'>He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-12-7'>Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-12-8'>I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-12-9'>Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.

<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-12-10'>Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'

<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-12-11'>"This is what the LORD says: `Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-12-12'>You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-12-13'>Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-12-18'>On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-12-19'>David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-12-21'>His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-12-22'>He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, `Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-12-23'>But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-12-24'>Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him;

<h3>2 Samuel 14</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-14-1'>Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart longed for Absalom.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-14-2'>So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don't use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-14-3'>Then go to the king and speak these words to him." And Joab put the words in her mouth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-14-4'>When the woman from Tekoa went 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_161361841_1">1</a>]</sup> to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, "Help me, O king!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-14-5'>The king asked her, "What is troubling you?" She said, "I am indeed a widow; my husband is dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-14-6'>I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.

<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-14-7'>Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, `Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.' They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-14-8'>The king said to the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-14-9'>But the woman from Tekoa said to him, "My lord the king, let the blame rest on me and on my father's family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-14-10'>The king replied, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-14-11'>She said, "Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed." "As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "not one hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-14-12'>Then the woman said, "Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." "Speak," he replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-14-13'>The woman said, "Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-14-14'>Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.

<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-14-15'>"And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, `I will speak to the king; perhaps he will do what his servant asks.

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-14-18'>Then the king said to the woman, "Do not keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you." "Let my lord the king speak," the woman said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-14-19'>The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-14-20'>Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God--he knows everything that happens in the land."

<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-14-21'>The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-14-22'>Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-14-23'>Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-14-24'>But the king said, "He must go to his own house; he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-14-27'>Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. The daughter's name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-14-28'>Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-14-29'>Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-14-30'>Then he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-14-31'>Then Joab did go to Absalom's house and he said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-14-32'>Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent word to you and said, `Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur?

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-14-33'>So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

<h3>2 Samuel 15</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-15-1'>In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-15-2'>He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, "What town are you from?" He would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-15-3'>Then Absalom would say to him, "Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-15-4'>And Absalom would add, "If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-15-5'>Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-15-6'>Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-15-7'>At the end of four

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-15-9'>The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he went to Hebron.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-15-10'>Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, `Absalom is king in Hebron.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-15-11'>Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-15-12'>While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing.

<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-15-13'>A messenger came and told David, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-15-14'>Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword."

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-15-18'>All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.

<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-15-20'>You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you."

<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-15-23'>The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the desert.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-15-24'>Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-15-25'>Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-15-26'>But if he says, `I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-15-27'>The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. You and Abiathar take your two sons with you.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-15-31'>Now David had been told, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-16-2'>The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-16-3'>The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, `Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-18-2'>David sent the troops out--a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, "I myself will surely march out with you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-18-3'>But the men said, "You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care; but you are worth ten thousand of us.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-18-4'>The king answered, "I will do whatever seems best to you." So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-18-5'>The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-18-6'>The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-18-7'>There the army of Israel was defeated by David's men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-18-8'>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-18-9'>Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-18-10'>When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-18-11'>Joab said to the man who had told him this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels

<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-18-12'>But the man replied, "Even if a thousand shekels

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-18-18'>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-18-19'>Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-18-23'>He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-18-24'>While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-18-26'>Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He must be bringing good news, too."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-18-27'>The watchman said, "It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok." "He's a good man," the king said. "He comes with good news."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-18-28'>Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-18-29'>The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-18-30'>The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-18-31'>Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you."
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-18-33'>The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!"

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-20-2'>So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.

<h3>2 Samuel 23</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-23-1'>These are the last words of David: "The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, Israel's singer of songs 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_1">1</a>]</sup> :
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-23-2'>"The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; his word was on my tongue.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-23-3'>The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me: `When one rules over men in righteousness, when he rules in the fear of God,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-23-4'>he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings the grass from the earth.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-23-5'>"Is not my house right with God? Has he not made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part? Will he not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-23-6'>But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, which are not gathered with the hand.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-23-7'>Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; they are burned up where they lie."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-23-8'>These are the names of David's mighty men: Josheb-Basshebeth, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_2">2</a>]</sup> a Tahkemonite, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_3">3</a>]</sup> was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_4">4</a>]</sup> in one encounter.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-23-9'>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered [at Pas Dammim] 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_5">5</a>]</sup> for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-23-10'>but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-23-11'>Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-23-12'>But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-23-13'>During harvest time, three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-23-14'>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-23-15'>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-23-16'>So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-23-17'>"Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-23-18'>Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_6">6</a>]</sup> He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-23-19'>Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-23-20'>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-23-21'>And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-23-22'>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-23-23'>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

<h3>2 Samuel 24</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-24-1'>Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-24-2'>So the king said to Joab and the army commanders 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_1">1</a>]</sup> with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-24-3'>But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-24-4'>The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-24-5'>After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-24-6'>They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-24-7'>Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-24-8'>After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-24-9'>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-24-10'>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-24-11'>Before David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David's seer:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-24-12'>"Go and tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-24-13'>So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come upon you three 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_2">2</a>]</sup> years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-24-14'>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-24-15'>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-24-16'>When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-24-17'>When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-24-18'>On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-24-19'>So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-24-20'>When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-24-21'>Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" "To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-24-22'>Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-24-23'>O king, Araunah gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the LORD your God accept you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-24-24'>But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_3">3</a>]</sup> of silver for them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-24-25'>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
