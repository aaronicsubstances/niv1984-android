<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." He said, "The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, `What can I do?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"He asked me, `Who are you?' "`An Amalekite,' I answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Then he said to me, `Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>David asked him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, `I killed the LORD's anointed.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings [of grain]. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul--no longer rubbed with oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"Saul and Jonathan-- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. </span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-30'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So they stood up and were counted off--twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and came to Mahanaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am I a dog's head--on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now do it! For the LORD promised David, `By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house! May Joab's house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died as the lawless die?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men." And all the people wept over him again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>David asked, "Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So David sent this word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent him to David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-320'>Chapter 13</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, `I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"Don't, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup><span> robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup><span> robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When King David heard all this, he was furious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Absalom ordered his men, "Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, `Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>While they were on their way, the report came to David: "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-351'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, "I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-3" id="niv-verse-13-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And the spirit of the king </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-4" id="niv-verse-13-4">d</a>]</sup><span> longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart longed for Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then go to the king and speak these words to him." And Joab put the words in her mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When the woman from Tekoa went </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, "Help me, O king!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The king asked her, "What is troubling you?" She said, "I am indeed a widow; my husband is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, `Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.'

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The king said to the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But the woman from Tekoa said to him, "My lord the king, let the blame rest on me and on my father's family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The king replied, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>She said, "Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the woman said, "Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." "Speak," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The woman said, "Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the king said to the woman, "Do not keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you." "Let my lord the king speak," the woman said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God--he knows everything that happens in the land."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But the king said, "He must go to his own house; he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, `Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." "I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He pelted David and all the king's officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David's right and left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you man of blood, you scoundrel!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the king said, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, `Curse David,' who can ask, `Why do you do this?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, who is of my own flesh, is trying to take my life.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>It may be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Ahithophel answered, "Lie with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he lay with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-497'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-498'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>There the army of Israel was defeated by David's men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-499'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Joab said to the man who had told him this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of silver and a warrior's belt."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But the man replied, "Even if a thousand shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">c</a>]</sup><span> were weighed out into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, `Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">d</a>]</sup><span> '</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And if I had put my life in jeopardy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-5" id="niv-verse-18-5">e</a>]</sup><span> --and nothing is hidden from the king--you would have kept your distance from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like this for you." So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"You are not the one to take the news today," Joab told him. "You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king's son is dead."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, "Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite." But Joab replied, "My son, why do you want to go? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-6" id="niv-verse-18-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and outran the Cushite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, "If he is alone, he must have good news." And the man came closer and closer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He must be bringing good news, too."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The watchman said, "It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok." "He's a good man," the king said. "He comes with good news."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, "The king is grieving for his son."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-530'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The king covered his face and cried aloud, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-531'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, "Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, "The king is sitting in the gateway," they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Throughout the tribes of Israel, the people were all arguing with each other, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country because of Absalom;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: "Ask the elders of Judah, `Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And say to Amasa, `Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They crossed at the ford to take the king's household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and said to him, "May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first of the whole house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD's anointed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>David replied, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king promised him on oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>He said, "My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, `I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But Ziba my servant betrayed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever pleases you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>All my grandfather's descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who sat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The king said to him, "Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the fields."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has arrived home safely."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Now Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of men and women singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever pleases you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>The king said, "Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai returned to his home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king's provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king; and besides, we have a greater claim on David than you have. So why do you treat us with contempt? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah responded even more harshly than the men of Israel.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-571'>Chapter 20</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son! Every man to his tent, O Israel!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them, but did not lie with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Joab's men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab's hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>One of Joab's men stood beside Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>After Amasa had been removed from the road, all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maacah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He went toward her, and she asked, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he answered. She said, "Listen to what your servant has to say." "I'm listening," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>She continued, "Long ago they used to say, `Get your answer at Abel,' and that settled it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the LORD's inheritance?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Far be it from me!" Joab replied, "Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I'll withdraw from the city."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it to Joab.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-600'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, "It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-601'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to [spare] them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>David asked the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death." "What do you want me to do for you?" David asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They answered the king, "As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul--the Lord's chosen one." So the king said, "I will give them to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot--twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So the king said to Joab and the army commanders </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Before David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David's seer:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-729'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"Go and tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come upon you three </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-2" id="niv-verse-24-2">b</a>]</sup><span> years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" "To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>O king, Araunah gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the LORD your God accept you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-3" id="niv-verse-24-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of silver for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-742'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-4" id="niv-verse-24-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped. </span></div>
