<h3>1 Kings 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'><b>(NIV)</b> When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.

<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
