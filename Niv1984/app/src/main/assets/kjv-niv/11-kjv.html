<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Now king David was old </span><i>and</i><span> stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>And the damsel </span><i>was</i><span> very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also </span><i>was a</i><span> very goodly </span><i>man</i><span>; and </span><i>his mother</i><span> bare him after Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which </span><i>belonged</i><span> to David, were not with Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which </span><i>is</i><span> by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth </span><i>it</i><span> not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest </span><i>it</i><span> not:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel </span><i>are</i><span> upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>But me, </span><i>even</i><span> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed </span><i>it</i><span> unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>And the king sware, and said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>Then Bathsheba bowed with </span><i>her</i><span> face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so </span><i>too</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>And Adonijah and all the guests that </span><i>were</i><span> with him heard </span><i>it</i><span> as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore </span><i>is this</i><span> noise of the city being in an uproar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou </span><i>art</i><span> a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This </span><i>is</i><span> the noise that ye have heard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[47] <span>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[48] <span>And also thus said the king, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the LORD God of Israel, which hath given </span><i>one</i><span> to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[49] <span>And all the guests that </span><i>were</i><span> with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[50] <span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[51] <span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[52] <span>And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[53] <span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-56'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[1] <span>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[2] <span>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[3] <span>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[4] <span>That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[5] <span>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, </span><i>and</i><span> what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that </span><i>was</i><span> about his loins, and in his shoes that </span><i>were</i><span> on his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[6] <span>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[7] <span>But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[8] <span>And, behold, </span><i>thou hast</i><span> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[9] <span>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou </span><i>art</i><span> a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[10] <span>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'>[11] <span>And the days that David reigned over Israel </span><i>were</i><span> forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'>[12] <span>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'>[13] <span>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[14] <span>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'>[15] <span>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and </span><i>that</i><span> all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[16] <span>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[17] <span>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'>[18] <span>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'>[19] <span>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'>[20] <span>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; </span><i>I pray thee</i><span>, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'>[21] <span>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-78'>[22] <span>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he </span><i>is</i><span> mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'>[23] <span>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-80'>[24] <span>Now therefore, </span><i>as</i><span> the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-81'>[25] <span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-82'>[26] <span>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou </span><i>art</i><span> worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-83'>[27] <span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-84'>[28] <span>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'>[29] <span>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, </span><i>he is</i><span> by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-86'>[30] <span>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'>[31] <span>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-88'>[32] <span>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing </span><i>thereof, to wit</i><span>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-89'>[33] <span>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-90'>[34] <span>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-91'>[35] <span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-92'>[36] <span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-93'>[37] <span>For it shall be, </span><i>that</i><span> on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-94'>[38] <span>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying </span><i>is</i><span> good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-95'>[39] <span>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants </span><i>be</i><span> in Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-96'>[40] <span>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-97'>[41] <span>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-98'>[42] <span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word </span><i>that</i><span> I have heard </span><i>is</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-99'>[43] <span>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-100'>[44] <span>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-101'>[45] <span>And king Solomon </span><i>shall be</i><span> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-102'>[46] <span>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-459'>[2] <span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-460'>[3] <span>That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-461'>[4] <span>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-462'>[5] <span>And he said unto them, Depart yet </span><i>for</i><span> three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-463'>[6] <span>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-464'>[7] <span>And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-465'>[8] <span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, </span><i>and</i><span> which stood before him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-466'>[9] <span>And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-467'>[10] <span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou </span><i>it</i><span> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little </span><i>finger</i><span> shall be thicker than my father's loins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-468'>[11] <span>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-469'>[12] <span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-470'>[13] <span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-471'>[14] <span>And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father </span><i>also</i><span> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-472'>[15] <span>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-473'>[16] <span>So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither </span><i>have we</i><span> inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-474'>[17] <span>But </span><i>as for</i><span> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-475'>[18] <span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who </span><i>was</i><span> over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-476'>[19] <span>So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-477'>[20] <span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-478'>[21] <span>And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-479'>[22] <span>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-480'>[23] <span>Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-481'>[24] <span>Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-482'>[25] <span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-483'>[26] <span>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-484'>[27] <span>If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-485'>[28] <span>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves </span><i>of</i><span> gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-486'>[29] <span>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-487'>[30] <span>And this thing became a sin: for the people went </span><i>to worship</i><span> before the one, </span><i>even</i><span> unto Dan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-488'>[31] <span>And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-489'>[32] <span>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that </span><i>is</i><span> in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-490'>[33] <span>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, </span><i>even</i><span> in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-495'>[3] <span>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This </span><i>is</i><span> the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that </span><i>are</i><span> upon it shall be poured out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-790'>[15] <span>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-791'>[16] <span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-792'>[17] <span>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-794'>[19] <span>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-795'>[20] <span>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found </span><i>thee</i><span>: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-796'>[21] <span>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-797'>[22] <span>And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked </span><i>me</i><span> to anger, and made Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-798'>[23] <span>And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-799'>[24] <span>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-800'>[25] <span>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-801'>[26] <span>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all </span><i>things</i><span> as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-802'>[27] <span>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-803'>[28] <span>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-804'>[29] <span>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: </span><i>but</i><span> in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-807'>[1] <span>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-808'>[2] <span>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-809'>[3] <span>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead </span><i>is</i><span> ours, and we </span><i>be</i><span> still, </span><i>and</i><span> take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-810'>[4] <span>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I </span><i>am</i><span> as thou </span><i>art</i><span>, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-811'>[5] <span>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-812'>[6] <span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver </span><i>it</i><span> into the hand of the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-813'>[7] <span>And Jehoshaphat said, </span><i>Is there</i><span> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-814'>[8] <span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, </span><i>There is</i><span> yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-815'>[9] <span>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten </span><i>hither</i><span> Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-816'>[10] <span>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-817'>[11] <span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-818'>[12] <span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver </span><i>it</i><span> into the king's hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-819'>[13] <span>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets </span><i>declare</i><span> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak </span><i>that which is</i><span> good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-820'>[14] <span>And Micaiah said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-821'>[15] <span>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear?

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-822'>[16] <span>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but </span><i>that which is</i><span> true in the name of the LORD?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-823'>[17] <span>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-824'>[18] <span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-825'>[19] <span>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-826'>[20] <span>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-827'>[21] <span>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-828'>[22] <span>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade </span><i>him</i><span>, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-829'>[23] <span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-830'>[24] <span>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-831'>[25] <span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-832'>[26] <span>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-833'>[27] <span>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this </span><i>fellow</i><span> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-834'>[28] <span>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-835'>[29] <span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-836'>[30] <span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-837'>[31] <span>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-839'>[33] <span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it </span><i>was</i><span> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-840'>[34] <span>And a </span><i>certain</i><span> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-841'>[35] <span>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-842'>[36] <span>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-843'>[37] <span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-849'>[43] <span>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; </span><i>for</i><span> the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'>[44] <span>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span></div>
