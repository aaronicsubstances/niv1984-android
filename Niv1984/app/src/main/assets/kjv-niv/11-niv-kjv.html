<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Of the nations </span><i>concerning</i><span> which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: </span><i>for</i><span> surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the detestable god of the Ammonites.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad </span><i>being</i><span> yet a little child.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!"</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And God stirred him up </span><i>another</i><span> adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">2</a>]</sup><span> [of Zobah]; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them </span><i>of Zobah</i><span>: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad </span><i>did</i><span>: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">3</a>]</sup><span> and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And this </span><i>was</i><span> the cause that he lifted up </span><i>his</i><span> hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, </span><i>and</i><span> repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</span></div>

<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Egypt.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Rehoboam answered, "Go away for three days and then come back to me." So the people went away.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, Depart yet </span><i>for</i><span> three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, </span><i>and</i><span> which stood before him:</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, `Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou </span><i>it</i><span> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little </span><i>finger</i><span> shall be thicker than my father's loins.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father </span><i>also</i><span> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So the Israelites went home.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither </span><i>have we</i><span> inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But </span><i>as for</i><span> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span></div>

King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who </span><i>was</i><span> over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>`This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-3" id="niv-verse-12-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver </span><i>it</i><span> into the king's hand.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, `I will entice him.'</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</span></div>
