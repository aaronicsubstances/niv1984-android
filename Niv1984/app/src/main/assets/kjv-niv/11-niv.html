<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>(His father had never interfered with him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and David's special guard did not join Adonijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Go in to King David and say to him, `My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: `Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, `Long live King Adonijah!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The king then took an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, "May my lord King David live forever!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, `Long live King Solomon!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>"Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, `May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>and said, `Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, `Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>Solomon replied, "If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go to your home."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-56'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: `If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me--what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: `I will not put you to death by the sword.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He had reigned forty years over Israel--seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will speak to the king for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him--after all, he is my older brother--yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And now, as surely as the LORD lives--he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised--Adonijah shall be put to death today!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, `Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported to the king, "This is how Joab answered me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then the king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them--Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army--were better men and more upright than he.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Shimei answered the king, "What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said." And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your slaves are in Gath."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, `On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, `What you say is good. I will obey.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him. The kingdom was now firmly established in Solomon's hands.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the king gave his ruling: "Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter--Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the detestable god of the Ammonites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-429'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-430'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return to my own country."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup><span> [of Zobah]; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-495'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>That same day the man of God gave a sign: "This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-497'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-498'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the king said to the man of God, "Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, "Oh, my brother!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-698'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD--he is God! The LORD--he is God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-702'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>"Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, `Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-704'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-705'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-708'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-709'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-710'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Elijah was afraid </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-711'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-713'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-714'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-715'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-716'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-717'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and mother good-by," he said, "and then I will come with you." "Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what Ben-Hadad says:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben-Hadad says: `I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The elders and the people all answered, "Don't listen to him or agree to his demands."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So he replied to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, `Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.'" They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The king of Israel answered, "Tell him: `One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-742'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and he ordered his men: "Prepare to attack." So they prepared to attack the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-743'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, "This is what the LORD says: `Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the LORD.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-744'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"But who will do this?" asked Ahab. The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says: `The young officers of the provincial commanders will do it.'" "And who will start the battle?" he asked. The prophet answered, "You will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-745'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So Ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders, 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-746'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The young officers of the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, "Men are advancing from Samaria."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-748'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-751'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-753'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-754'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Do this: Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-755'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>You must also raise an army like the one you lost--horse for horse and chariot for chariot--so we can fight Israel on the plains.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-756'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-757'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-758'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: `Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-759'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-760'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-761'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>His officials said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-762'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: `Please let me live.'" The king answered, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-763'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. "Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go and get him," the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-764'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"I will return the cities my father took from your father," Ben-Hadad offered. "You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." [Ahab said,] "On the basis of a treaty I will set you free." So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-765'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>By the word of the LORD one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, "Strike me with your weapon," but the man refused.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-766'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>So the prophet said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-767'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>The prophet found another man and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him and wounded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-768'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-769'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, `Guard this man.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-771'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-806'>Chapter 22</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-811'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--about four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-816'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-817'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what the LORD says: `With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-818'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-819'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-823'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, `These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-824'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, `I will entice him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>" `By what means?' the LORD asked. " `I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. " `You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. `Go and do it.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and say, `This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town; everyone to his land!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-2" id="niv-verse-22-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>In everything he walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>There was then no king in Edom; a deputy ruled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-3" id="niv-verse-22-3">c</a>]</sup><span> to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail--they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-855'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with your men," but Jehoshaphat refused.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-856'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-859'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done. </span></div>
