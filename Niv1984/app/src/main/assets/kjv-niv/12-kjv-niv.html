<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.

<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'><b>(NIV)</b> "If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!

<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'><b>(NIV)</b> The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'><b>(NIV)</b> He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?
