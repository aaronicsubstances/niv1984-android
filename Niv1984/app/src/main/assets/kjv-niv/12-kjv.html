<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that </span><i>was</i><span> in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, </span><i>Is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> not a God in Israel, </span><i>that</i><span> ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, </span><i>Is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> not a God in Israel, </span><i>that</i><span> thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And he said unto them, What manner of man </span><i>was he</i><span> which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And they answered him, </span><i>He was</i><span> an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It </span><i>is</i><span> Elijah the Tishbite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I </span><i>be</i><span> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I </span><i>be</i><span> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, </span><i>is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, </span><i>are</i><span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said </span><i>unto him, As</i><span> the LORD liveth, and </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>And the sons of the prophets that </span><i>were</i><span> at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know </span><i>it</i><span>; hold ye your peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, and </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>And the sons of the prophets that </span><i>were</i><span> at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know </span><i>it</i><span>; hold ye your peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, and </span><i>as</i><span> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped </span><i>it</i><span> together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: </span><i>nevertheless</i><span>, if thou see me </span><i>when I am</i><span> taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be </span><i>so</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, </span><i>there appeared</i><span> a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>And Elisha saw </span><i>it</i><span>, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where </span><i>is</i><span> the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>And when the sons of the prophets which </span><i>were</i><span> to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city </span><i>is</i><span> pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water </span><i>is</i><span> naught, and the ground barren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought </span><i>it</i><span> to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren </span><i>land</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[24] <span>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[25] <span>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-48'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[1] <span>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[2] <span>And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[3] <span>Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[4] <span>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[5] <span>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[6] <span>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[7] <span>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I </span><i>am</i><span> as thou </span><i>art</i><span>, my people as thy people, </span><i>and</i><span> my horses as thy horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[8] <span>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[9] <span>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[10] <span>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[11] <span>But Jehoshaphat said, </span><i>Is there</i><span> not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here </span><i>is</i><span> Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[12] <span>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[13] <span>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[14] <span>And Elisha said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[15] <span>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[17] <span>For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[18] <span>And this is </span><i>but</i><span> a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'>[19] <span>And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'>[20] <span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'>[21] <span>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[22] <span>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side </span><i>as</i><span> red as blood:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'>[23] <span>And they said, This </span><i>is</i><span> blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[24] <span>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in </span><i>their</i><span> country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[25] <span>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about </span><i>it</i><span>, and smote it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'>[26] <span>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through </span><i>even</i><span> unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'>[27] <span>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him </span><i>for</i><span> a burnt offering upon the wall.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'>[2] <span>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-125'>[2] <span>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-129'>[6] <span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have </span><i>therewith</i><span> sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'>[16] <span>But he said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take </span><i>it</i><span>; but he refused.</span></div>
