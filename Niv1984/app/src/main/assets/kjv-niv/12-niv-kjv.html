<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that </span><i>was</i><span> in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, </span><i>Is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> not a God in Israel, </span><i>that</i><span> ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore this is what the LORD says: `You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"'"</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, </span><i>Is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> not a God in Israel, </span><i>that</i><span> thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto them, What manner of man </span><i>was he</i><span> which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they answered him, </span><i>He was</i><span> an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It </span><i>is</i><span> Elijah the Tishbite.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, `Come down!'"</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I </span><i>be</i><span> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, `Come down at once!'"</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I </span><i>be</i><span> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, </span><i>is it</i><span> not because </span><i>there is</i><span> no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, </span><i>are</i><span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice </span><i>to do</i><span> to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.
