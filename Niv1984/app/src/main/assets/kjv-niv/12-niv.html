<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore this is what the LORD says: `You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, `Come down!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, `Come down at once!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He told the king, "This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," he replied, "but do not speak of it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours--otherwise not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not send them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says: `I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the water has remained wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-48'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Joram </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." "No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or even notice you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>and he said, "This is what the LORD says: Make this valley full of ditches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For this is what the LORD says: You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also hand Moab over to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was--water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red--like blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" "Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When all the jars were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another one." But he replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the oil stopped flowing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>She said to her husband, "I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite." So he called her, and she stood before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Elisha said to him, "Tell her, `You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"What can be done for her?" Elisha asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son and her husband is old."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"About this time next year," Elisha said, "you will hold a son in your arms." "No, my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead your servant, O man of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>She called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath." "It's all right," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the Shunammite!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Run to meet her and ask her, `Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?'" "Everything is all right," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she said. "Didn't I tell you, `Don't raise my hopes'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the child's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"By all means, go," the king of Aram replied. "I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of silver, six thousand shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of gold and ten sets of clothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: "With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message: "Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Naaman's servants went to him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, `Wash and be cleansed'!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your servant."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The prophet answered, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"If you will not," said Naaman, "please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I bow there also--when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Go in peace," Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. "Is everything all right?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"Everything is all right," Gehazi answered. "My master sent me to say, `Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-4" id="niv-verse-5-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of silver and two sets of clothing.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then he went in and stood before his master Elisha. "Where have you been, Gehazi?" Elisha asked. "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money, or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or menservants and maidservants?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and he was leprous, as white as snow.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?" "I will," Elisha replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh, my lord," he cried out, "it was borrowed!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: "Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, "Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"None of us, my lord the king," said one of his officers, "but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>After they entered the city, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the king of Assyria gave this order: "Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires."</span></div>
