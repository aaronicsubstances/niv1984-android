<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-698'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-699'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-709'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set </span><i>the battle</i><span> in array against them.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-710'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand </span><i>men which fought in</i><span> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-746'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And Ornan said unto David, Take </span><i>it</i><span> to thee, and let my lord the king do </span><i>that which is</i><span> good in his eyes: lo, I give </span><i>thee</i><span> the oxen </span><i>also</i><span> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span></div>
