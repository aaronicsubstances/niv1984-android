<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-433'>[7] <span>And when all the men of Israel that </span><i>were</i><span> in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-434'>[8] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'>[1] <span>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[2] <span>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, `You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[3] <span>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'>[4] <span>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[5] <span>said to David, "You will not get in here." Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[6] <span>David had said, "Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[7] <span>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[8] <span>He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[9] <span>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[10] <span>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men--they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[11] <span>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup><span> a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[12] <span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-455'>[13] <span>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'>[14] <span>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'>[15] <span>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[16] <span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[17] <span>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[18] <span>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[19] <span>"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[20] <span>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[21] <span>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'>[22] <span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'>[23] <span>And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-4" id="niv-verse-11-4">d</a>]</sup><span> tall.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-466'>[24] <span>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[25] <span>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'>[28] <span>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, with the sounding of rams' horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'>[1] <span>In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'>[2] <span>David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'>[3] <span>the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'>[4] <span>So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'>[5] <span>When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-698'>[6] <span>When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Aram Maacah and Zobah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'>[7] <span>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700'>[8] <span>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701'>[9] <span>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-702'>[10] <span>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703'>[11] <span>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-704'>[12] <span>Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-705'>[13] <span>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-706'>[14] <span>Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-707'>[15] <span>When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-708'>[16] <span>After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup><span> with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-709'>[17] <span>When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-710'>[18] <span>But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-711'>[19] <span>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-698'>[6] <span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-699'>[7] <span>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-700'>[8] <span>And when David heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-709'>[17] <span>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set </span><i>the battle</i><span> in array against them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'>[1] <span>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-725'>[2] <span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-726'>[3] <span>But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-727'>[4] <span>The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-728'>[5] <span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-729'>[6] <span>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-730'>[7] <span>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-731'>[8] <span>Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-732'>[9] <span>The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-733'>[10] <span>"Go and tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-734'>[11] <span>So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Take your choice:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'>[12] <span>three years of famine, three months of being swept away </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD--days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-736'>[13] <span>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'>[14] <span>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'>[15] <span>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'>[16] <span>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'>[17] <span>David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'>[18] <span>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-742'>[19] <span>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-743'>[20] <span>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-744'>[21] <span>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-745'>[22] <span>David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-746'>[23] <span>Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'>[24] <span>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-748'>[25] <span>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-3" id="niv-verse-21-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of gold for the site.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'>[26] <span>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-4" id="niv-verse-21-4">d</a>]</sup><span> He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'>[27] <span>Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-751'>[28] <span>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'>[29] <span>The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-725'>[2] <span>And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-726'>[3] <span>And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they </span><i>be</i><span>: but, my lord the king, </span><i>are</i><span> they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-727'>[4] <span>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-728'>[5] <span>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all </span><i>they of</i><span> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah </span><i>was</i><span> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-729'>[6] <span>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-730'>[7] <span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-731'>[8] <span>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-732'>[9] <span>And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-733'>[10] <span>Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three </span><i>things</i><span>: choose thee one of them, that I may do </span><i>it</i><span> unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-734'>[11] <span>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-735'>[12] <span>Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh </span><i>thee</i><span>; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-736'>[13] <span>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great </span><i>are</i><span> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-737'>[14] <span>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-738'>[15] <span>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-739'>[16] <span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders </span><i>of Israel, who were</i><span> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-740'>[17] <span>And David said unto God, </span><i>Is it</i><span> not I </span><i>that</i><span> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but </span><i>as for</i><span> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-741'>[18] <span>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-742'>[19] <span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-743'>[20] <span>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-744'>[21] <span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with </span><i>his</i><span> face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-745'>[22] <span>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of </span><i>this</i><span> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-746'>[23] <span>And Ornan said unto David, Take </span><i>it</i><span> to thee, and let my lord the king do </span><i>that which is</i><span> good in his eyes: lo, I give </span><i>thee</i><span> the oxen </span><i>also</i><span> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-747'>[24] <span>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take </span><i>that</i><span> which </span><i>is</i><span> thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-748'>[25] <span>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-749'>[26] <span>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-750'>[27] <span>And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-751'>[28] <span>At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-752'>[29] <span>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, </span><i>were</i><span> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-753'>[30] <span>But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-983'>[14] <span>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-984'>[15] <span>We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-985'>[16] <span>O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-986'>[17] <span>I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-970'>[1] <span>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, </span><i>is yet</i><span> young and tender, and the work </span><i>is</i><span> great: for the palace </span><i>is</i><span> not for man, but for the LORD God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-971'>[2] <span>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for </span><i>things to be made</i><span> of gold, and the silver for </span><i>things</i><span> of silver, and the brass for </span><i>things</i><span> of brass, the iron for </span><i>things</i><span> of iron, and wood for </span><i>things</i><span> of wood; onyx stones, and </span><i>stones</i><span> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-972'>[3] <span>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, </span><i>which</i><span> I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-973'>[4] <i>Even</i><span> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses </span><i>withal</i><span>:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-975'>[6] <span>Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-976'>[7] <span>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-977'>[8] <span>And they with whom </span><i>precious</i><span> stones were found gave </span><i>them</i><span> to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-978'>[9] <span>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-979'>[10] <span>Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-981'>[12] <span>Both riches and honour </span><i>come</i><span> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand </span><i>is</i><span> power and might; and in thine hand </span><i>it is</i><span> to make great, and to give strength unto all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-982'>[13] <span>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-984'>[15] <span>For we </span><i>are</i><span> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as </span><i>were</i><span> all our fathers: our days on the earth </span><i>are</i><span> as a shadow, and </span><i>there is</i><span> none abiding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-985'>[16] <span>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name </span><i>cometh</i><span> of thine hand, and </span><i>is</i><span> all thine own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-986'>[17] <span>I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-987'>[18] <span>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-988'>[19] <span>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all </span><i>these things</i><span>, and to build the palace, </span><i>for</i><span> the which I have made provision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-989'>[20] <span>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-990'>[21] <span>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, </span><i>even</i><span> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, </span><i>and</i><span> a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-991'>[22] <span>And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed </span><i>him</i><span> unto the LORD </span><i>to be</i><span> the chief governor, and Zadok </span><i>to be</i><span> priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-992'>[23] <span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-993'>[24] <span>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-994'>[25] <span>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him </span><i>such</i><span> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-995'>[26] <span>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-996'>[27] <span>And the time that he reigned over Israel </span><i>was</i><span> forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three </span><i>years</i><span> reigned he in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-997'>[28] <span>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-998'>[29] <span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</span></div>
