<div id='verse-364'>[1] <span>All Israel was listed in the genealogies recorded in the book of the kings of Israel. The people of Judah were taken captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[2] <span>Now the first to resettle on their own property in their own towns were some Israelites, priests, Levites and temple servants.</span></div>

<div id='verse-366'>[3] <span>Those from Judah, from Benjamin, and from Ephraim and Manasseh who lived in Jerusalem were:</span></div>

<div id='verse-372'>[9] <span>The people from Benjamin, as listed in their genealogy, numbered 956. All these men were heads of their families.</span></div>

<div id='verse-374'>[11] <span>Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the official in charge of the house of God;</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[13] <span>The priests, who were heads of families, numbered 1,760. They were able men, responsible for ministering in the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-377'>[14] <span>Of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, a Merarite;</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[15] <span>Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal and Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zicri, the son of Asaph;</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[16] <span>Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berekiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-380'>[17] <span>The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman and their brothers, Shallum their chief</span></div>

<div id='verse-381'>[18] <span>being stationed at the King's Gate on the east, up to the present time. These were the gatekeepers belonging to the camp of the Levites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-382'>[19] <span>Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his fellow gatekeepers from his family (the Korahites) were responsible for guarding the thresholds of the Tent </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> just as their fathers had been responsible for guarding the entrance to the dwelling of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-383'>[20] <span>In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar was in charge of the gatekeepers, and the LORD was with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-384'>[21] <span>Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[22] <span>Altogether, those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. The gatekeepers had been assigned to their positions of trust by David and Samuel the seer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-386'>[23] <span>They and their descendants were in charge of guarding the gates of the house of the LORD--the house called the Tent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[24] <span>The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north and south.</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[25] <span>Their brothers in their villages had to come from time to time and share their duties for seven-day periods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[26] <span>But the four principal gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[27] <span>They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning.</span></div>

<div id='verse-391'>[28] <span>Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service; they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[29] <span>Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the flour and wine, and the oil, incense and spices.</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[30] <span>But some of the priests took care of mixing the spices.</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[31] <span>A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with the responsibility for baking the offering bread.</span></div>

<div id='verse-395'>[32] <span>Some of their Kohathite brothers were in charge of preparing for every Sabbath the bread set out on the table.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[33] <span>Those who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms of the temple and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible for the work day and night.</span></div>

<div id='verse-397'>[34] <span>All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs as listed in their genealogy, and they lived in Jerusalem. </span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[35] <span>Jeiel the father </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of Gibeon lived in Gibeon. His wife's name was Maacah,</span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[37] <span>Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah and Mikloth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-401'>[38] <span>Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They too lived near their relatives in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-408'>[1] <span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.</span></div>

<div id='verse-409'>[2] <span>The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.</span></div>

<div id='verse-410'>[3] <span>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-411'>[4] <span>Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-412'>[5] <span>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-413'>[6] <span>So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.</span></div>

<div id='verse-414'>[7] <span>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-415'>[8] <span>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</span></div>

<div id='verse-416'>[9] <span>They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-417'>[10] <span>They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-418'>[11] <span>When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul,</span></div>

<div id='verse-419'>[12] <span>all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-420'>[13] <span>Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,</span></div>

<div id='verse-421'>[14] <span>and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-422'>[1] <span>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-423'>[2] <span>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, `You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[3] <span>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-425'>[4] <span>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there</span></div>

<div id='verse-426'>[5] <span>said to David, "You will not get in here." Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.</span></div>

<div id='verse-427'>[6] <span>David had said, "Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[7] <span>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[8] <span>He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[9] <span>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[10] <span>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men--they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised--</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[11] <span>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup><span> a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-433'>[12] <span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-434'>[13] <span>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.</span></div>

<div id='verse-435'>[14] <span>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.</span></div>

<div id='verse-436'>[15] <span>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[16] <span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[17] <span>David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-439'>[18] <span>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-440'>[19] <span>"God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[20] <span>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.</span></div>

<div id='verse-442'>[21] <span>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-443'>[22] <span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-444'>[23] <span>And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-4" id="niv-verse-11-4">d</a>]</sup><span> tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-445'>[24] <span>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-446'>[25] <span>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. </span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[26] <span>The mighty men were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[27] <span>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[28] <span>Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, Abiezer from Anathoth,</span></div>

<div id='verse-470'>[2] <span>they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin): </span></div>

<div id='verse-471'>[3] <span>Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,</span></div>

<div id='verse-476'>[8] <span>Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.</span></div>

<div id='verse-477'>[9] <span>Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,</span></div>

<div id='verse-481'>[13] <span>Jeremiah the tenth and Macbannai the eleventh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-482'>[14] <span>These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-483'>[15] <span>It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.</span></div>

<div id='verse-484'>[16] <span>Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-485'>[17] <span>David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in peace, to help me, I am ready to have you unite with me.

<div id='verse-486'>[18] <span>Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: "We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse!

<div id='verse-487'>[19] <span>Some of the men of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul.

<div id='verse-488'>[20] <span>When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-550'>[11] <span>Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-552'>[13] <span>It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way."</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-656'>[1] <span>In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-657'>[2] <span>David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-658'>[3] <span>the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-659'>[4] <span>So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-660'>[5] <span>When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</span></div>

<div id='verse-661'>[6] <span>When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Aram Maacah and Zobah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-662'>[7] <span>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-663'>[8] <span>On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-664'>[9] <span>The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.</span></div>

<div id='verse-665'>[10] <span>Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.</span></div>

<div id='verse-666'>[11] <span>He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-667'>[12] <span>Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-668'>[13] <span>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."</span></div>

<div id='verse-669'>[14] <span>Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-670'>[15] <span>When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-671'>[16] <span>After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup><span> with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-672'>[17] <span>When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-673'>[18] <span>But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.</span></div>

<div id='verse-674'>[19] <span>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.</span></div>

<div id='verse-675'>[1] <span>In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-676'>[2] <span>David took the crown from the head of their king </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> --its weight was found to be a talent </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-2" id="niv-verse-20-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of gold, and it was set with precious stones--and it was placed on David's head.

<div id='verse-677'>[3] <span>and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-678'>[4] <span>In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-683'>[1] <span>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-684'>[2] <span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."</span></div>

<div id='verse-685'>[3] <span>But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-686'>[4] <span>The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-687'>[5] <span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-688'>[6] <span>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-689'>[7] <span>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-690'>[8] <span>Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."</span></div>

<div id='verse-691'>[9] <span>The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,</span></div>

<div id='verse-692'>[10] <span>"Go and tell David, `This is what the LORD says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-693'>[11] <span>So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: `Take your choice:</span></div>

<div id='verse-694'>[12] <span>three years of famine, three months of being swept away </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD--days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-695'>[13] <span>David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."</span></div>

<div id='verse-696'>[14] <span>So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-697'>[15] <span>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the Jebusite.</span></div>

<div id='verse-698'>[16] <span>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</span></div>

<div id='verse-699'>[17] <span>David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."</span></div>

<div id='verse-700'>[18] <span>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>

<div id='verse-701'>[19] <span>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-702'>[20] <span>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-703'>[21] <span>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</span></div>

<div id='verse-704'>[22] <span>David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."</span></div>

<div id='verse-705'>[23] <span>Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."</span></div>

<div id='verse-706'>[24] <span>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</span></div>

<div id='verse-707'>[25] <span>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-3" id="niv-verse-21-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of gold for the site.</span></div>

<div id='verse-708'>[26] <span>David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-4" id="niv-verse-21-4">d</a>]</sup><span> He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.</span></div>

<div id='verse-709'>[27] <span>Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-710'>[28] <span>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-711'>[29] <span>The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-737'>[6] <span>David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. </span></div>

<div id='verse-738'>[7] <span>Belonging to the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</span></div>

<div id='verse-739'>[8] <span>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel--three in all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-740'>[9] <span>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran--three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-741'>[10] <span>And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei--four in all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-742'>[11] <span>Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment. </span></div>

<div id='verse-743'>[12] <span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel--four in all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-744'>[13] <span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-745'>[14] <span>The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.</span></div>

<div id='verse-746'>[15] <span>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-747'>[16] <span>The descendants of Gershom: Shubael was the first.</span></div>

<div id='verse-748'>[17] <span>The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-749'>[18] <span>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.</span></div>

<div id='verse-750'>[19] <span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-751'>[20] <span>The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first and Isshiah the second. </span></div>

<div id='verse-752'>[21] <span>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-753'>[22] <span>Eleazar died without having sons: he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-754'>[23] <span>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth--three in all. </span></div>

<div id='verse-755'>[24] <span>These were the descendants of Levi by their families--the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-756'>[25] <span>For David had said, "Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,</span></div>

<div id='verse-757'>[26] <span>the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service."</span></div>

<div id='verse-758'>[27] <span>According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-759'>[28] <span>The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD: to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-760'>[29] <span>They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.</span></div>

<div id='verse-761'>[30] <span>They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening</span></div>

<div id='verse-762'>[31] <span>and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-763'>[32] <span>And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-892'>[1] <span>David summoned all the officials of Israel to assemble at Jerusalem: the officers over the tribes, the commanders of the divisions in the service of the king, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the mighty men and all the brave warriors.</span></div>

<div id='verse-893'>[2] <span>King David rose to his feet and said: "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-894'>[3] <span>But God said to me, `You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-895'>[4] <span>"Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah he chose my family, and from my father's sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-896'>[5] <span>Of all my sons--and the LORD has given me many--he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-897'>[6] <span>He said to me: `Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-898'>[7] <span>I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-899'>[8] <span>"So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-900'>[9] <span>"And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-901'>[10] <span>Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary. Be strong and do the work."</span></div>

<div id='verse-902'>[11] <span>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement.</span></div>

<div id='verse-903'>[12] <span>He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the LORD and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-904'>[13] <span>He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the LORD, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.</span></div>

<div id='verse-905'>[14] <span>He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service:</span></div>

<div id='verse-906'>[15] <span>the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;</span></div>

<div id='verse-907'>[16] <span>the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables;</span></div>

<div id='verse-908'>[17] <span>the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish;</span></div>

<div id='verse-909'>[18] <span>and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and shelter the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-910'>[19] <span>"All this," David said, "I have in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."</span></div>

<div id='verse-911'>[20] <span>David also said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the LORD is finished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-912'>[21] <span>The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing man skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 29</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-913'>[1] <span>Then King David said to the whole assembly: "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-914'>[2] <span>With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God--gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-1" id="niv-verse-29-1">a</a>]</sup><span> stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble--all of these in large quantities.</span></div>

<div id='verse-915'>[3] <span>Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple:</span></div>

<div id='verse-916'>[4] <span>three thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-2" id="niv-verse-29-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-3" id="niv-verse-29-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings,</span></div>

<div id='verse-917'>[5] <span>for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-918'>[6] <span>Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-919'>[7] <span>They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-4" id="niv-verse-29-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and ten thousand darics </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-5" id="niv-verse-29-5">e</a>]</sup><span> of gold, ten thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-6" id="niv-verse-29-6">f</a>]</sup><span> of silver, eighteen thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-7" id="niv-verse-29-7">g</a>]</sup><span> of bronze and a hundred thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-29-8" id="niv-verse-29-8">h</a>]</sup><span> of iron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-920'>[8] <span>Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.</span></div>

<div id='verse-921'>[9] <span>The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly. </span></div>

<div id='verse-922'>[10] <span>David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.</span></div>

<div id='verse-923'>[11] <span>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-924'>[12] <span>Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-925'>[13] <span>Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-926'>[14] <span>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-927'>[15] <span>We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.</span></div>

<div id='verse-928'>[16] <span>O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-929'>[17] <span>I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-930'>[18] <span>O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-931'>[19] <span>And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."</span></div>

<div id='verse-932'>[20] <span>Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So they all praised the LORD, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the LORD and the king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-933'>[21] <span>The next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and presented burnt offerings to him: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-934'>[22] <span>They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-935'>[23] <span>So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-936'>[24] <span>All the officers and mighty men, as well as all of King David's sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-937'>[25] <span>The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.</span></div>

<div id='verse-938'>[26] <span>David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-939'>[27] <span>He ruled over Israel forty years--seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-940'>[28] <span>He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-941'>[29] <span>As for the events of King David's reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,</span></div>
