<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-741'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."</span></div>
