<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God </span><i>was</i><span> with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that </span><i>was</i><span> at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to </span><i>the place which</i><span> David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which </span><i>was</i><span> at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, </span><i>that is so</i><span> great?</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>Wisdom and knowledge </span><i>is</i><span> granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that </span><i>have been</i><span> before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>Then Solomon came </span><i>from his journey</i><span> to the high place that </span><i>was</i><span> at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem </span><i>as plenteous</i><span> as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that </span><i>are</i><span> in the vale for abundance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred </span><i>shekels</i><span> of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out </span><i>horses</i><span> for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-18'>[1] <span>And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[2] <span>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[3] <span>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, </span><i>even so deal with me</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[4] <span>Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate </span><i>it</i><span> to him, </span><i>and</i><span> to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This </span><i>is an ordinance</i><span> for ever to Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[5] <span>And the house which I build </span><i>is</i><span> great: for great </span><i>is</i><span> our God above all gods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[6] <span>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who </span><i>am</i><span> I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[7] <span>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that </span><i>are</i><span> with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[8] <span>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants </span><i>shall be</i><span> with thy servants,</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[9] <span>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build </span><i>shall be</i><span> wonderful great.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[10] <span>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[11] <span>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[12] <span>Huram said moreover, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[13] <span>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[14] <span>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father </span><i>was</i><span> a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[15] <span>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[16] <span>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[17] <span>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that </span><i>were</i><span> in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[18] <span>And he set threescore and ten thousand of them </span><i>to be</i><span> bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand </span><i>to be</i><span> hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-36'>[1] <span>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where </span><i>the LORD</i><span> appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[2] <span>And he began to build in the second </span><i>day</i><span> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[3] <span>Now these </span><i>are the things wherein</i><span> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure </span><i>was</i><span> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[4] <span>And the porch that </span><i>was</i><span> in the front </span><i>of the house</i><span>, the length </span><i>of it was</i><span> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height </span><i>was</i><span> an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[5] <span>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[6] <span>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold </span><i>was</i><span> gold of Parvaim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[7] <span>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[8] <span>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof </span><i>was</i><span> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, </span><i>amounting</i><span> to six hundred talents.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[9] <span>And the weight of the nails </span><i>was</i><span> fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[10] <span>And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[11] <span>And the wings of the cherubims </span><i>were</i><span> twenty cubits long: one wing </span><i>of the one cherub was</i><span> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing </span><i>was likewise</i><span> five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[12] <span>And </span><i>one</i><span> wing of the other cherub </span><i>was</i><span> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing </span><i>was</i><span> five cubits </span><i>also</i><span>, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[13] <span>The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces </span><i>were</i><span> inward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[14] <span>And he made the vail </span><i>of</i><span> blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[15] <span>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that </span><i>was</i><span> on the top of each of them </span><i>was</i><span> five cubits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[16] <span>And he made chains, </span><i>as</i><span> in the oracle, and put </span><i>them</i><span> on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put </span><i>them</i><span> on the chains.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[17] <span>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[2] <span>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[3] <span>And under it </span><i>was</i><span> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen </span><i>were</i><span> cast, when it was cast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[4] <span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea </span><i>was set</i><span> above upon them, and all their hinder parts </span><i>were</i><span> inward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[5] <span>And the thickness of it </span><i>was</i><span> an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; </span><i>and</i><span> it received and held three thousand baths.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[6] <span>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea </span><i>was</i><span> for the priests to wash in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[7] <span>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set </span><i>them</i><span> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[8] <span>He made also ten tables, and placed </span><i>them</i><span> in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[9] <span>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[10] <span>And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[11] <span>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[13] <span>And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which </span><i>were</i><span> upon the pillars.</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[14] <span>He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[15] <span>One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[16] <span>The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[17] <span>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[18] <span>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[19] <span>And Solomon made all the vessels that </span><i>were for</i><span> the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread </span><i>was set</i><span>;</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[2] <span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which </span><i>is</i><span> Zion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[3] <span>Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which </span><i>was</i><span> in the seventh month.</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[4] <span>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[5] <span>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that </span><i>were</i><span> in the tabernacle, these did the priests </span><i>and</i><span> the Levites bring up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[6] <span>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[7] <span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy </span><i>place, even</i><span> under the wings of the cherubims:</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[8] <span>For the cherubims spread forth </span><i>their</i><span> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[13] <span>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers </span><i>were</i><span> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up </span><i>their</i><span> voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, </span><i>saying</i><span>, For </span><i>he is</i><span> good; for his mercy </span><i>endureth</i><span> for ever: that </span><i>then</i><span> the house was filled with a cloud, </span><i>even</i><span> the house of the LORD;</span></div>

<div id='verse-131'>[1] <span>Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[2] <span>And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-133'>[3] <span>And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, </span><i>saying</i><span>, For </span><i>he is</i><span> good; for his mercy </span><i>endureth</i><span> for ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-134'>[4] <span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[5] <span>And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[6] <span>And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy </span><i>endureth</i><span> for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[7] <span>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that </span><i>was</i><span> before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-138'>[8] <span>Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-139'>[9] <span>And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[10] <span>And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[11] <span>Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</span></div>

<div id='verse-142'>[12] <span>And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[9] <span>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they </span><i>were</i><span> men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[10] <span>And these </span><i>were</i><span> the chief of king Solomon's officers, </span><i>even</i><span> two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[11] <span>And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because </span><i>the places are</i><span> holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[12] <span>Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[13] <span>Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, </span><i>even</i><span> in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[14] <span>And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[2] <span>And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-244'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-245'>[2] <span>And it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</span></div>

<div id='verse-246'>[3] <span>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people </span><i>were</i><span> without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</span></div>

<div id='verse-247'>[4] <span>And he took the fenced cities which </span><i>pertained</i><span> to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-248'>[5] <span>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and </span><i>to</i><span> the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-249'>[6] <span>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD </span><i>is</i><span> righteous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-250'>[7] <span>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; </span><i>therefore</i><span> I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-251'>[8] <span>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</span></div>

<div id='verse-252'>[9] <span>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span></div>

<div id='verse-253'>[10] <span>Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed </span><i>them</i><span> to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-254'>[11] <span>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[12] <span>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy </span><i>him</i><span> altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</span></div>

<div id='verse-256'>[13] <span>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam </span><i>was</i><span> one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.

<div id='verse-257'>[14] <span>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-260'>[1] <span>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-261'>[2] <span>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also </span><i>was</i><span> Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[3] <span>And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, </span><i>even</i><span> four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, </span><i>being</i><span> mighty men of valour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-263'>[4] <span>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which </span><i>is</i><span> in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</span></div>

<div id='verse-264'>[5] <span>Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, </span><i>even</i><span> to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span></div>

<div id='verse-265'>[6] <span>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-266'>[7] <span>And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-267'>[8] <span>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye </span><i>be</i><span> a great multitude, and </span><i>there are</i><span> with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-268'>[9] <span>Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of </span><i>other</i><span> lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, </span><i>the same</i><span> may be a priest of </span><i>them that are</i><span> no gods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-269'>[10] <span>But as for us, the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, </span><i>are</i><span> the sons of Aaron, and the Levites </span><i>wait</i><span> upon </span><i>their</i><span> business:</span></div>

<div id='verse-270'>[11] <span>And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also </span><i>set they in order</i><span> upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[12] <span>And, behold, God himself </span><i>is</i><span> with us for </span><i>our</i><span> captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you.

<div id='verse-272'>[13] <span>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment </span><i>was</i><span> behind them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[14] <span>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle </span><i>was</i><span> before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-274'>[15] <span>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-275'>[16] <span>And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[17] <span>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-277'>[18] <span>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-278'>[19] <span>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[2] <span>And Asa did </span><i>that which was</i><span> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[3] <span>For he took away the altars of the strange </span><i>gods</i><span>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[4] <span>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[5] <span>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[6] <span>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[7] <span>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about </span><i>them</i><span> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, </span><i>while</i><span> the land </span><i>is</i><span> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought </span><i>him</i><span>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[8] <span>And Asa had an army </span><i>of men</i><span> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these </span><i>were</i><span> mighty men of valour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[9] <span>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[10] <span>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[11] <span>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, </span><i>it is</i><span> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou </span><i>art</i><span> our God; let not man prevail against thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[12] <span>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[13] <span>And Asa and the people that </span><i>were</i><span> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[14] <span>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[3] <span>Now for a long season Israel </span><i>hath been</i><span> without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-311'>[15] <span>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</span></div>

<div id='verse-317'>[2] <span>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-319'>[4] <span>And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</span></div>

<div id='verse-322'>[7] <span>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-323'>[8] <span>Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-356'>[8] <span>And the king of Israel called for one </span><i>of his</i><span> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</span></div>

<div id='verse-357'>[9] <span>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in </span><i>their</i><span> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-358'>[10] <span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-359'>[11] <span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver </span><i>it</i><span> into the hand of the king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-360'>[12] <span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets </span><i>declare</i><span> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</span></div>

<div id='verse-361'>[13] <span>And Micaiah said, </span><i>As</i><span> the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-362'>[14] <span>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-363'>[15] <span>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</span></div>

<div id='verse-364'>[16] <span>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return </span><i>therefore</i><span> every man to his house in peace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[17] <span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee </span><i>that</i><span> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</span></div>

<div id='verse-366'>[18] <span>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and </span><i>on</i><span> his left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-367'>[19] <span>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</span></div>

<div id='verse-368'>[20] <span>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</span></div>

<div id='verse-369'>[21] <span>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And </span><i>the LORD</i><span> said, Thou shalt entice </span><i>him</i><span>, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do </span><i>even</i><span> so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-370'>[22] <span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-371'>[23] <span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-372'>[24] <span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-373'>[25] <span>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span></div>

<div id='verse-374'>[26] <span>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this </span><i>fellow</i><span> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-375'>[27] <span>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, </span><i>then</i><span> hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[28] <span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-377'>[29] <span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[30] <span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that </span><i>were</i><span> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[31] <span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It </span><i>is</i><span> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them </span><i>to depart</i><span> from him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-380'>[32] <span>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-381'>[33] <span>And a </span><i>certain</i><span> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span></div>

<div id='verse-382'>[34] <span>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed </span><i>himself</i><span> up in </span><i>his</i><span> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[3] <span>Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[5] <span>And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</span></div>

<div id='verse-395'>[2] <span>Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they </span><i>be</i><span> in Hazazontamar, which </span><i>is</i><span> Engedi.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[3] <span>And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[5] <span>And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,</span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[7] <i>Art</i><span> not thou our God, </span><i>who</i><span> didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?</span></div>

<div id='verse-403'>[10] <span>And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;</span></div>

<div id='verse-404'>[11] <span>Behold, </span><i>I say, how</i><span> they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-406'>[13] <span>And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-407'>[14] <span>Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;</span></div>

<div id='verse-408'>[15] <span>And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle </span><i>is</i><span> not yours, but God's.</span></div>

<div id='verse-409'>[16] <span>To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-411'>[18] <span>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with </span><i>his</i><span> face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-412'>[19] <span>And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</span></div>

<div id='verse-413'>[20] <span>And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</span></div>

<div id='verse-414'>[21] <span>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy </span><i>endureth</i><span> for ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-415'>[22] <span>And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</span></div>

<div id='verse-416'>[23] <span>For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy </span><i>them</i><span>: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</span></div>

<div id='verse-417'>[24] <span>And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they </span><i>were</i><span> dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</span></div>

<div id='verse-418'>[25] <span>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</span></div>

<div id='verse-419'>[26] <span>And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-420'>[27] <span>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-421'>[28] <span>And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-422'>[29] <span>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of </span><i>those</i><span> countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-423'>[30] <span>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[31] <span>And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: </span><i>he was</i><span> thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name </span><i>was</i><span> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span></div>

<div id='verse-425'>[32] <span>And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in the sight of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-426'>[33] <span>Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-427'>[34] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who </span><i>is</i><span> mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[35] <span>And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[36] <span>And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber.</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[37] <span>Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[1] <span>Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[2] <span>And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these </span><i>were</i><span> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-433'>[3] <span>And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he </span><i>was</i><span> the firstborn.</span></div>

<div id='verse-434'>[4] <span>Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and </span><i>divers</i><span> also of the princes of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-435'>[5] <span>Jehoram </span><i>was</i><span> thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-436'>[6] <span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the eyes of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[7] <span>Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[8] <span>In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-440'>[10] <span>So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time </span><i>also</i><span> did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[11] <span>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah </span><i>thereto</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-442'>[12] <span>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span></div>

<div id='verse-443'>[13] <span>But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, </span><i>which were</i><span> better than thyself:</span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[17] <span>And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[18] <span>And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[19] <span>And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-457'>[7] <span>And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span></div>

<div id='verse-470'>[8] <span>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go </span><i>out</i><span> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-471'>[9] <span>Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that </span><i>had been</i><span> king David's, which </span><i>were</i><span> in the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-472'>[10] <span>And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</span></div>

<div id='verse-473'>[11] <span>Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and </span><i>gave him</i><span> the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-474'>[12] <span>Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</span></div>

<div id='verse-475'>[13] <span>And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</span></div>

<div id='verse-476'>[14] <span>Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-477'>[15] <span>So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-478'>[16] <span>And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-479'>[17] <span>Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span></div>

<div id='verse-480'>[18] <span>Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, </span><i>as it was ordained</i><span> by David.</span></div>

<div id='verse-481'>[19] <span>And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none </span><i>which was</i><span> unclean in any thing should enter in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-482'>[20] <span>And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-483'>[21] <span>And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</span></div>

<div id='verse-485'>[2] <span>And Joash did </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-486'>[3] <span>And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-488'>[5] <span>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened </span><i>it</i><span> not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-489'>[6] <span>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, </span><i>according to the commandment</i><span> of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</span></div>

<div id='verse-490'>[7] <span>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-491'>[8] <span>And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-492'>[9] <span>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection </span><i>that</i><span> Moses the servant of God </span><i>laid</i><span> upon Israel in the wilderness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-493'>[10] <span>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-494'>[11] <span>Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that </span><i>there was</i><span> much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-495'>[12] <span>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-496'>[13] <span>So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-497'>[14] <span>And when they had finished </span><i>it</i><span>, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, </span><i>even</i><span> vessels to minister, and to offer </span><i>withal</i><span>, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</span></div>

<div id='verse-498'>[15] <span>But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old </span><i>was he</i><span> when he died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-499'>[16] <span>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-500'>[17] <span>Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-501'>[18] <span>And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-503'>[20] <span>And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-504'>[21] <span>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-505'>[22] <span>Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon </span><i>it</i><span>, and require </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-506'>[23] <span>And it came to pass at the end of the year, </span><i>that</i><span> the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-507'>[24] <span>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</span></div>

<div id='verse-508'>[25] <span>And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-509'>[26] <span>And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</span></div>

<div id='verse-511'>[1] <span>Amaziah </span><i>was</i><span> twenty and five years old </span><i>when</i><span> he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name </span><i>was</i><span> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-513'>[3] <span>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-514'>[4] <span>But he slew not their children, but </span><i>did</i><span> as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-515'>[5] <span>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of </span><i>their</i><span> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice </span><i>men, able</i><span> to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</span></div>

<div id='verse-516'>[6] <span>He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</span></div>

<div id='verse-517'>[7] <span>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> not with Israel, </span><i>to wit, with</i><span> all the children of Ephraim.</span></div>

<div id='verse-518'>[8] <span>But if thou wilt go, do </span><i>it</i><span>, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</span></div>

<div id='verse-519'>[9] <span>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</span></div>

<div id='verse-520'>[10] <span>Then Amaziah separated them, </span><i>to wit</i><span>, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-521'>[11] <span>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-522'>[12] <span>And </span><i>other</i><span> ten thousand </span><i>left</i><span> alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</span></div>

<div id='verse-523'>[13] <span>But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-525'>[15] <span>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-526'>[16] <span>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that </span><i>the king</i><span> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?

<div id='verse-527'>[17] <span>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</span></div>

<div id='verse-528'>[18] <span>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that </span><i>was</i><span> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that </span><i>was</i><span> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that </span><i>was</i><span> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-529'>[19] <span>Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to </span><i>thine</i><span> hurt, that thou shouldest fall, </span><i>even</i><span> thou, and Judah with thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-530'>[20] <span>But Amaziah would not hear; for it </span><i>came</i><span> of God, that he might deliver them into the hand </span><i>of their enemies</i><span>, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-531'>[21] <span>So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, </span><i>both</i><span> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which </span><i>belongeth</i><span> to Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-532'>[22] <span>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-533'>[23] <span>And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-534'>[24] <span>And </span><i>he took</i><span> all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<div id='verse-535'>[25] <span>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-536'>[26] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, </span><i>are</i><span> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span></div>

<div id='verse-537'>[27] <span>Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-544'>[6] <span>And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</span></div>

<div id='verse-549'>[11] <span>Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, </span><i>one</i><span> of the king's captains.</span></div>

<div id='verse-554'>[16] <span>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to </span><i>his</i><span> destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</span></div>

<div id='verse-581'>[11] <span>Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> upon you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-582'>[12] <span>Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</span></div>

<div id='verse-583'>[13] <span>And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD </span><i>already</i><span>, ye intend to add </span><i>more</i><span> to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and </span><i>there is</i><span> fierce wrath against Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-584'>[14] <span>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-585'>[15] <span>And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</span></div>

<div id='verse-586'>[16] <span>At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-587'>[17] <span>For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</span></div>

<div id='verse-588'>[18] <span>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-589'>[19] <span>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-590'>[20] <span>And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-591'>[21] <span>For Ahaz took away a portion </span><i>out</i><span> of the house of the LORD, and </span><i>out</i><span> of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-592'>[22] <span>And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this </span><i>is that</i><span> king Ahaz.</span></div>

<div id='verse-593'>[23] <span>For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, </span><i>therefore</i><span> will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-594'>[24] <span>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-595'>[25] <span>And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[26] <span>Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-597'>[27] <span>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, </span><i>even</i><span> in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-598'>[1] <span>Hezekiah began to reign </span><i>when he was</i><span> five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name </span><i>was</i><span> Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-599'>[2] <span>And he did </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-600'>[3] <span>He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-601'>[4] <span>And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,</span></div>

<div id='verse-602'>[5] <span>And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy </span><i>place</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-603'>[6] <span>For our fathers have trespassed, and done </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned </span><i>their</i><span> backs.</span></div>

<div id='verse-604'>[7] <span>Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy </span><i>place</i><span> unto the God of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-605'>[8] <span>Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-606'>[9] <span>For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives </span><i>are</i><span> in captivity for this.</span></div>

<div id='verse-607'>[10] <span>Now </span><i>it is</i><span> in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-608'>[11] <span>My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</span></div>

<div id='verse-609'>[12] <span>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</span></div>

<div id='verse-610'>[13] <span>And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:</span></div>

<div id='verse-612'>[15] <span>And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-613'>[16] <span>And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse </span><i>it</i><span>, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD.

<div id='verse-614'>[17] <span>Now they began on the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-615'>[18] <span>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-616'>[19] <span>Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> before the altar of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-617'>[20] <span>Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-618'>[21] <span>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah.

<div id='verse-619'>[22] <span>So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled </span><i>it</i><span> on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-620'>[23] <span>And they brought forth the he goats </span><i>for</i><span> the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-621'>[24] <span>And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded </span><i>that</i><span> the burnt offering and the sin offering </span><i>should be made</i><span> for all Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-622'>[25] <span>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for </span><i>so was</i><span> the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-623'>[26] <span>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-624'>[27] <span>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began </span><i>also</i><span> with the trumpets, and with the instruments </span><i>ordained</i><span> by David king of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-625'>[28] <span>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: </span><i>and</i><span> all </span><i>this continued</i><span> until the burnt offering was finished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-626'>[29] <span>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</span></div>

<div id='verse-627'>[30] <span>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span></div>

<div id='verse-628'>[31] <span>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-629'>[32] <span>And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, </span><i>and</i><span> two hundred lambs: all these </span><i>were</i><span> for a burnt offering to the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-630'>[33] <span>And the consecrated things </span><i>were</i><span> six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</span></div>

<div id='verse-631'>[34] <span>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the </span><i>other</i><span> priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites </span><i>were</i><span> more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span></div>

<div id='verse-632'>[35] <span>And also the burnt offerings </span><i>were</i><span> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for </span><i>every</i><span> burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</span></div>

<div id='verse-633'>[36] <span>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was </span><i>done</i><span> suddenly.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-634'>[1] <span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-635'>[2] <span>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</span></div>

<div id='verse-636'>[3] <span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-637'>[4] <span>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-638'>[5] <span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done </span><i>it</i><span> of a long </span><i>time in such sort</i><span> as it was written.</span></div>

<div id='verse-639'>[6] <span>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span></div>

<div id='verse-640'>[7] <span>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, </span><i>who</i><span> therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</span></div>

<div id='verse-641'>[8] <span>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers </span><i>were, but</i><span> yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-642'>[9] <span>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children </span><i>shall find</i><span> compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God </span><i>is</i><span> gracious and merciful, and will not turn away </span><i>his</i><span> face from you, if ye return unto him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-643'>[10] <span>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-644'>[11] <span>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-645'>[12] <span>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-646'>[13] <span>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-647'>[14] <span>And they arose and took away the altars that </span><i>were</i><span> in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast </span><i>them</i><span> into the brook Kidron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-648'>[15] <span>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth </span><i>day</i><span> of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-649'>[16] <span>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, </span><i>which they received</i><span> of the hand of the Levites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-650'>[17] <span>For </span><i>there were</i><span> many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one </span><i>that was</i><span> not clean, to sanctify </span><i>them</i><span> unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-651'>[18] <span>For a multitude of the people, </span><i>even</i><span> many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</span></div>

<div id='verse-652'>[19] <i>That</i><span> prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though </span><i>he be</i><span> not </span><i>cleansed</i><span> according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span></div>

<div id='verse-653'>[20] <span>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-654'>[21] <span>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, </span><i>singing</i><span> with loud instruments unto the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-655'>[22] <span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-656'>[23] <span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept </span><i>other</i><span> seven days with gladness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-657'>[24] <span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-658'>[25] <span>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span></div>

<div id='verse-659'>[26] <span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel </span><i>there was</i><span> not the like in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-660'>[27] <span>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came </span><i>up</i><span> to his holy dwelling place, </span><i>even</i><span> unto heaven.</span></div>

Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</span></div>

<div id='verse-662'>[2] <span>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-663'>[3] <i>He appointed</i><span> also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, </span><i>to wit</i><span>, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the law of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-666'>[6] <span>And </span><i>concerning</i><span> the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid </span><i>them</i><span> by heaps.</span></div>

<div id='verse-667'>[7] <span>In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished </span><i>them</i><span> in the seventh month.</span></div>

<div id='verse-671'>[11] <span>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared </span><i>them</i><span>,</span></div>

<div id='verse-672'>[12] <span>And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated </span><i>things</i><span> faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite </span><i>was</i><span> ruler, and Shimei his brother </span><i>was</i><span> the next.</span></div>

<div id='verse-673'>[13] <span>And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, </span><i>were</i><span> overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-674'>[14] <span>And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, </span><i>was</i><span> over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-693'>[12] <span>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</span></div>

<div id='verse-694'>[13] <span>Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of </span><i>other</i><span> lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-695'>[14] <span>Who </span><i>was there</i><span> among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-696'>[15] <span>Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-697'>[16] <span>And his servants spake yet </span><i>more</i><span> against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-698'>[17] <span>He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of </span><i>other</i><span> lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-699'>[18] <span>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that </span><i>were</i><span> on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-700'>[19] <span>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, </span><i>which were</i><span> the work of the hands of man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-701'>[20] <span>And for this </span><i>cause</i><span> Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-702'>[21] <span>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</span></div>

<div id='verse-703'>[22] <span>Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all </span><i>other</i><span>, and guided them on every side.</span></div>

<div id='verse-704'>[23] <span>And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-705'>[24] <span>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</span></div>

<div id='verse-706'>[25] <span>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit </span><i>done</i><span> unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-707'>[26] <span>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, </span><i>both</i><span> he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-708'>[27] <span>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</span></div>

<div id='verse-709'>[28] <span>Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</span></div>

<div id='verse-710'>[29] <span>Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</span></div>

<div id='verse-711'>[30] <span>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</span></div>

<div id='verse-712'>[31] <span>Howbeit in </span><i>the business of</i><span> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was </span><i>done</i><span> in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all </span><i>that was</i><span> in his heart.</span></div>

<div id='verse-713'>[32] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, </span><i>and</i><span> in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-714'>[33] <span>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-715'>[1] <span>Manasseh </span><i>was</i><span> twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</span></div>

<div id='verse-716'>[2] <span>But did </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-717'>[3] <span>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-718'>[4] <span>Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-719'>[5] <span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-720'>[6] <span>And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-721'>[7] <span>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</span></div>

<div id='verse-722'>[8] <span>Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-723'>[9] <span>So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, </span><i>and</i><span> to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-724'>[10] <span>And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</span></div>

<div id='verse-725'>[11] <span>Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-726'>[12] <span>And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</span></div>

<div id='verse-727'>[13] <span>And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he </span><i>was</i><span> God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-728'>[14] <span>Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-729'>[15] <span>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast </span><i>them</i><span> out of the city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-730'>[16] <span>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-731'>[17] <span>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, </span><i>yet</i><span> unto the LORD their God only.</span></div>

<div id='verse-732'>[18] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they </span><i>are written</i><span> in the book of the kings of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-733'>[19] <span>His prayer also, and </span><i>how God</i><span> was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written among the sayings of the seers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-734'>[20] <span>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-735'>[21] <span>Amon </span><i>was</i><span> two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-736'>[22] <span>But he did </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-737'>[23] <span>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-738'>[24] <span>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-739'>[25] <span>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-741'>[2] <span>And he did </span><i>that which was</i><span> right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined </span><i>neither</i><span> to the right hand, nor to the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-742'>[3] <span>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</span></div>

<div id='verse-743'>[4] <span>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that </span><i>were</i><span> on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust </span><i>of them</i><span>, and strowed </span><i>it</i><span> upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-744'>[5] <span>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-745'>[6] <span>And </span><i>so did he</i><span> in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</span></div>

<div id='verse-746'>[7] <span>And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-747'>[8] <span>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-748'>[9] <span>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-749'>[10] <span>And they put </span><i>it</i><span> in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</span></div>

<div id='verse-750'>[11] <span>Even to the artificers and builders gave they </span><i>it</i><span>, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-751'>[12] <span>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them </span><i>were</i><span> Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set </span><i>it</i><span> forward; and </span><i>other of</i><span> the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</span></div>

<div id='verse-752'>[13] <span>Also </span><i>they were</i><span> over the bearers of burdens, and </span><i>were</i><span> overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites </span><i>there were</i><span> scribes, and officers, and porters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-753'>[14] <span>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD </span><i>given</i><span> by Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-754'>[15] <span>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-755'>[16] <span>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-756'>[17] <span>And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-757'>[18] <span>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span></div>

<div id='verse-758'>[19] <span>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-759'>[20] <span>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-760'>[21] <span>Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great </span><i>is</i><span> the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</span></div>

<div id='verse-761'>[22] <span>And Hilkiah, and </span><i>they</i><span> that the king </span><i>had appointed</i><span>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that </span><i>effect</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-762'>[23] <span>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-763'>[24] <span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, </span><i>even</i><span> all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</span></div>

<div id='verse-764'>[25] <span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span></div>

<div id='verse-765'>[26] <span>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel </span><i>concerning</i><span> the words which thou hast heard;</span></div>

<div id='verse-766'>[27] <span>Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard </span><i>thee</i><span> also, saith the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-767'>[28] <span>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-768'>[29] <span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-769'>[30] <span>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-770'>[31] <span>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</span></div>

<div id='verse-771'>[32] <span>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand </span><i>to it</i><span>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-772'>[33] <span>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that </span><i>pertained</i><span> to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, </span><i>even</i><span> to serve the LORD their God. </span><i>And</i><span> all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-773'>[1] <span>Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth </span><i>day</i><span> of the first month.</span></div>

<div id='verse-774'>[2] <span>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</span></div>

<div id='verse-775'>[3] <span>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; </span><i>it shall</i><span> not </span><i>be</i><span> a burden upon </span><i>your</i><span> shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</span></div>

<div id='verse-776'>[4] <span>And prepare </span><i>yourselves</i><span> by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-777'>[5] <span>And stand in the holy </span><i>place</i><span> according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and </span><i>after</i><span> the division of the families of the Levites.</span></div>

<div id='verse-778'>[6] <span>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that </span><i>they</i><span> may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-779'>[7] <span>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these </span><i>were</i><span> of the king's substance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-780'>[8] <span>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred </span><i>small cattle</i><span>, and three hundred oxen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-781'>[9] <span>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand </span><i>small cattle</i><span>, and five hundred oxen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-782'>[10] <span>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-783'>[11] <span>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled </span><i>the blood</i><span> from their hands, and the Levites flayed </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-784'>[12] <span>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the book of Moses. And so </span><i>did they</i><span> with the oxen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-785'>[13] <span>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the </span><i>other</i><span> holy </span><i>offerings</i><span> sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided </span><i>them</i><span> speedily among all the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-786'>[14] <span>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron </span><i>were busied</i><span> in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-787'>[15] <span>And the singers the sons of Asaph </span><i>were</i><span> in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters </span><i>waited</i><span> at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-788'>[16] <span>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</span></div>

<div id='verse-789'>[17] <span>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-790'>[18] <span>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-791'>[19] <span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</span></div>

<div id='verse-792'>[20] <span>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-794'>[22] <span>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span></div>

<div id='verse-795'>[23] <span>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</span></div>

<div id='verse-796'>[24] <span>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in </span><i>one of</i><span> the sepulchres of his fathers.

<div id='verse-807'>[8] <span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they </span><i>are</i><span> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-808'>[9] <span>Jehoiachin </span><i>was</i><span> eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the sight of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-809'>[10] <span>And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-810'>[11] <span>Zedekiah </span><i>was</i><span> one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-811'>[12] <span>And he did </span><i>that which was</i><span> evil in the sight of the LORD his God, </span><i>and</i><span> humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet </span><i>speaking</i><span> from the mouth of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-812'>[13] <span>And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-813'>[14] <span>Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-814'>[15] <span>And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</span></div>

<div id='verse-815'>[16] <span>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till </span><i>there was</i><span> no remedy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-816'>[17] <span>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave </span><i>them</i><span> all into his hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-817'>[18] <span>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all </span><i>these</i><span> he brought to Babylon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-818'>[19] <span>And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-819'>[20] <span>And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</span></div>

<div id='verse-820'>[21] <span>To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: </span><i>for</i><span> as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-821'>[22] <span>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD </span><i>spoken</i><span> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and </span><i>put it</i><span> also in writing, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-822'>[23] <span>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which </span><i>is</i><span> in Judah. Who </span><i>is there</i><span> among you of all his people? The LORD his God </span><i>be</i><span> with him, and let him go up.</span></div>
