<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God </span><i>was</i><span> with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that </span><i>was</i><span> at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to </span><i>the place which</i><span> David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which </span><i>was</i><span> at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, </span><i>that is so</i><span> great?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Wisdom and knowledge </span><i>is</i><span> granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that </span><i>have been</i><span> before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Then Solomon came </span><i>from his journey</i><span> to the high place that </span><i>was</i><span> at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem </span><i>as plenteous</i><span> as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that </span><i>are</i><span> in the vale for abundance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred </span><i>shekels</i><span> of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out </span><i>horses</i><span> for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[3] <span>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, </span><i>even so deal with me</i><span>.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[5] <span>And the house which I build </span><i>is</i><span> great: for great </span><i>is</i><span> our God above all gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[6] <span>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who </span><i>am</i><span> I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[8] <span>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants </span><i>shall be</i><span> with thy servants,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[10] <span>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[11] <span>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[12] <span>Huram said moreover, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[13] <span>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[14] <span>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father </span><i>was</i><span> a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[15] <span>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[17] <span>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that </span><i>were</i><span> in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[2] <span>And he began to build in the second </span><i>day</i><span> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[3] <span>Now these </span><i>are the things wherein</i><span> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure </span><i>was</i><span> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[15] <span>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that </span><i>was</i><span> on the top of each of them </span><i>was</i><span> five cubits.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-682'>[28] <span>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: </span><i>and</i><span> all </span><i>this continued</i><span> until the burnt offering was finished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-683'>[29] <span>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-684'>[30] <span>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-685'>[31] <span>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-688'>[34] <span>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the </span><i>other</i><span> priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites </span><i>were</i><span> more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-689'>[35] <span>And also the burnt offerings </span><i>were</i><span> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for </span><i>every</i><span> burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-693'>[1] <span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-695'>[3] <span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-696'>[4] <span>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-697'>[5] <span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done </span><i>it</i><span> of a long </span><i>time in such sort</i><span> as it was written.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-698'>[6] <span>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-699'>[7] <span>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, </span><i>who</i><span> therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-704'>[12] <span>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-710'>[18] <span>For a multitude of the people, </span><i>even</i><span> many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-713'>[21] <span>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, </span><i>singing</i><span> with loud instruments unto the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-714'>[22] <span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-715'>[23] <span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept </span><i>other</i><span> seven days with gladness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-716'>[24] <span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-718'>[26] <span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel </span><i>there was</i><span> not the like in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-723'>[2] <span>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-724'>[3] <i>He appointed</i><span> also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, </span><i>to wit</i><span>, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the law of the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-727'>[6] <span>And </span><i>concerning</i><span> the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid </span><i>them</i><span> by heaps.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-760'>[16] <span>And his servants spake yet </span><i>more</i><span> against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-809'>[3] <span>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-810'>[4] <span>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that </span><i>were</i><span> on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust </span><i>of them</i><span>, and strowed </span><i>it</i><span> upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-817'>[11] <span>Even to the artificers and builders gave they </span><i>it</i><span>, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-820'>[14] <span>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD </span><i>given</i><span> by Moses.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-828'>[22] <span>And Hilkiah, and </span><i>they</i><span> that the king </span><i>had appointed</i><span>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that </span><i>effect</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-829'>[23] <span>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-832'>[26] <span>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel </span><i>concerning</i><span> the words which thou hast heard;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-837'>[31] <span>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-838'>[32] <span>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand </span><i>to it</i><span>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-843'>[2] <span>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-844'>[3] <span>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; </span><i>it shall</i><span> not </span><i>be</i><span> a burden upon </span><i>your</i><span> shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-845'>[4] <span>And prepare </span><i>yourselves</i><span> by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-848'>[7] <span>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these </span><i>were</i><span> of the king's substance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-849'>[8] <span>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred </span><i>small cattle</i><span>, and three hundred oxen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'>[9] <span>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand </span><i>small cattle</i><span>, and five hundred oxen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-851'>[10] <span>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-852'>[11] <span>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled </span><i>the blood</i><span> from their hands, and the Levites flayed </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-853'>[12] <span>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as </span><i>it is</i><span> written in the book of Moses.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-854'>[13] <span>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the </span><i>other</i><span> holy </span><i>offerings</i><span> sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided </span><i>them</i><span> speedily among all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-855'>[14] <span>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron </span><i>were busied</i><span> in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-856'>[15] <span>And the singers the sons of Asaph </span><i>were</i><span> in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters </span><i>waited</i><span> at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span></div>
