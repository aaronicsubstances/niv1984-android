<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel--to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Solomon answered God, "You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>God said to Solomon, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-745'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-755'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When Hezekiah says, `The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-756'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, `You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-757'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?</span></div>
