<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites--everyone whose heart God had moved--prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[15] <span>and he told him, `Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[16] <span>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[17] <span>Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'>[15] <span>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-220'>[20] <span>They also brought 220 of the temple servants--a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'>[21] <span>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'>[22] <span>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'>[23] <span>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-224'>[24] <span>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'>[25] <span>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'>[28] <span>I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'>[29] <span>Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'>[30] <span>Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'>[33] <span>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'>[34] <span>Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'>[35] <span>Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'>[36] <span>They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[13] <span>"What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[1] <span>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites--men, women and children--gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[2] <span>Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[3] <span>Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[4] <span>Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[5] <span>So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[6] <span>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[7] <span>A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[8] <span>Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[9] <span>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[10] <span>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[11] <span>Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[12] <span>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[13] <span>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[14] <span>Let our officials act for the whole assembly.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[15] <span>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[16] <span>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,</span></div>
