<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[9] <span>We questioned the elders and asked them, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[15] <span>and he told him, `Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[16] <span>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[17] <span>Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[4] <span>Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[5] <span>Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[6] <span>and prayed: "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[7] <span>From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[8] <span>"But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[9] <span>Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[10] <span>"But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[11] <span>you gave through your servants the prophets when you said: `The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[12] <span>Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[13] <span>"What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[14] <span>Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[15] <span>O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-255'>Chapter 10</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[1] <span>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites--men, women and children--gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[2] <span>Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[3] <span>Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[4] <span>Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[5] <span>So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[6] <span>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[7] <span>A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[8] <span>Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[9] <span>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[10] <span>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[11] <span>Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[12] <span>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: "You are right! We must do as you say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[13] <span>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[14] <span>Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[15] <span>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[16] <span>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[17] <span>and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'>[18] <span>Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women: From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[19] <span>(They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)</span></div>
