<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-5-11'>This is the answer they gave us: "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.

<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-5-13'>"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-5-16'>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished."

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-9-8'>"But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.
