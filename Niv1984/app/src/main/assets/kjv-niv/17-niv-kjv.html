<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Where were</i><span> white, green, and blue, </span><i>hangings</i><span>, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds </span><i>were of</i><span> gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the drinking </span><i>was</i><span> according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women </span><i>in</i><span> the royal house which </span><i>belonged</i><span> to king Ahasuerus.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by </span><i>his</i><span> chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so </span><i>was</i><span> the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and were closest to the king--Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the next unto him </span><i>was</i><span> Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, </span><i>and</i><span> Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, </span><i>and</i><span> which sat the first in the kingdom;)</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that </span><i>are</i><span> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, `King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>this</i><span> deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Likewise</i><span> shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus </span><i>shall there arise</i><span> too much contempt and wrath.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, proclaiming in each people's tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then thus came </span><i>every</i><span> maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested.

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, </span><i>even</i><span> Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told </span><i>it</i><span> unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king </span><i>thereof</i><span> in Mordecai's name.</span></div>
