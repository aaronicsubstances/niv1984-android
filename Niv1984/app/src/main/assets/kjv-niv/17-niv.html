<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> :</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king's palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest, who were in the citadel of Susa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him--Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and were closest to the king--Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, `King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, proclaiming in each people's tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-25'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> king of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl, who was also known as Esther, was lovely in form and features, and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Before a girl's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And this is how she would go to the king: Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthana </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-50'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the twelfth month, the month of Adar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"Keep the money," the king said to Haman, "and do with the people as you please."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews--young and old, women and little children--on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But he went only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that he be put to death. The only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Esther's words were reported to Mordecai,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>he sent back this answer: "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" the king asked. "Nothing has been done for him," his attendants answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>His attendants answered, "Haman is standing in the court." "Bring him in," the king ordered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When Haman entered, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?" Now Haman thought to himself, "Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So he answered the king, "For the man the king delights to honor,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Go at once," the king commanded Haman. "Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Afterward Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him--you will surely come to ruin!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and as they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life--this is my petition. And spare my people--this is my request.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, "Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman." Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, "A gallows seventy-five feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> high stands by Haman's house.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those seeking their destruction.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The number of those slain in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>That is why rural Jews--those living in villages--observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>(Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur.) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>the Jews took it upon themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city.
