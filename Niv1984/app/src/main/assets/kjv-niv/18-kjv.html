<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And his sons went and feasted </span><i>in their</i><span> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And it was so, when the days of </span><i>their</i><span> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings </span><i>according</i><span> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </span><i>there is</i><span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath </span><i>is</i><span> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And the Sabeans fell </span><i>upon them</i><span>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</span>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </span><i>there is</i><span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he </span><i>is</i><span> in thine hand; but save his life.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that </span><i>his</i><span> grief was very great.</span>
</div>

<hr>
<hr>
</div>
<div id='chapter-3'>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And Job spake, and said,</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night </span><i>in which</i><span> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>As </span><i>for</i><span> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but </span><i>have</i><span> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Because it shut not up the doors of my </span><i>mother's</i><span> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Why died I not from the womb? </span><i>why</i><span> did I </span><i>not</i><span> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants </span><i>which</i><span> never saw light.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>There the wicked cease </span><i>from</i><span> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<i>There</i><span> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>The small and great are there; and the servant </span><i>is</i><span> free from his master.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter </span><i>in</i><span> soul;</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Which long for death, but it </span><i>cometh</i><span> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Which rejoice exceedingly, </span><i>and</i><span> are glad, when they can find the grave?</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<i>Why is light given</i><span> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<i>If</i><span> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<i>Is</i><span> not </span><i>this</i><span> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Remember, I pray thee, who </span><i>ever</i><span> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image </span><i>was</i><span> before mine eyes, </span><i>there was</i><span> silence, and I heard a voice, </span><i>saying</i><span>,</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>How much less </span><i>in</i><span> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation </span><i>is</i><span> in the dust, </span><i>which</i><span> are crushed before the moth?</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding </span><i>it</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Doth not their excellency </span><i>which is</i><span> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</span>

<span>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither </span><i>is there</i><span> any to deliver </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform </span><i>their</i><span> enterprise.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Behold, happy </span><i>is</i><span> the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle </span><i>shall be</i><span> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Thou shalt know also that thy seed </span><i>shall be</i><span> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>Thou shalt come to </span><i>thy</i><span> grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</span>

<span>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For the arrows of the Almighty </span><i>are</i><span> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there </span><i>any</i><span> taste in the white of an egg?</span>

<div>[13]
<i>Is</i><span> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>To him that is afflicted pity </span><i>should be shewed</i><span> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</span>

</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span>

<span>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, </span><i>which are</i><span> as wind?</span>

<span>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</span>

<i>He is</i><span> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened </span><i>himself</i><span> against him, and hath prospered?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</span>
</div>

<span>Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</span>

<span>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</span>

<div>[8]
<span>Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</span>
</div>

<span>Lo, he goeth by me, and I see </span><i>him</i><span> not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</span>

<div>[18]
<span>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid </span><i>it</i><span>:</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>The wicked man travaileth with pain all </span><i>his</i><span> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>A dreadful sound </span><i>is</i><span> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>He wandereth abroad for bread, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Where </span><i>is it</i><span>? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>He runneth upon him, </span><i>even</i><span> on </span><i>his</i><span> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on </span><i>his</i><span> flanks.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>And he dwelleth in desolate cities, </span><i>and</i><span> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>For the congregation of hypocrites </span><i>shall be</i><span> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</span>
</div>

<span>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</span>

</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</span>

<span>I also could speak as ye </span><i>do</i><span>: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</span>

<div>[5]
<i>But</i><span> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage </span><i>your grief</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and </span><i>though</i><span> I forbear, what am I eased?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, </span><i>which</i><span> is a witness </span><i>against me</i><span>: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</span>

<div>[9]
<span>He teareth </span><i>me</i><span> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</span>

<div>[12]
<span>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken </span><i>me</i><span> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</span>

<div>[13]
<span>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</span>

<span>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</span>

<div>[2]
<span>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<i>Is it</i><span> any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or </span><i>is it</i><span> gain </span><i>to him</i><span>, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<i>Is</i><span> not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But </span><i>as for</i><span> the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Therefore snares </span><i>are</i><span> round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Or darkness, </span><i>that</i><span> thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<i>Is</i><span> not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Thick clouds </span><i>are</i><span> a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</span>
</div>

<div>[16]

</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Yet he filled their houses with good </span><i>things</i><span>: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span>

<div>[19]
<span>The righteous see </span><i>it</i><span>, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</span>

<div>[22]
<span>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</span>

</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</span>

<span>Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</span>

<span>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For he performeth </span><i>the thing that is</i><span> appointed for me: and many such </span><i>things are</i><span> with him.</span>

<span>Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</span>

<span>But now </span><i>they that are</i><span> younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Yea, whereto </span><i>might</i><span> the strength of their hands </span><i>profit</i><span> me, in whom old age was perished?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For want and famine </span><i>they were</i><span> solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots </span><i>for</i><span> their meat.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>They were driven forth from among </span><i>men</i><span>, (they cried after them as </span><i>after</i><span> a thief;)</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, </span><i>in</i><span> caves of the earth, and </span><i>in</i><span> the rocks.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<i>They were</i><span> children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Upon </span><i>my</i><span> right </span><i>hand</i><span> rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>They came </span><i>upon me</i><span> as a wide breaking in </span><i>of waters</i><span>: in the desolation they rolled themselves </span><i>upon me</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>By the great force </span><i>of my disease</i><span> is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me </span><i>not</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride </span><i>upon it</i><span>, and dissolvest my substance.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For I know </span><i>that</i><span> thou wilt bring me </span><i>to</i><span> death, and </span><i>to</i><span> the house appointed for all living.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Howbeit he will not stretch out </span><i>his</i><span> hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was </span><i>not</i><span> my soul grieved for the poor?</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>When I looked for good, then evil came </span><i>unto me</i><span>: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, </span><i>and</i><span> I cried in the congregation.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</span>
</div>

<span>My harp also is </span><i>turned</i><span> to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</span>

<span>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</span>

<span>For what portion of God </span><i>is there</i><span> from above? and </span><i>what</i><span> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</span>
</div>

<i>Is</i><span> not destruction to the wicked? and a strange </span><i>punishment</i><span> to the workers of iniquity?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<i>Then</i><span> let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or </span><i>if</i><span> I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<i>Then</i><span> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</span>

</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For it </span><i>is</i><span> a fire </span><i>that</i><span> consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</span>
</div>

<div>[16]

</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For destruction </span><i>from</i><span> God </span><i>was</i><span> a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</span>

</div>

<div>[29]
<span>If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</span>
</div>

<span>Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>The stranger did not lodge in the street: </span><i>but</i><span> I opened my doors to the traveller.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he </span><i>was</i><span> righteous in his own eyes.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and </span><i>yet</i><span> had condemned Job.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they </span><i>were</i><span> elder than he.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>When Elihu saw that </span><i>there was</i><span> no answer in the mouth of </span><i>these</i><span> three men, then his wrath was kindled.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I </span><i>am</i><span> young, and ye </span><i>are</i><span> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But </span><i>there is</i><span> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Great men are not </span><i>always</i><span> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, </span><i>there was</i><span> none of you that convinced Job, </span><i>or</i><span> that answered his words:</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Now he hath not directed </span><i>his</i><span> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, </span><i>and</i><span> answered no more;)</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<i>I said</i><span>, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Behold, my belly </span><i>is</i><span> as wine </span><i>which</i><span> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>For I know not to give flattering titles; </span><i>in so doing</i><span> my maker would soon take me away.</span>

<div id='chapter-33'>
<h2>Chapter 33</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>My words </span><i>shall be of</i><span> the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>If thou canst answer me, set </span><i>thy words</i><span> in order before me, stand up.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Behold, I </span><i>am</i><span> according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of </span><i>thy</i><span> words, </span><i>saying</i><span>,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>I am clean without transgression, I </span><i>am</i><span> innocent; neither </span><i>is there</i><span> iniquity in me.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Behold, </span><i>in</i><span> this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For God speaketh once, yea twice, </span><i>yet man</i><span> perceiveth it not.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>That he may withdraw man </span><i>from his</i><span> purpose, and hide pride from man.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong </span><i>pain</i><span>:</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones </span><i>that</i><span> were not seen stick out.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>He looketh upon men, and </span><i>if any</i><span> say, I have sinned, and perverted </span><i>that which was</i><span> right, and it profited me not;</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Lo, all these </span><i>things</i><span> worketh God oftentimes with man,</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</span>

<span>Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Hear my words, O ye wise </span><i>men</i><span>; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what </span><i>is</i><span> good.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Should I lie against my right? my wound </span><i>is</i><span> incurable without transgression.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>What man </span><i>is</i><span> like Job, </span><i>who</i><span> drinketh up scorning like water?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, </span><i>that he should do</i><span> wickedness; and </span><i>from</i><span> the Almighty, </span><i>that he should commit</i><span> iniquity.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to </span><i>his</i><span> ways.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>If he set his heart upon man, </span><i>if</i><span> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>If now </span><i>thou hast</i><span> understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<i>Is it fit</i><span> to say to a king, </span><i>Thou art</i><span> wicked? </span><i>and</i><span> to princes, </span><i>Ye are</i><span> ungodly?</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<i>How much less to him</i><span> that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all </span><i>are</i><span> the work of his hands.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>For his eyes </span><i>are</i><span> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<i>There is</i><span> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For he will not lay upon man more </span><i>than right</i><span>; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth </span><i>them</i><span> in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth </span><i>his</i><span> face, who then can behold him? whether </span><i>it be done</i><span> against a nation, or against a man only:</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne </span><i>chastisement</i><span>, I will not offend </span><i>any more</i><span>:</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<i>That which</i><span> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<i>Should it be</i><span> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words </span><i>were</i><span> without wisdom.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>My desire </span><i>is that</i><span> Job may be tried unto the end because of </span><i>his</i><span> answers for wicked men.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth </span><i>his hands</i><span> among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span>

<span>Thinkest thou this to be right, </span><i>that</i><span> thou saidst, My righteousness </span><i>is</i><span> more than God's?</span>

<span>Thy wickedness </span><i>may hurt</i><span> a man as thou </span><i>art</i><span>; and thy righteousness </span><i>may profit</i><span> the son of man.</span>

<span>Elihu also proceeded, and said,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that </span><i>I have</i><span> yet to speak on God's behalf.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For truly my words </span><i>shall</i><span> not </span><i>be</i><span> false: he that is perfect in knowledge </span><i>is</i><span> with thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Behold, God </span><i>is</i><span> mighty, and despiseth not </span><i>any: he is</i><span> mighty in strength </span><i>and</i><span> wisdom.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings </span><i>are they</i><span> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And if </span><i>they be</i><span> bound in fetters, </span><i>and</i><span> be holden in cords of affliction;</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>If they obey and serve </span><i>him</i><span>, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>They die in youth, and their life </span><i>is</i><span> among the unclean.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait </span><i>into</i><span> a broad place, where </span><i>there is</i><span> no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table </span><i>should be</i><span> full of fatness.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold </span><i>on thee</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Because </span><i>there is</i><span> wrath, </span><i>beware</i><span> lest he take thee away with </span><i>his</i><span> stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Will he esteem thy riches? </span><i>no</i><span>, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</span>
</div>

<span>Every man may see it; man may behold </span><i>it</i><span> afar off.</span>

<span>Behold, God </span><i>is</i><span> great, and we know </span><i>him</i><span> not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</span>

<span>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</span>

<span>He esteemeth iron as straw, </span><i>and</i><span> brass as rotten wood.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Sharp stones </span><i>are</i><span> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>He maketh a path to shine after him; </span><i>one</i><span> would think the deep </span><i>to be</i><span> hoary.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>He beholdeth all high </span><i>things</i><span>: he </span><i>is</i><span> a king over all the children of pride.</span>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I know that thou canst do every </span><i>thing</i><span>, and </span><i>that</i><span> no thought can be withholden from thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Who </span><i>is</i><span> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Wherefore I abhor </span><i>myself</i><span>, and repent in dust and ashes.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And it was </span><i>so</i><span>, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me </span><i>the thing that is</i><span> right, as my servant Job </span><i>hath</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you </span><i>after your</i><span> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me </span><i>the thing which is</i><span> right, like my servant Job.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite </span><i>and</i><span> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And in all the land were no women found </span><i>so</i><span> fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, </span><i>even</i><span> four generations.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>So Job died, </span><i>being</i><span> old and full of days.</span>
