<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>And his sons went and feasted </span><i>in their</i><span> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And it was so, when the days of </span><i>their</i><span> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings </span><i>according</i><span> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </span><i>there is</i><span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath </span><i>is</i><span> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And the Sabeans fell </span><i>upon them</i><span>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[1] <span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[2] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[3] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </span><i>there is</i><span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[4] <span>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[5] <span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[6] <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he </span><i>is</i><span> in thine hand; but save his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[7] <span>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[8] <span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[9] <span>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[10] <span>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[11] <span>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[12] <span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[13] <span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that </span><i>his</i><span> grief was very great.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-40'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[1] <span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[2] <span>And Job spake, and said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[3] <span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night </span><i>in which</i><span> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[4] <span>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[5] <span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[6] <span>As </span><i>for</i><span> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[7] <span>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[8] <span>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[9] <span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but </span><i>have</i><span> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[10] <span>Because it shut not up the doors of my </span><i>mother's</i><span> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[11] <span>Why died I not from the womb? </span><i>why</i><span> did I </span><i>not</i><span> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[12] <span>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[13] <span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[14] <span>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[15] <span>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[16] <span>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants </span><i>which</i><span> never saw light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[17] <span>There the wicked cease </span><i>from</i><span> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[18] <i>There</i><span> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[19] <span>The small and great are there; and the servant </span><i>is</i><span> free from his master.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[20] <span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter </span><i>in</i><span> soul;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[21] <span>Which long for death, but it </span><i>cometh</i><span> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[24] <span>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[25] <span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</span></div>
