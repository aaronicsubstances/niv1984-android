<h3>Job 1</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><i>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><i>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><i>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</i>

<h3>Job 42</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-42-1'><i>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-42-2'><i>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-42-3'><i>Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-42-4'><i>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-42-5'><i>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-42-6'><i>Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-42-7'><i>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-42-8'><i>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-42-9'><i>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-42-10'><i>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-42-11'><i>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-42-12'><i>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-42-13'><i>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-42-15'><i>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-42-16'><i>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-42-17'><i>So Job died, being old and full of days.</i>
