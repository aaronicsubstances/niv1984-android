<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And his sons went and feasted </span><i>in their</i><span> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And it was so, when the days of </span><i>their</i><span> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings </span><i>according</i><span> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that </span><i>there is</i><span> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath </span><i>is</i><span> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the Sabeans fell </span><i>upon them</i><span>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While he </span><i>was</i><span> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters </span><i>were</i><span> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that </span><i>his</i><span> grief was very great.</span></div>
