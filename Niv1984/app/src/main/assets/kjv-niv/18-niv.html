<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>He had seven sons and three daughters,</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>One day the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> also came with them.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. </span>

<div>[1]
<span>On another day the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</span>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>He said:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>May darkness and deep shadow </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>May those who curse days </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">2</a>]</sup><span> curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master. </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</span>

<span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.</span>

<span>A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.</span>

<span>It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>`Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,</span>

<div>[19]
<span>how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!</span>

<span>I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</span>

<span>For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</span>

<div>[7]
<span>Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. </span>

<span>He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.</span>

<div>[20]
<span>In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.</span>

<span>You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.</span>

<div>[3]
<span>It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas-- no wonder my words have been impetuous.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</span>

<div>[6]
<span>Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ?</span>

<span>I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill. </span>

<div>[8]
<span>"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!</span>

<div>[10]
<span>Then I would still have this consolation-- my joy in unrelenting pain-- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. </span>

<span>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>What he trusts in is fragile </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ; what he relies on is a spider's web.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, `I never saw you.'</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Surely its life withers away, and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">2</a>]</sup><span> from the soil other plants grow. </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>Then Job replied:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, `What are you doing?'</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ?</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>It is all the same; that is why I say, `He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it? </span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>If I say, `I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Even if I washed myself with soap </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and my hands with washing soda,</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me. </span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.</span>

<span>If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.</span>

<span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you. </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth? </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water! </span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>He wanders about--food for vultures </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield. </span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."</span>

<div>[3]
<span>Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief. </span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.</span>

<div>[11]
<span>God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.</span>

<span>All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;</span>

<div>[13]
<span>his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.</span>

</div>

<div>[3]
<span>"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?</span>

<span>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless? </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>though you were a powerful man, owning land-- an honored man, living on it.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!</span>

<span>They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</span>

<div>[23]
<span>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,</span>
</div>

<span>When men are brought low and you say, `Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.</span>

<div>[5]
<span>I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.</span>

<span>They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</span>

<span>When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.</span>

<div>[15]
<span>The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, `No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.</span>

<div>[11]
<span>Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,</span>

<span>The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.</span>

<span>I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.</span>

<span>I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</span>

<span>After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.</span>
</div>

<span>They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]

<div>[3]
<span>Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-30-1" id="niv-verse-30-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-30-2" id="niv-verse-30-2">2</a>]</sup><span> was the root of the broom tree.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.</span>

<span>They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</span>

<div>[14]
<span>They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud. </span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.</span>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-1" id="niv-verse-32-1">1</a>]</sup> 
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>I thought, `Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But it is the spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-2" id="niv-verse-32-2">2</a>]</sup><span> in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>It is not only the old </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-32-3" id="niv-verse-32-3">3</a>]</sup><span> who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Do not say, `We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;</span>

<div>[19]
<span>inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.</span>

<span>I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.</span>

<span>Is he not the One who says to kings, `You are worthless,' and to nobles, `You are wicked,'</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people. </span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>"Suppose a man says to God, `I am guilty but will offend no more.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. </span>

<span>Yet you ask him, `What profit is it to me, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-35-2" id="niv-verse-35-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and what do I gain by not sinning?' </span>
</div>

<span>Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>But no one says, `Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>who teaches more to us than to </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-35-3" id="niv-verse-35-3">3</a>]</sup><span> the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-35-4" id="niv-verse-35-4">4</a>]</sup><span> the birds of the air?'</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</span>
</div>

<div>[15]

<div>[4]
<span>Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you. </span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>he tells them what they have done-- that they have sinned arrogantly.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-36-1" id="niv-verse-36-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and die without knowledge. </span>

<div>[25]
<span>At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, `Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry. </span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he." </span>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The LORD said to Job:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Then Job answered the LORD:</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>"I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>I spoke once, but I have no answer-- twice, but I will say no more."</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>"Look at the behemoth, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-1" id="niv-verse-40-1">1</a>]</sup><span> which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>His tail </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-2" id="niv-verse-40-2">2</a>]</sup><span> sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Can anyone capture him by the eyes, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-3" id="niv-verse-40-3">3</a>]</sup><span> or trap him and pierce his nose? </span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>"Can you pull in the leviathan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-41-1" id="niv-verse-41-1">1</a>]</sup><span> with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>His back has </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-41-2" id="niv-verse-41-2">2</a>]</sup><span> rows of shields tightly sealed together;</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Nothing on earth is his equal-- a creature without fear.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."</span>

<h2>Chapter 42</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Then Job replied to the LORD:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>[You asked,] `Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>["You said,] `Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes." </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-42-1" id="niv-verse-42-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and a gold ring.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>And so he died, old and full of years. </span>
