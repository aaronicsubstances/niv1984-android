<h3>Job 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>He had seven sons and three daughters,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>One day the angels 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup> also came with them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_3">3</a>]</sup> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."

There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'>But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.

<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'>He replied, "You are talking like a foolish 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_202814600_2">2</a>]</sup> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-42-3'>[You asked,] `Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.

<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-42-7'>After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
