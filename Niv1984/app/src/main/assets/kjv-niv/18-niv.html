<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He had seven sons and three daughters,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>One day the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> also came with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</span></div>
