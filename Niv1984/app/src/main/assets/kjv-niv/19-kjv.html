<h2>Psalm 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>But his delight </span><i>is</i><span> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</span>

<span>The ungodly </span><i>are</i><span> not so: but </span><i>are</i><span> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</span>

<h2>Psalm 2</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</span>
</div>

<span>Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>The fool hath said in his heart, </span><i>There is</i><span> no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, </span><i>there is</i><span> none that doeth good.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, </span><i>and</i><span> seek God.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>They are all gone aside, they are </span><i>all</i><span> together become filthy: </span><i>there is</i><span> none that doeth good, no, not one.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people </span><i>as</i><span> they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>There were they in great fear: for God </span><i>is</i><span> in the generation of the righteous.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> his refuge.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Oh that the salvation of Israel </span><i>were come</i><span> out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, </span><i>and</i><span> Israel shall be glad.</span>

<h2>Psalm 18</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<span>To the chief Musician, </span><i>A Psalm</i><span> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day </span><i>that</i><span> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>The LORD </span><i>is</i><span> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, </span><i>and</i><span> my high tower.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>I will call upon the LORD, </span><i>who is worthy</i><span> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, </span><i>even</i><span> into his ears.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness </span><i>was</i><span> under his feet.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him </span><i>were</i><span> dark waters </span><i>and</i><span> thick clouds of the skies.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>At the brightness </span><i>that was</i><span> before him his thick clouds passed, hail </span><i>stones</i><span> and coals of fire.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail </span><i>stones</i><span> and coals of fire.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>For all his judgments </span><i>were</i><span> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<i>As for</i><span> God, his way </span><i>is</i><span> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he </span><i>is</i><span> a buckler to all those that trust in him.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>For who </span><i>is</i><span> God save the LORD? or who </span><i>is</i><span> a rock save our God?</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<i>It is</i><span> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>He maketh my feet like hinds' </span><i>feet</i><span>, and setteth me upon my high places.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span>
</div>

<div>[38]
<span>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</span>
</div>

<div>[39]
<span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[40]
<span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</span>
</div>

<div>[41]
<span>They cried, but </span><i>there was</i><span> none to save </span><i>them: even</i><span> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</span>
</div>

<div>[42]
<span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</span>
</div>

<div>[43]
<span>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; </span><i>and</i><span> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people </span><i>whom</i><span> I have not known shall serve me.</span>
</div>

<div>[44]
<span>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[45]
<span>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</span>
</div>

<div>[46]
<span>The LORD liveth; and blessed </span><i>be</i><span> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span>
</div>

<div>[47]
<i>It is</i><span> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</span>
</div>

<div>[48]
<span>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</span>
</div>

<div>[49]
<span>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</span>
</div>

<div>[50]
<span>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</span>

<span>For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<i>There is</i><span> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither </span><i>is there any</i><span> rest in my bones because of my sin.</span>

<span>For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>My wounds stink </span><i>and</i><span> are corrupt because of my foolishness.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For my loins are filled with a loathsome </span><i>disease</i><span>: and </span><i>there is</i><span> no soundness in my flesh.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</span>
</div>

<span>Lord, all my desire </span><i>is</i><span> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span>

<span>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</span>

<span>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</span>

<span>They also that seek after my life lay snares </span><i>for me</i><span>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</span>

<span>But I, as a deaf </span><i>man</i><span>, heard not; and </span><i>I was</i><span> as a dumb man </span><i>that</i><span> openeth not his mouth.</span>

<span>Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth </span><i>are</i><span> no reproofs.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, </span><i>what</i><span> work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<i>How</i><span> thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; </span><i>how</i><span> thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</span>

<span>Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto </span><i>my</i><span> soul.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I sink in deep mire, where </span><i>there is</i><span> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, </span><i>being</i><span> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored </span><i>that</i><span> which I took not away.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>When I wept, </span><i>and chastened</i><span> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I </span><i>was</i><span> the song of the drunkards.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>But as for me, my prayer </span><i>is</i><span> unto thee, O LORD, </span><i>in</i><span> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span>

<div>[15]
<span>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness </span><i>is</i><span> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Draw nigh unto my soul, </span><i>and</i><span> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries </span><i>are</i><span> all before thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked </span><i>for some</i><span> to take pity, but </span><i>there was</i><span> none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span>

<div>[28]
<span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</span>

</div>

<div>[30]
<span>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span>

<div>[31]
<i>This</i><span> also shall please the LORD better than an ox </span><i>or</i><span> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>The humble shall see </span><i>this, and</i><span> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</span>

</div>

<span>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</span>

<h2>Psalm 73</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<span>A Psalm of Asaph.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>Truly God </span><i>is</i><span> good to Israel, </span><i>even</i><span> to such as are of a clean heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For I was envious at the foolish, </span><i>when</i><span> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For </span><i>there are</i><span> no bands in their death: but their strength </span><i>is</i><span> firm.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>They </span><i>are</i><span> not in trouble </span><i>as other</i><span> men; neither are they plagued like </span><i>other</i><span> men.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them </span><i>as</i><span> a garment.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>They are corrupt, and speak wickedly </span><i>concerning</i><span> oppression: they speak loftily.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full </span><i>cup</i><span> are wrung out to them.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Behold, these </span><i>are</i><span> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase </span><i>in</i><span> riches.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Verily I have cleansed my heart </span><i>in</i><span> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend </span><i>against</i><span> the generation of thy children.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>When I thought to know this, it </span><i>was</i><span> too painful for me;</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Until I went into the sanctuary of God; </span><i>then</i><span> understood I their end.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>How are they </span><i>brought</i><span> into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>As a dream when </span><i>one</i><span> awaketh; </span><i>so</i><span>, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>So foolish </span><i>was</i><span> I, and ignorant: I was </span><i>as</i><span> a beast before thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Nevertheless I </span><i>am</i><span> continually with thee: thou hast holden </span><i>me</i><span> by my right hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me </span><i>to</i><span> glory.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Whom have I in heaven </span><i>but thee</i><span>? and </span><i>there is</i><span> none upon earth </span><i>that</i><span> I desire beside thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>My flesh and my heart faileth: </span><i>but</i><span> God </span><i>is</i><span> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>But </span><i>it is</i><span> good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</span>

<span>Maschil of Asaph.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>O God, why hast thou cast </span><i>us</i><span> off for ever? </span><i>why</i><span> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Remember thy congregation, </span><i>which</i><span> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, </span><i>which</i><span> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; </span><i>even</i><span> all </span><i>that</i><span> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns </span><i>for</i><span> signs.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<i>A man</i><span> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled </span><i>by casting down</i><span> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>We see not our signs: </span><i>there is</i><span> no more any prophet: neither </span><i>is there</i><span> among us any that knoweth how long.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck </span><i>it</i><span> out of thy bosom.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For God </span><i>is</i><span> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, </span><i>and</i><span> gavest him </span><i>to be</i><span> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>The day </span><i>is</i><span> thine, the night also </span><i>is</i><span> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Remember this, </span><i>that</i><span> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and </span><i>that</i><span> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude </span><i>of the wicked</i><span>: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</span>

<span>I cried unto God with my voice, </span><i>even</i><span> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</span>

<h2>Psalm 78</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<span>Maschil of Asaph.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>Give ear, O my people, </span><i>to</i><span> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>We will not hide </span><i>them</i><span> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>That the generation to come might know </span><i>them, even</i><span> the children </span><i>which</i><span> should be born; </span><i>who</i><span> should arise and declare </span><i>them</i><span> to their children:</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation </span><i>that</i><span> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The children of Ephraim, </span><i>being</i><span> armed, </span><i>and</i><span> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, </span><i>in</i><span> the field of Zoan.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave </span><i>them</i><span> drink as </span><i>out of</i><span> the great depths.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Therefore the LORD heard </span><i>this</i><span>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>And he let </span><i>it</i><span> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat </span><i>was</i><span> yet in their mouths,</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen </span><i>men</i><span> of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>And they remembered that God </span><i>was</i><span> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</span>
</div>

<div>[38]
<span>But he, </span><i>being</i><span> full of compassion, forgave </span><i>their</i><span> iniquity, and destroyed </span><i>them</i><span> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span>
</div>

<div>[39]
<span>For he remembered that they </span><i>were but</i><span> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span>
</div>

<div>[40]
<span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, </span><i>and</i><span> grieve him in the desert!</span>
</div>

<div>[41]
<span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[42]
<span>They remembered not his hand, </span><i>nor</i><span> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</span>
</div>

<div>[43]
<span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</span>
</div>

<div>[44]
<span>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</span>
</div>

<div>[45]
<span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span>
</div>

<div>[46]
<span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</span>
</div>

<div>[47]
<span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</span>
</div>

<div>[48]
<span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span>
</div>

<div>[49]
<span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels </span><i>among them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[50]
<span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span>
</div>

<div>[51]
<span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of </span><i>their</i><span> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</span>
</div>

<div>[52]
<span>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span>
</div>

<div>[53]
<span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span>
</div>

<div>[54]
<span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, </span><i>even to</i><span> this mountain, </span><i>which</i><span> his right hand had purchased.</span>
</div>

<div>[55]
<span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span>
</div>

<div>[56]
<span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span>
</div>

<div>[57]
<span>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span>
</div>

<div>[58]
<span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span>
</div>

<div>[59]
<span>When God heard </span><i>this</i><span>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span>
</div>

<div>[60]
<span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent </span><i>which</i><span> he placed among men;</span>
</div>

<div>[61]
<span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[62]
<span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span>
</div>

<div>[63]
<span>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</span>
</div>

<div>[64]
<span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span>
</div>

<div>[65]
<span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, </span><i>and</i><span> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span>
</div>

<div>[66]
<span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span>
</div>

<div>[67]
<span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span>
</div>

<div>[68]
<span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span>
</div>

<div>[69]
<span>And he built his sanctuary like high </span><i>palaces</i><span>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[70]
<span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span>
</div>

<div>[71]
<span>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span>
</div>

<div>[72]
<span>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span>

<h2>Psalm 79</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<span>A Psalm of Asaph.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>The dead bodies of thy servants have they given </span><i>to be</i><span> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and </span><i>there was</i><span> none to bury </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where </span><i>is</i><span> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight </span><i>by</i><span> the revenging of the blood of thy servants </span><i>which is</i><span> shed.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest </span><i>between</i><span> the cherubims, shine forth.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come </span><i>and</i><span> save us.</span>

<span>Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thou preparedst </span><i>room</i><span> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof </span><i>were like</i><span> the goodly cedars.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Why hast thou </span><i>then</i><span> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch </span><i>that</i><span> thou madest strong for thyself.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<i>It is</i><span> burned with fire, </span><i>it is</i><span> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man </span><i>whom</i><span> thou madest strong for thyself.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</span>

</div>

<div>[6]
<span>I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>I </span><i>am</i><span> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: </span><i>and</i><span> they walked in their own counsels.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, </span><i>and</i><span> Israel had walked in my ways!</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</span>

<h2>Psalm 102</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<span>A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Hide not thy face from me in the day </span><i>when</i><span> I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day </span><i>when</i><span> I call answer me speedily.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Mine enemies reproach me all the day; </span><i>and</i><span> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>My days </span><i>are</i><span> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Thou shalt arise, </span><i>and</i><span> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years </span><i>are</i><span> throughout all generations.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens </span><i>are</i><span> the work of thy hands.</span>

<h2>Psalm 103</h2>
<div class='fragment'>
<i>A Psalm</i><span> of David.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, </span><i>bless</i><span> his holy name.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good </span><i>things; so that</i><span> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>The LORD </span><i>is</i><span> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>He will not always chide: neither will he keep </span><i>his anger</i><span> for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>For as the heaven is high above the earth, </span><i>so</i><span> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>As far as the east is from the west, </span><i>so</i><span> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Like as a father pitieth </span><i>his</i><span> children, </span><i>so</i><span> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we </span><i>are</i><span> dust.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<i>As for</i><span> man, his days </span><i>are</i><span> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>But the mercy of the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</span>

<h2>Psalm 104</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Who coverest </span><i>thyself</i><span> with light as </span><i>with</i><span> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<i>Who</i><span> laid the foundations of the earth, </span><i>that</i><span> it should not be removed for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Thou coveredst it with the deep as </span><i>with</i><span> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</span>
</div>

<span>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, </span><i>which</i><span> run among the hills.</span>

<span>By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, </span><i>which</i><span> sing among the branches.</span>

<div>[16]
<span>The trees of the LORD are full </span><i>of sap</i><span>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Where the birds make their nests: </span><i>as for</i><span> the stork, the fir trees </span><i>are</i><span> her house.</span>

</div>

<div>[6]
<span>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He </span><i>is</i><span> the LORD our God: his judgments </span><i>are</i><span> in all the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word </span><i>which</i><span> he commanded to a thousand generations.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Which </span><i>covenant</i><span> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, </span><i>and</i><span> to Israel </span><i>for</i><span> an everlasting covenant:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When they were </span><i>but</i><span> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>When they went from one nation to another, from </span><i>one</i><span> kingdom to another people;</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<i>Saying</i><span>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>He sent a man before them, </span><i>even</i><span> Joseph, </span><i>who</i><span> was sold for a servant:</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>The king sent and loosed him; </span><i>even</i><span> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</span>

<div>[25]
<span>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</span>

<div>[26]
<span>He sent Moses his servant; </span><i>and</i><span> Aaron whom he had chosen.</span>

<span>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, </span><i>and</i><span> lice in all their coasts.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>He gave them hail for rain, </span><i>and</i><span> flaming fire in their land.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and </span><i>there was</i><span> not one feeble </span><i>person</i><span> among their tribes.</span>

<span>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span>

<span>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked </span><i>him</i><span> at the sea, </span><i>even</i><span> at the Red sea.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated </span><i>them</i><span>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>They envied Moses also in the camp, </span><i>and</i><span> Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, </span><i>and</i><span> terrible things by the Red sea.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>But murmured in their tents, </span><i>and</i><span> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Thus they provoked </span><i>him</i><span> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and </span><i>so</i><span> the plague was stayed.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>They angered </span><i>him</i><span> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</span>
</div>

<div>[38]
<span>And shed innocent blood, </span><i>even</i><span> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</span>
</div>

<div>[39]
<span>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</span>
</div>

<div>[40]
<span>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</span>
</div>

<div>[41]
<span>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</span>

<div>[43]
<span>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked </span><i>him</i><span> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</span>

<div>[13]
<span>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, </span><i>and</i><span> he saved them out of their distresses.</span>

</div>

<div>[25]
<span>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]

</div>

<div>[32]
<span>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</span>

<div>[33]
<span>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span>
</div>

<div>[38]
<span>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span>
</div>

<div>[39]
<span>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</span>
</div>

<div>[40]
<span>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, </span><i>where there is</i><span> no way.</span>

<span>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh </span><i>him</i><span> families like a flock.</span>

<span>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</span>
</div>

<div>[1]
<span>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For my love they are my adversaries: but I </span><i>give myself unto</i><span> prayer.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Let his days be few; </span><i>and</i><span> let another take his office.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek </span><i>their bread</i><span> also out of their desolate places.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</span>
</div>

<span>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Let his posterity be cut off; </span><i>and</i><span> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</span>

<span>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</span>

<span>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</span>
