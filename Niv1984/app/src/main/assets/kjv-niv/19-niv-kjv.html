<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1448'>[45] <span>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1408'>[7] <span>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1413'>[12] <span>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, </span><i>in</i><span> the field of Zoan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1414'>[13] <span>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1415'>[14] <span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1416'>[15] <span>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave </span><i>them</i><span> drink as </span><i>out of</i><span> the great depths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1417'>[16] <span>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1418'>[17] <span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1419'>[18] <span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1422'>[21] <span>Therefore the LORD heard </span><i>this</i><span>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1426'>[25] <span>Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1432'>[31] <span>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen </span><i>men</i><span> of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1433'>[32] <span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1434'>[33] <span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1435'>[34] <span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1436'>[35] <span>And they remembered that God </span><i>was</i><span> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1440'>[39] <span>For he remembered that they </span><i>were but</i><span> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1441'>[40] <span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, </span><i>and</i><span> grieve him in the desert!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1442'>[41] <span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1443'>[42] <span>They remembered not his hand, </span><i>nor</i><span> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1444'>[43] <span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1445'>[44] <span>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1446'>[45] <span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1447'>[46] <span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1448'>[47] <span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1449'>[48] <span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1450'>[49] <span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels </span><i>among them</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1451'>[50] <span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1452'>[51] <span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of </span><i>their</i><span> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1453'>[52] <span>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1454'>[53] <span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1455'>[54] <span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, </span><i>even to</i><span> this mountain, </span><i>which</i><span> his right hand had purchased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1456'>[55] <span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1457'>[56] <span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1458'>[57] <span>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1459'>[58] <span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1460'>[59] <span>When God heard </span><i>this</i><span>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1461'>[60] <span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent </span><i>which</i><span> he placed among men;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1462'>[61] <span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1463'>[62] <span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1464'>[63] <span>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1465'>[64] <span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1466'>[65] <span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, </span><i>and</i><span> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1467'>[66] <span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1468'>[67] <span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1469'>[68] <span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1470'>[69] <span>And he built his sanctuary like high </span><i>palaces</i><span>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1471'>[70] <span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1472'>[71] <span>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span></div>
