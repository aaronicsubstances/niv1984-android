<h2>Psalm 37</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> Of David. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-1" id="niv-verse-37-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-512'>[1] <span>Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;</span></div>

<div id='verse-513'>[2] <span>for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. </span></div>

<div id='verse-514'>[3] <span>Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</span></div>

<div id='verse-515'>[4] <span>Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. </span></div>

<div id='verse-516'>[5] <span>Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:</span></div>

<div id='verse-517'>[6] <span>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. </span></div>

<div id='verse-518'>[7] <span>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. </span></div>

<div id='verse-519'>[8] <span>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-520'>[9] <span>For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. </span></div>

<div id='verse-521'>[10] <span>A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</span></div>

<div id='verse-522'>[11] <span>But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. </span></div>

<div id='verse-523'>[12] <span>The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-524'>[13] <span>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. </span></div>

<div id='verse-525'>[14] <span>The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</span></div>

<div id='verse-526'>[15] <span>But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. </span></div>

<div id='verse-527'>[16] <span>Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</span></div>

<div id='verse-528'>[17] <span>for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. </span></div>

<div id='verse-529'>[18] <span>The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-530'>[19] <span>In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty. </span></div>

<div id='verse-531'>[20] <span>But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke. </span></div>

<div id='verse-532'>[21] <span>The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;</span></div>

<div id='verse-533'>[22] <span>those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off. </span></div>

<div id='verse-534'>[23] <span>If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;</span></div>

<div id='verse-535'>[24] <span>though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand. </span></div>

<div id='verse-536'>[25] <span>I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.</span></div>

<div id='verse-537'>[26] <span>They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed. </span></div>

<div id='verse-538'>[27] <span>Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-539'>[28] <span>For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</span></div>

<div id='verse-540'>[29] <span>the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. </span></div>

<div id='verse-541'>[30] <span>The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.</span></div>

<div id='verse-542'>[31] <span>The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip. </span></div>

<div id='verse-543'>[32] <span>The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;</span></div>

<div id='verse-544'>[33] <span>but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial. </span></div>

<div id='verse-545'>[34] <span>Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it. </span></div>

<div id='verse-546'>[35] <span>I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,</span></div>

<div id='verse-547'>[36] <span>but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found. </span></div>

<div id='verse-548'>[37] <span>Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-2" id="niv-verse-37-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for the man of peace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-549'>[38] <span>But all sinners will be destroyed; the future </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-3" id="niv-verse-37-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of the wicked will be cut off. </span></div>

<div id='verse-550'>[39] <span>The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</span></div>

<div id='verse-551'>[40] <span>The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him. </span></div>

<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A psalm of David. A petition.</span></div>

<div id='verse-552'>[1] <span>O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-553'>[2] <span>For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-554'>[3] <span>Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-555'>[4] <span>My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. </span></div>

<div id='verse-556'>[5] <span>My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-557'>[6] <span>I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.</span></div>

<div id='verse-558'>[7] <span>My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.</span></div>

<div id='verse-559'>[8] <span>I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. </span></div>

<div id='verse-560'>[9] <span>All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-561'>[10] <span>My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-562'>[11] <span>My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-563'>[12] <span>Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception. </span></div>

<div id='verse-564'>[13] <span>I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;</span></div>

<div id='verse-565'>[14] <span>I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</span></div>

<div id='verse-566'>[15] <span>I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-567'>[16] <span>For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips." </span></div>

<div id='verse-568'>[17] <span>For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-569'>[18] <span>I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-570'>[19] <span>Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-571'>[20] <span>Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good. </span></div>

<div id='verse-572'>[21] <span>O LORD, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-574'>[1] <span>I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."</span></div>

<div id='verse-575'>[2] <span>But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.</span></div>

<div id='verse-576'>[3] <span>My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: </span></div>

<div id='verse-577'>[4] <span>"Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-578'>[5] <span>You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah</span></div>

<div id='verse-579'>[6] <span>Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it. </span></div>

<div id='verse-580'>[7] <span>"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-581'>[8] <span>Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.</span></div>

<div id='verse-582'>[9] <span>I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.</span></div>

<div id='verse-583'>[10] <span>Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-584'>[11] <span>You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth-- each man is but a breath. Selah </span></div>

<div id='verse-585'>[12] <span>"Hear my prayer, O LORD, listen to my cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien, a stranger, as all my fathers were.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 40</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</span></div>

<div id='verse-587'>[1] <span>I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-588'>[2] <span>He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-589'>[3] <span>He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD. </span></div>

<div id='verse-590'>[4] <span>Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-1" id="niv-verse-40-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-591'>[5] <span>Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare. </span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[10] <span>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly. </span></div>

<div id='verse-597'>[11] <span>Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-598'>[12] <span>For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me. </span></div>

<div id='verse-710'>[1] <span>Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,</span></div>

<div id='verse-714'>[5] <span>Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me--</span></div>

<div id='verse-715'>[6] <span>those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?</span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. According to mahalath. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-53-1" id="niv-verse-53-1">a</a>]</sup><span> A maskil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-53-2" id="niv-verse-53-2">b</a>]</sup><span> of David.</span></div>

<div id='verse-781'>[1] <span>The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good. </span></div>

<div id='verse-782'>[2] <span>God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-783'>[3] <span>Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. </span></div>

<div id='verse-784'>[4] <span>Will the evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?</span></div>

<div id='verse-785'>[5] <span>There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them. </span></div>

<div id='verse-786'>[6] <span>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! </span></div>

<div id='verse-794'>[1] <span>Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;</span></div>

<div id='verse-807'>[14] <span>with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of God. </span></div>

<div id='verse-808'>[15] <span>Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the grave, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-55-2" id="niv-verse-55-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for evil finds lodging among them. </span></div>

<div id='verse-809'>[16] <span>But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-810'>[17] <span>Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-812'>[19] <span>God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them-- Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1209'>[35] <span>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1210'>[36] <span>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1211'>[37] <span>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1212'>[38] <span>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1213'>[39] <span>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1214'>[40] <span>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</span></div>

<div id='verse-1215'>[41] <span>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1216'>[42] <span>They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1217'>[43] <span>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1218'>[44] <span>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1219'>[45] <span>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1220'>[46] <span>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1221'>[47] <span>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1222'>[48] <span>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1223'>[49] <span>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1224'>[50] <span>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1225'>[51] <span>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1226'>[52] <span>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1227'>[53] <span>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1228'>[54] <span>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1229'>[55] <span>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1230'>[56] <span>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1231'>[57] <span>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1232'>[58] <span>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1233'>[59] <span>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1234'>[60] <span>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1235'>[61] <span>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1236'>[62] <span>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1237'>[63] <span>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1238'>[64] <span>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1239'>[65] <span>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1240'>[66] <span>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1241'>[67] <span>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1242'>[68] <span>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1243'>[69] <span>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1244'>[70] <span>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1245'>[71] <span>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1246'>[72] <span>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1817'>[1] <span>O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1818'>[2] <span>for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1819'>[3] <span>With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1820'>[4] <span>In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1821'>[5] <span>They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1823'>[7] <span>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1834'>[18] <span>He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1836'>[20] <span>May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1837'>[21] <span>But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1838'>[22] <span>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1839'>[23] <span>I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1840'>[24] <span>My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1841'>[25] <span>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1842'>[26] <span>Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1843'>[27] <span>Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1844'>[28] <span>They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1845'>[29] <span>My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. </span></div>

<div id='verse-1846'>[30] <span>With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1847'>[31] <span>For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him. </span></div>
