<h2>Psalm 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 2</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Why do the nations conspire </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and the peoples plot in vain?</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against his Anointed One. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[3] <span>"Let us break their chains," they say, "and throw off their fetters." </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>"I have installed my King </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup><span> on Zion, my holy hill."</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>I will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me, "You are my Son </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup><span> ; today I have become your Father. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[8] <span>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>You will rule them with an iron scepter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">6</a>]</sup><span> ; you will dash them to pieces like pottery." </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.</span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. According to sheminith. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">1</a>]</sup><span> A psalm of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Help, LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Everyone lies to his neighbor; their flattering lips speak with deception. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>that says, "We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-2" id="niv-verse-12-2">2</a>]</sup><span> --who is our master?" </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>"Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will protect them from those who malign them."</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>And the words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>O LORD, you will keep us safe and protect us from such people forever.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honored among men. </span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. A psalm of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me? </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Look on me and answer, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death;</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," and my foes will rejoice when I fall. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I will sing to the LORD, for he has been good to me. </span></div>

<div>[1] <span>The fool </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">1</a>]</sup><span> says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. </span></div>

<div>[2] <span>The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Will evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD?</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. </span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A prayer of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer-- it does not rise from deceitful lips.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 18</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. He sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>I love you, O LORD, my strength. </span></div>

<div>[2] <span>The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">1</a>]</sup><span> of my salvation, my stronghold.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>The cords of the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">2</a>]</sup><span> coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him-- the dark rain clouds of the sky.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-3" id="niv-verse-18-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[14] <span>He shot his arrows and scattered [the enemies], great bolts of lightning and routed them.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. </span></div>

<div>[25] <span>To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>With your help I can advance against a troop </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-4" id="niv-verse-18-4">4</a>]</sup><span> ; with my God I can scale a wall. </span></div>

<div>[30] <span>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?</span></div>

<div>[32] <span>It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>You give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me; you stoop down to make me great.</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn. </span></div>

<div>[37] <span>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.</span></div>

<div>[39] <span>You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</span></div>

<div>[40] <span>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</span></div>

<div>[41] <span>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them-- to the LORD, but he did not answer.</span></div>

<div>[42] <span>I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets. </span></div>

<div>[43] <span>You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me.</span></div>

<div>[44] <span>As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me.</span></div>

<div>[45] <span>They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds. </span></div>

<div>[46] <span>The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior!</span></div>

<div>[47] <span>He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me,</span></div>

<div>[48] <span>who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.</span></div>

<div>[49] <span>Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O LORD; I will sing praises to your name.</span></div>

<div>[50] <span>He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever. </span></div>

<div>[1] <span>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[4] <span>In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him." </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-2" id="niv-verse-22-2">2</a>]</sup><span> in the dust of death.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-3" id="niv-verse-22-3">3</a>]</sup><span> my hands and my feet.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth--</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>But the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>May your unfailing love rest upon us, O LORD, even as we put our hope in you. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 34</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> Of David. When he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-34-1" id="niv-verse-34-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[1] <span>I will extol the LORD at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>My soul will boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Glorify the LORD with me; let us exalt his name together. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>This poor man called, and the LORD heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days,</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking lies.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. </span></div>

<div>[15] <span>The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry;</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. </span></div>

<div>[17] <span>The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>A righteous man may have many troubles, but the LORD delivers him from them all;</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken. </span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Take up shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Brandish spear and javelin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-35-1" id="niv-verse-35-1">1</a>]</sup><span> against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation." </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>may ruin overtake them by surprise-- may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>My whole being will exclaim, "Who is like you, O LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them." </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-35-2" id="niv-verse-35-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ; they gnashed their teeth at me.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it." </span></div>

<div>[22] <span>O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up." </span></div>

<div>[26] <span>May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, "The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 36</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-36-1" id="niv-verse-36-1">1</a>]</sup><span> There is no fear of God before his eyes.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 37</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> Of David. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-1" id="niv-verse-37-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[1] <span>Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. </span></div>

<div>[14] <span>The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. </span></div>

<div>[18] <span>The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke. </span></div>

<div>[21] <span>The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off. </span></div>

<div>[23] <span>If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand. </span></div>

<div>[25] <span>I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed. </span></div>

<div>[27] <span>Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. </span></div>

<div>[30] <span>The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip. </span></div>

<div>[32] <span>The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial. </span></div>

<div>[34] <span>Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it. </span></div>

<div>[35] <span>I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found. </span></div>

<div>[37] <span>Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-2" id="niv-verse-37-2">2</a>]</sup><span> for the man of peace.</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>But all sinners will be destroyed; the future </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-37-3" id="niv-verse-37-3">3</a>]</sup><span> of the wicked will be cut off. </span></div>

<div>[39] <span>The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips." </span></div>

<div>[17] <span>For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good. </span></div>

<div>[2] <span>But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-2" id="niv-verse-40-2">2</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-3" id="niv-verse-40-3">3</a>]</sup><span> ; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. A maskil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-42-1" id="niv-verse-42-1">1</a>]</sup><span> of the Sons of Korah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-42-2" id="niv-verse-42-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[1] <span>As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>my God. My </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-42-3" id="niv-verse-42-3">3</a>]</sup><span> soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me-- a prayer to the God of my life. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?" </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 44</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-44-1" id="niv-verse-44-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[1] <span>We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>You are my King and my God, who decrees </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-44-2" id="niv-verse-44-2">2</a>]</sup><span> victories for Jacob.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge. </span></div>

<div>[17] <span>All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. </span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression? </span></div>

<div>[25] <span>We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>they saw [her] and were astounded; they fled in terror.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever. Selah </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 49</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>both low and high, rich and poor alike:</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me--</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him--</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough--</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>that he should live on forever and not see decay. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Their tombs will remain their houses </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-1" id="niv-verse-49-1">1</a>]</sup><span> forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-2" id="niv-verse-49-2">2</a>]</sup><span> named lands after themselves. </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-3" id="niv-verse-49-3">3</a>]</sup><span> like the beasts that perish. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Like sheep they are destined for the grave, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-4" id="niv-verse-49-4">4</a>]</sup><span> and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-5" id="niv-verse-49-5">5</a>]</sup><span> far from their princely mansions.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>But God will redeem my life </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-49-6" id="niv-verse-49-6">6</a>]</sup><span> from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases;</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Though while he lived he counted himself blessed-- and men praise you when you prosper--</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light [of life]. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>"Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>"Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>"Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue:</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>at the voice of the enemy, at the stares of the wicked; for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death assail me.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest--</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them-- Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords. </span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals. </span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see them </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-64-1" id="niv-verse-64-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ?"</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him! </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing praise to your name." Selah </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works in man's behalf!</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot-- come, let us rejoice in him.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations-- let not the rebellious rise up against him. Selah </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you--</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 68</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. A song.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>As smoke is blown away by the wind, may you blow them away; as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Sing to God, sing praise to his name, extol him who rides on the clouds </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-1" id="niv-verse-68-1">1</a>]</sup><span> -- his name is the LORD-- and rejoice before him.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>God sets the lonely in families, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-2" id="niv-verse-68-2">2</a>]</sup><span> he leads forth the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>When you went out before your people, O God, when you marched through the wasteland, Selah</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, O God, you provided for the poor. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it:</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>"Kings and armies flee in haste; in the camps men divide the plunder.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Even while you sleep among the campfires, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-3" id="niv-verse-68-3">3</a>]</sup><span> the wings of [my] dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold."</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>When the Almighty </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-4" id="niv-verse-68-4">4</a>]</sup><span> scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Zalmon. </span></div>

<div>[15] <span>The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains; rugged are the mountains of Bashan.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Why gaze in envy, O rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the LORD himself will dwell forever?</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord [has come] from Sinai into his sanctuary.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>When you ascended on high, you led captives in your train; you received gifts from men, even from </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-5" id="niv-verse-68-5">5</a>]</sup><span> the rebellious-- that you, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-6" id="niv-verse-68-6">6</a>]</sup><span> O LORD God, might dwell there. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Selah</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death. </span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>The Lord says, "I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea,</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share." </span></div>

<div>[24] <span>Your procession has come into view, O God, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the maidens playing tambourines.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah's princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali. </span></div>

<div>[28] <span>Summon your power, O God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-7" id="niv-verse-68-7">7</a>]</sup><span> ; show us your strength, O God, as you have done before.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-68-8" id="niv-verse-68-8">8</a>]</sup><span> will submit herself to God. </span></div>

<div>[32] <span>Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, Selah</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>to him who rides the ancient skies above, who thunders with mighty voice.</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst. </span></div>

<div>[22] <span>May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-69-1" id="niv-verse-69-1">1</a>]</sup><span> a trap.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous. </span></div>

<div>[29] <span>I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me. </span></div>

<div>[30] <span>I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 73</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A psalm of Asaph.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. </span></div>

<div>[2] <span>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-73-1" id="niv-verse-73-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[5] <span>They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>From their callous hearts comes iniquity </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-73-2" id="niv-verse-73-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-73-3" id="niv-verse-73-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[11] <span>They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?" </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>This is what the wicked are like-- always carefree, they increase in wealth. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning. </span></div>

<div>[15] <span>If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny. </span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies. </span></div>

<div>[21] <span>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. </span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. </span></div>

<div>[27] <span>Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds. </span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A maskil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-74-1" id="niv-verse-74-1">1</a>]</sup><span> of Asaph.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed-- Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them! </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter. </span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name. </span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually. </span></div>

<div>[2] <span>You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 77</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired: </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" Selah </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right hand of the Most High."</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 78</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A maskil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-78-1" id="niv-verse-78-1">1</a>]</sup><span> of Asaph.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>They would not be like their forefathers-- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. </span></div>

<div>[17] <span>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. </span></div>

<div>[32] <span>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</span></div>

<div>[37] <span>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</span></div>

<div>[39] <span>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. </span></div>

<div>[40] <span>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</span></div>

<div>[41] <span>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</span></div>

<div>[42] <span>They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</span></div>

<div>[43] <span>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</span></div>

<div>[44] <span>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</span></div>

<div>[45] <span>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</span></div>

<div>[46] <span>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</span></div>

<div>[47] <span>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</span></div>

<div>[48] <span>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</span></div>

<div>[49] <span>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</span></div>

<div>[50] <span>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</span></div>

<div>[51] <span>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</span></div>

<div>[52] <span>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</span></div>

<div>[53] <span>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</span></div>

<div>[54] <span>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</span></div>

<div>[55] <span>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. </span></div>

<div>[56] <span>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</span></div>

<div>[57] <span>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</span></div>

<div>[58] <span>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</span></div>

<div>[59] <span>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</span></div>

<div>[60] <span>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</span></div>

<div>[61] <span>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</span></div>

<div>[62] <span>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[63] <span>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</span></div>

<div>[64] <span>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. </span></div>

<div>[65] <span>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</span></div>

<div>[66] <span>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</span></div>

<div>[67] <span>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</span></div>

<div>[68] <span>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</span></div>

<div>[69] <span>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</span></div>

<div>[70] <span>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</span></div>

<div>[71] <span>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[72] <span>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 90</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A prayer of Moses the man of God.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>You turn men back to dust, saying, "Return to dust, O sons of men."</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>You sweep men away in the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of the morning--</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is dry and withered. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>The length of our days is seventy years-- or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-90-1" id="niv-verse-90-1">1</a>]</sup><span> is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Relent, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children. </span></div>

<div>[17] <span>May the favor </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-90-2" id="niv-verse-90-2">2</a>]</sup><span> of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us-- yes, establish the work of our hands. </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked. </span></div>

<div>[1] <span>O LORD, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked be jubilant? </span></div>

<div>[4] <span>They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They crush your people, O LORD; they oppress your inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>They say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed." </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge?</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile. </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law;</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O LORD, supported me.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Can a corrupt throne be allied with you-- one that brings on misery by its decrees?</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 103</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> Of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits--</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field;</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD's love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children--</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. </span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, O my soul. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 104</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>He makes winds his messengers, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-104-1" id="niv-verse-104-1">1</a>]</sup><span> flames of fire his servants. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate-- bringing forth food from the earth:</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-104-2" id="niv-verse-104-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[19] <span>The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening. </span></div>

<div>[24] <span>How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there. </span></div>

<div>[27] <span>These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth. </span></div>

<div>[31] <span>May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--</span></div>

<div>[32] <span>he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke. </span></div>

<div>[33] <span>I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-104-3" id="niv-verse-104-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Psalm 105</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit." </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm." </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>and he sent a man before them-- Joseph, sold as a slave.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom. </span></div>

<div>[23] <span>Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>He sent darkness and made the land dark-- for had they not rebelled against his words?</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</span></div>

<div>[32] <span>He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood. </span></div>

<div>[37] <span>He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</span></div>

<div>[39] <span>He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</span></div>

<div>[40] <span>They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</span></div>

<div>[41] <span>He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert. </span></div>

<div>[42] <span>For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.</span></div>

<div>[43] <span>He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</span></div>

<div>[44] <span>he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for--</span></div>

<div>[45] <span>that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-105-1" id="niv-verse-105-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Psalm 106</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Praise the LORD. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-106-1" id="niv-verse-106-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-106-2" id="niv-verse-106-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[8] <span>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. </span></div>

<div>[13] <span>But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked. </span></div>

<div>[19] <span>At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>So he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them. </span></div>

<div>[24] <span>Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. </span></div>

<div>[28] <span>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. </span></div>

<div>[32] <span>By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</span></div>

<div>[33] <span>for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-106-3" id="niv-verse-106-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[34] <span>They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</span></div>

<div>[37] <span>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</span></div>

<div>[39] <span>They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves. </span></div>

<div>[40] <span>Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</span></div>

<div>[41] <span>He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</span></div>

<div>[42] <span>Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</span></div>

<div>[43] <span>Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin. </span></div>

<div>[44] <span>But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</span></div>

<div>[45] <span>for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</span></div>

<div>[46] <span>He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive. </span></div>

<div>[47] <span>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. </span></div>

<div>[48] <span>Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD. </span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. </span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>He sent forth his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy. </span></div>

<div>[24] <span>They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep.</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>They reeled and staggered like drunken men; they were at their wits' end.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.</span></div>

<div>[30] <span>They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</span></div>

<div>[32] <span>Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. </span></div>

<div>[33] <span>He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,</span></div>

<div>[34] <span>and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.</span></div>

<div>[35] <span>He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;</span></div>

<div>[36] <span>there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.</span></div>

<div>[37] <span>They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;</span></div>

<div>[38] <span>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish. </span></div>

<div>[39] <span>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;</span></div>

<div>[40] <span>he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.</span></div>

<h2>Psalm 109</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship. </span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Appoint </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-1" id="niv-verse-109-1">1</a>]</sup><span> an evil man </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-2" id="niv-verse-109-2">2</a>]</sup><span> to oppose him; let an accuser </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-3" id="niv-verse-109-3">3</a>]</sup><span> stand at his right hand.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-4" id="niv-verse-109-4">4</a>]</sup><span> from their ruined homes.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>May their sins always remain before the LORD, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. </span></div>

<div>[16] <span>For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>He loved to pronounce a curse-- may it </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-5" id="niv-verse-109-5">5</a>]</sup><span> come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing-- may it be </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-109-6" id="niv-verse-109-6">6</a>]</sup><span> far from him.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me. </span></div>

<div>[21] <span>But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads. </span></div>

<div>[26] <span>Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.</span></div>

<div>[27] <span>Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.</span></div>

<div>[28] <span>They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.</span></div>

<div>[29] <span>My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. </span></div>

<div>[30] <span>With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.</span></div>

<div>[31] <span>For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 143</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> A psalm of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>O LORD, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant. </span></div>

<h2>Psalm 144</h2>
<div>
<div class='fragment'>[0] <span> Of David.</span></div>

<div>[1] <span>Praise be to the LORD my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-144-1" id="niv-verse-144-1">1</a>]</sup><span> under me. </span></div>

<div>[3] <span>O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him?</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow. </span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Send forth lightning and scatter [the enemies]; shoot your arrows and rout them.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful. </span></div>

<div>[9] <span>I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword. </span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful. </span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>our oxen will draw heavy loads. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-144-2" id="niv-verse-144-2">2</a>]</sup><span> There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets. </span></div>

<div>[7] <span>They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness. </span></div>

<div>[8] <span>The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>The LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>All you have made will praise you, O LORD; your saints will extol you.</span></div>
