<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>A wise </span><i>man</i><span> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>The fear of the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> the beginning of knowledge: </span><i>but</i><span> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>For they </span><i>shall be</i><span> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And they lay wait for their </span><i>own</i><span> blood; they lurk privily for their </span><i>own</i><span> lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>So </span><i>are</i><span> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; </span><i>which</i><span> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, </span><i>saying</i><span>,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</span></div>
