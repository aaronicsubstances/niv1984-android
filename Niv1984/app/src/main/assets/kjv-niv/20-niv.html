<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance--</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> despise wisdom and discipline. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>let's swallow them alive, like the grave, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse"--</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it. </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>at the head of the noisy streets </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech: </span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>"How long will you simple ones </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you--</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. </span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm." </span>

<span>My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. </span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup>

<div>[18]
<span>For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.</span>

<div>[20]
<span>Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</span>

</div>

<div>[2]
<span>for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity. </span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man. </span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup> 
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline and do not resent his rebuke,</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">2</a>]</sup><span> the son he delights in. </span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed. </span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew. </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble;</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared. </span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"-- when you now have it with you. </span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Do not accuse a man for no reason-- when he has done you no harm. </span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence. </span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.</span>

</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother,</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands and you will live.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or swerve from them.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> get understanding.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Esteem her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor." </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>For they cannot sleep till they do evil; they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. </span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble. </span>

<span>Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife? </span>

<span>Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy. </span>

<span>There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers. </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.</span>

<div>[22]
<span>When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?</span>

<div>[29]
<span>So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished. </span>

<span>Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.</span>

<span>At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in. </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>(She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>"I have fellowship offerings </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">1</a>]</sup><span> at home; today I fulfilled my vows.</span>

<span>I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.</span>
</div>

<span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.</span>

<span>Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!</span>

<span>He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon." </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">2</a>]</sup><span> stepping into a noose </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">3</a>]</sup>

</div>

<div>[4]
<span>"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.</span>

<div>[5]
<span>You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.</span>
</div>

<span>My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.</span>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings. </span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Remove the dross from the silver, and out comes material for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-1" id="niv-verse-25-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the silversmith;</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness. </span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among great men;</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman. What you have seen with your eyes</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>do not bring </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-25-2" id="niv-verse-25-2">2</a>]</sup><span> hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame? </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear. </span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Like the coolness of snow at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the spirit of his masters. </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone. </span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>If you find honey, eat just enough-- too much of it, and you will vomit.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house-- too much of you, and he will hate you. </span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor. </span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble. </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you. </span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>As a north wind brings rain, so a sly tongue brings angry looks. </span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. </span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land. </span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked. </span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor. </span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control. </span>

<div>[1]
<span>Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool. </span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest. </span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>A whip for the horse, a halter for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools! </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself. </span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes. </span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Like cutting off one's feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool. </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Like a lame man's legs that hang limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or any passer-by. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. </span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!" </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. </span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly. </span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Like one who seizes a dog by the ears is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own. </span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Like a madman shooting firebrands or deadly arrows</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>is a man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I was only joking!" </span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down. </span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. </span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts. </span>
</div>

<div>[24]

</div>

<div>[25]
<span>Though his speech is charming, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. </span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him. </span>

<span>Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both. </span>

<span>Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? </span>

<span>Better is open rebuke than hidden love. </span>

<span>Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses. </span>

<span>He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet. </span>

<span>Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel. </span>

<span>Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt. </span>

<span>A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day;</span>

<span>The wicked man flees though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. </span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order. </span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>A ruler </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-1" id="niv-verse-28-1">1</a>]</sup><span> who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them. </span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it fully. </span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse. </span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>He who keeps the law is a discerning son, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>He who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor. </span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable. </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>He who leads the upright along an evil path will fall into his own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance. </span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>A rich man may be wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has discernment sees through him. </span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; but when the wicked rise to power, men go into hiding. </span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. </span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Blessed is the man who always fears the LORD, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble. </span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people. </span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment, but he who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long life. </span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>A man tormented by the guilt of murder will be a fugitive till death; let no one support him. </span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>He whose walk is blameless is kept safe, but he whose ways are perverse will suddenly fall. </span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. </span>

<div>[20]
<span>A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. </span>

<div>[21]
<span>To show partiality is not good-- yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. </span>

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The sayings of King Lemuel--an oracle </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-1" id="niv-verse-31-1">1</a>]</sup><span> his mother taught him:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>"O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-2" id="niv-verse-31-2">2</a>]</sup> 
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings. </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>"It is not for kings, O Lemuel-- not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish;</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. </span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy." </span>
</div>

<div>[10]
 <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-3" id="niv-verse-31-3">3</a>]</sup><span> A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.</span>
