<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'><b>(NIV)</b> "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</i>

<h3>Ecclesiastes 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'><b>(NIV)</b> I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.

<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'><b>(NIV)</b> I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.

<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-2-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-2-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'><b>(NIV)</b> Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'><b>(NIV)</b> I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'><b>(NIV)</b> The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.

<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'><b>(NIV)</b> Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-2-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'><b>(NIV)</b> For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!

<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-2-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'><b>(NIV)</b> So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'><b>(NIV)</b> And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-2-19'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-2-20'><b>(NIV)</b> So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-2-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-2-21'><b>(NIV)</b> For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-2-21'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-2-22'><b>(NIV)</b> What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-2-23'><b>(NIV)</b> All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.

<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-2-23'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</i>
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-2-26'><b>(NIV)</b> To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-2-26'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.
