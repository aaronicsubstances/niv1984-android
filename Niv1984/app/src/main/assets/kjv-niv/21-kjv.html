<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I said of laughter, </span><i>It is</i><span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what </span><i>was</i><span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all </span><i>kind of</i><span> fruits:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>I got </span><i>me</i><span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, </span><i>as</i><span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all </span><i>was</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and </span><i>there was</i><span> no profit under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what </span><i>can</i><span> the man </span><i>do</i><span> that cometh after the king? </span><i>even</i><span> that which hath been already done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The wise man's eyes </span><i>are</i><span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now </span><i>is</i><span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise </span><i>man</i><span>? as the fool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun </span><i>is</i><span> grievous unto me: for all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise </span><i>man</i><span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This </span><i>is</i><span> also vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For there is a man whose labour </span><i>is</i><span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it </span><i>for</i><span> his portion. This also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and a great evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For all his days </span><i>are</i><span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <i>There is</i><span> nothing better for a man, </span><i>than</i><span> that he should eat and drink, and </span><i>that</i><span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it </span><i>was</i><span> from the hand of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten </span><i>hereunto</i><span>, more than I?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For </span><i>God</i><span> giveth to a man that </span><i>is</i><span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to </span><i>him that is</i><span> good before God.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-220'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-221'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-222'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty </span><i>themselves</i><span> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-224'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>As thou knowest not what </span><i>is</i><span> the way of the spirit, </span><i>nor</i><span> how the bones </span><i>do grow</i><span> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-225'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both </span><i>shall be</i><span> alike good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-226'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Truly the light </span><i>is</i><span> sweet, and a pleasant </span><i>thing it is</i><span> for the eyes to behold the sun:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-227'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But if a man live many years, </span><i>and</i><span> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these </span><i>things</i><span> God will bring thee into judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth </span><i>are</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-232'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-233'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, </span><i>and</i><span> set in order many proverbs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and </span><i>that which was</i><span> written </span><i>was</i><span> upright, </span><i>even</i><span> words of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The words of the wise </span><i>are</i><span> as goads, and as nails fastened </span><i>by</i><span> the masters of assemblies, </span><i>which</i><span> are given from one shepherd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books </span><i>there is</i><span> no end; and much study </span><i>is</i><span> a weariness of the flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this </span><i>is</i><span> the whole </span><i>duty</i><span> of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether </span><i>it be</i><span> good, or whether </span><i>it be</i><span> evil.</span></div>
