<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <i>One</i><span> generation passeth away, and </span><i>another</i><span> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea </span><i>is</i><span> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>All things </span><i>are</i><span> full of labour; man cannot utter </span><i>it</i><span>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>The thing that hath been, it </span><i>is that</i><span> which shall be; and that which is done </span><i>is</i><span> that which shall be done: and </span><i>there is</i><span> no new </span><i>thing</i><span> under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Is there </span><i>any</i><span> thing whereof it may be said, See, this </span><i>is</i><span> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <i>There is</i><span> no remembrance of former </span><i>things</i><span>; neither shall there be </span><i>any</i><span> remembrance of </span><i>things</i><span> that are to come with </span><i>those</i><span> that shall come after.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all </span><i>things</i><span> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <i>That which is</i><span> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all </span><i>they</i><span> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>For in much wisdom </span><i>is</i><span> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-21'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>I said of laughter, </span><i>It is</i><span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what </span><i>was</i><span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all </span><i>kind of</i><span> fruits:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>I got </span><i>me</i><span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, </span><i>as</i><span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all </span><i>was</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and </span><i>there was</i><span> no profit under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what </span><i>can</i><span> the man </span><i>do</i><span> that cometh after the king? </span><i>even</i><span> that which hath been already done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>The wise man's eyes </span><i>are</i><span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now </span><i>is</i><span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise </span><i>man</i><span>? as the fool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun </span><i>is</i><span> grievous unto me: for all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise </span><i>man</i><span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This </span><i>is</i><span> also vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>For there is a man whose labour </span><i>is</i><span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it </span><i>for</i><span> his portion. This also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and a great evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>For all his days </span><i>are</i><span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[24] <i>There is</i><span> nothing better for a man, </span><i>than</i><span> that he should eat and drink, and </span><i>that</i><span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it </span><i>was</i><span> from the hand of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[25] <span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten </span><i>hereunto</i><span>, more than I?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[26] <span>For </span><i>God</i><span> giveth to a man that </span><i>is</i><span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to </span><i>him that is</i><span> good before God. This also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
