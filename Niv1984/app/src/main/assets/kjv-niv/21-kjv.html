<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <i>One</i><span> generation passeth away, and </span><i>another</i><span> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea </span><i>is</i><span> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>All things </span><i>are</i><span> full of labour; man cannot utter </span><i>it</i><span>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>The thing that hath been, it </span><i>is that</i><span> which shall be; and that which is done </span><i>is</i><span> that which shall be done: and </span><i>there is</i><span> no new </span><i>thing</i><span> under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>Is there </span><i>any</i><span> thing whereof it may be said, See, this </span><i>is</i><span> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <i>There is</i><span> no remembrance of former </span><i>things</i><span>; neither shall there be </span><i>any</i><span> remembrance of </span><i>things</i><span> that are to come with </span><i>those</i><span> that shall come after.</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all </span><i>things</i><span> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <i>That which is</i><span> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all </span><i>they</i><span> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>For in much wisdom </span><i>is</i><span> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-19'>[1] <span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[2] <span>I said of laughter, </span><i>It is</i><span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[3] <span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what </span><i>was</i><span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[4] <span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[5] <span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all </span><i>kind of</i><span> fruits:</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[6] <span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[7] <span>I got </span><i>me</i><span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[8] <span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, </span><i>as</i><span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[9] <span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[10] <span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[11] <span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all </span><i>was</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and </span><i>there was</i><span> no profit under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[12] <span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what </span><i>can</i><span> the man </span><i>do</i><span> that cometh after the king? </span><i>even</i><span> that which hath been already done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[13] <span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[14] <span>The wise man's eyes </span><i>are</i><span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[15] <span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[16] <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now </span><i>is</i><span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise </span><i>man</i><span>? as the fool.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[17] <span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun </span><i>is</i><span> grievous unto me: for all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[18] <span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[19] <span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise </span><i>man</i><span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This </span><i>is</i><span> also vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[20] <span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[21] <span>For there is a man whose labour </span><i>is</i><span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it </span><i>for</i><span> his portion. This also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and a great evil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[22] <span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[23] <span>For all his days </span><i>are</i><span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[24] <i>There is</i><span> nothing better for a man, </span><i>than</i><span> that he should eat and drink, and </span><i>that</i><span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it </span><i>was</i><span> from the hand of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[25] <span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten </span><i>hereunto</i><span>, more than I?</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[26] <span>For </span><i>God</i><span> giveth to a man that </span><i>is</i><span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to </span><i>him that is</i><span> good before God. This also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[3] <span>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[8] <span>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[9] <span>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[10] <span>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[11] <span>He hath made every </span><i>thing</i><span> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[12] <span>I know that </span><i>there is</i><span> no good in them, but for </span><i>a man</i><span> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[13] <span>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it </span><i>is</i><span> the gift of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[14] <span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth </span><i>it</i><span>, that </span><i>men</i><span> should fear before him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[15] <span>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[16] <span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, </span><i>that</i><span> wickedness </span><i>was</i><span> there; and the place of righteousness, </span><i>that</i><span> iniquity </span><i>was</i><span> there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[17] <span>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for </span><i>there is</i><span> a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[18] <span>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[19] <span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[20] <span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[1] <span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of </span><i>such as were</i><span> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors </span><i>there was</i><span> power; but they had no comforter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[2] <span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[3] <span>Yea, better </span><i>is he</i><span> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[4] <span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This </span><i>is</i><span> also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[9] <span>Two </span><i>are</i><span> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[10] <span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him </span><i>that is</i><span> alone when he falleth; for </span><i>he hath</i><span> not another to help him up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[11] <span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm </span><i>alone</i><span>?</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[12] <span>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[13] <span>Better </span><i>is</i><span> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[14] <span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also </span><i>he that is</i><span> born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[15] <span>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[16] <i>There is</i><span> no end of all the people, </span><i>even</i><span> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-83'>[1] <span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[2] <span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter </span><i>any</i><span> thing before God: for God </span><i>is</i><span> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[3] <span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice </span><i>is known</i><span> by multitude of words.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[4] <span>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for </span><i>he hath</i><span> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[5] <span>Better </span><i>is it</i><span> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[6] <span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it </span><i>was</i><span> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[14] <span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[15] <span>All </span><i>things</i><span> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just </span><i>man</i><span> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked </span><i>man</i><span> that prolongeth </span><i>his life</i><span> in his wickedness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-130'>[16] <span>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[18] <i>It is</i><span> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[1] <span>Who </span><i>is</i><span> as the wise </span><i>man</i><span>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[2] <span>I </span><i>counsel thee</i><span> to keep the king's commandment, and </span><i>that</i><span> in regard of the oath of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[3] <span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[4] <span>Where the word of a king </span><i>is, there is</i><span> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[5] <span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[6] <span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man </span><i>is</i><span> great upon him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[7] <span>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[8] <i>There is</i><span> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither </span><i>hath he</i><span> power in the day of death: and </span><i>there is</i><span> no discharge in </span><i>that</i><span> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[9] <span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: </span><i>there is</i><span> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[10] <span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this </span><i>is</i><span> also vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[11] <span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[12] <span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his </span><i>days</i><span> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[13] <span>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong </span><i>his</i><span> days, </span><i>which are</i><span> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[14] <span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just </span><i>men</i><span>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked </span><i>men</i><span>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[15] <span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[16] <span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also </span><i>there is that</i><span> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[17] <span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek </span><i>it</i><span> out, yet he shall not find </span><i>it</i><span>; yea further; though a wise </span><i>man</i><span> think to know </span><i>it</i><span>, yet shall he not be able to find </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-161'>[1] <span>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, </span><i>are</i><span> in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred </span><i>by</i><span> all </span><i>that is</i><span> before them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[2] <span>All </span><i>things come</i><span> alike to all: </span><i>there is</i><span> one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as </span><i>is</i><span> the good, so </span><i>is</i><span> the sinner; </span><i>and</i><span> he that sweareth, as </span><i>he</i><span> that feareth an oath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[3] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> an evil among all </span><i>things</i><span> that are done under the sun, that </span><i>there is</i><span> one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness </span><i>is</i><span> in their heart while they live, and after that </span><i>they go</i><span> to the dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[4] <span>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[5] <span>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[6] <span>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any </span><i>thing</i><span> that is done under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[7] <span>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[8] <span>Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[9] <span>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that </span><i>is</i><span> thy portion in </span><i>this</i><span> life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[10] <span>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do </span><i>it</i><span> with thy might; for </span><i>there is</i><span> no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[11] <span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race </span><i>is</i><span> not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[12] <span>For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so </span><i>are</i><span> the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[13] <span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it </span><i>seemed</i><span> great unto me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[14] <i>There was</i><span> a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[15] <span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[16] <span>Then said I, Wisdom </span><i>is</i><span> better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom </span><i>is</i><span> despised, and his words are not heard.</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[17] <span>The words of wise </span><i>men are</i><span> heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</span></div>
