<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>"Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly--my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> as well--the delights of the heart of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[24] <span>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[25] <span>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[26] <span>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>I said of laughter, </span><i>It is</i><span> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what </span><i>was</i><span> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all </span><i>kind of</i><span> fruits:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>I got </span><i>me</i><span> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, </span><i>as</i><span> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all </span><i>was</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit, and </span><i>there was</i><span> no profit under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what </span><i>can</i><span> the man </span><i>do</i><span> that cometh after the king? </span><i>even</i><span> that which hath been already done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>The wise man's eyes </span><i>are</i><span> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also </span><i>is</i><span> vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now </span><i>is</i><span> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise </span><i>man</i><span>? as the fool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun </span><i>is</i><span> grievous unto me: for all </span><i>is</i><span> vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise </span><i>man</i><span> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>For there is a man whose labour </span><i>is</i><span> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it </span><i>for</i><span> his portion.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>For all his days </span><i>are</i><span> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[24] <i>There is</i><span> nothing better for a man, </span><i>than</i><span> that he should eat and drink, and </span><i>that</i><span> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[26] <span>For </span><i>God</i><span> giveth to a man that </span><i>is</i><span> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to </span><i>him that is</i><span> good before God.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[1] <span>Who is like the wise man? Who knows the explanation of things? Wisdom brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[2] <span>Obey the king's command, I say, because you took an oath before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[3] <span>Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[4] <span>Since a king's word is supreme, who can say to him, "What are you doing?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[5] <span>Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[6] <span>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a man's misery weighs heavily upon him. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[7] <span>Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[8] <span>No man has power over the wind to contain it </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ; so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[9] <span>All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> hurt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[10] <span>Then too, I saw the wicked buried--those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[11] <span>When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[12] <span>Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[13] <span>Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'>[14] <span>There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'>[15] <span>So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174'>[16] <span>When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe man's labor on earth--his eyes not seeing sleep day or night--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'>[17] <span>then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-167'>[9] <span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: </span><i>there is</i><span> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-173'>[15] <span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-174'>[16] <span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also </span><i>there is that</i><span> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-175'>[17] <span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek </span><i>it</i><span> out, yet he shall not find </span><i>it</i><span>; yea further; though a wise </span><i>man</i><span> think to know </span><i>it</i><span>, yet shall he not be able to find </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[15] <span>Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[16] <span>So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[17] <span>The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</span></div>
