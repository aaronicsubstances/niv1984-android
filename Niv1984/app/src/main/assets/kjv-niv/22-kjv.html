<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The song of songs, which </span><i>is</i><span> Solomon's.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love </span><i>is</i><span> better than wine.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name </span><i>is as</i><span> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>I </span><i>am</i><span> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Look not upon me, because I </span><i>am</i><span> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; </span><i>but</i><span> mine own vineyard have I not kept.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest </span><i>thy flock</i><span> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Thy cheeks are comely with rows </span><i>of jewels</i><span>, thy neck with chains </span><i>of gold</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>While the king </span><i>sitteth</i><span> at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>A bundle of myrrh </span><i>is</i><span> my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>My beloved </span><i>is</i><span> unto me </span><i>as</i><span> a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Behold, thou </span><i>art</i><span> fair, my love; behold, thou </span><i>art</i><span> fair; thou </span><i>hast</i><span> doves' eyes.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Behold, thou </span><i>art</i><span> fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed </span><i>is</i><span> green.</span>

<span>As the lily among thorns, so </span><i>is</i><span> my love among the daughters.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so </span><i>is</i><span> my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit </span><i>was</i><span> sweet to my taste.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me </span><i>was</i><span> love.</span>

<div>[5]
<span>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I </span><i>am</i><span> sick of love.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>His left hand </span><i>is</i><span> under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</span>

<span>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake </span><i>my</i><span> love, till he please.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over </span><i>and</i><span> gone;</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing </span><i>of birds</i><span> is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</span>

<div>[13]
<span>The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines </span><i>with</i><span> the tender grape give a </span><i>good</i><span> smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>O my dove, </span><i>that art</i><span> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret </span><i>places</i><span> of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet </span><i>is</i><span> thy voice, and thy countenance </span><i>is</i><span> comely.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines </span><i>have</i><span> tender grapes.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>My beloved </span><i>is</i><span> mine, and I </span><i>am</i><span> his: he feedeth among the lilies.</span>

<span>By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>The watchmen that go about the city found me: </span><i>to whom I said</i><span>, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<i>It was</i><span> but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</span>

<span>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake </span><i>my</i><span> love, till he please.</span>

<span>Thy lips </span><i>are</i><span> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech </span><i>is</i><span> comely: thy temples </span><i>are</i><span> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Thy neck </span><i>is</i><span> like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</span>

<span>Come with me from Lebanon, </span><i>my</i><span> spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, </span><i>my</i><span> spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</span>

<span>I am come into my garden, my sister, </span><i>my</i><span> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>I sleep, but my heart waketh: </span><i>it is</i><span> the voice of my beloved that knocketh, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, </span><i>and</i><span> my locks with the drops of the night.</span>

<div>[3]
<span>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span>

<div>[4]
<span>My beloved put in his hand by the hole </span><i>of the door</i><span>, and my bowels were moved for him.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped </span><i>with</i><span> myrrh, and my fingers </span><i>with</i><span> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, </span><i>and</i><span> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</span>

<span>My beloved </span><i>is</i><span> white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</span>

<span>His eyes </span><i>are</i><span> as </span><i>the eyes</i><span> of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, </span><i>and</i><span> fitly set.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>His cheeks </span><i>are</i><span> as a bed of spices, </span><i>as</i><span> sweet flowers: his lips </span><i>like</i><span> lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>His hands </span><i>are as</i><span> gold rings set with the beryl: his belly </span><i>is as</i><span> bright ivory overlaid </span><i>with</i><span> sapphires.</span>

<span>His legs </span><i>are as</i><span> pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance </span><i>is</i><span> as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span>

<span>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me </span><i>like</i><span> the chariots of Amminadib.</span>
