<span>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth-- for your love is more delightful than wine.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Take me away with you--let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you! </span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup> 
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.</span>

<span>Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens.</span>

<span>Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.</span>
</div>

<span>He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love.</span>

<span>Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>My lover spoke and said to me, "Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come with me.</span>

<span>See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.</span>

<span>Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.</span>

<div>[16]
<span>My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.</span>

<span>The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?"</span>

<span>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, coming up from the washing. Each has its twin; not one of them is alone.</span>
