<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, </span><i>and</i><span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: </span><i>but</i><span> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head </span><i>there is</i><span> no soundness in it; </span><i>but</i><span> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Your country </span><i>is</i><span> desolate, your cities </span><i>are</i><span> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and </span><i>it is</i><span> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, </span><i>and</i><span> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>To what purpose </span><i>is</i><span> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; </span><i>it is</i><span> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken </span><i>it</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Thy princes </span><i>are</i><span> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners </span><i>shall be</i><span> together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, </span><i>that</i><span> the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and </span><i>are</i><span> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</span>

<div>[7]
<span>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither </span><i>is there any</i><span> end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither </span><i>is there any</i><span> end of their chariots:</span>

<div>[8]
<span>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</span>

</div>

<div>[11]
<span>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For the day of the LORD of hosts </span><i>shall be</i><span> upon every </span><i>one that is</i><span> proud and lofty, and upon every </span><i>one that is</i><span> lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, </span><i>that are</i><span> high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills </span><i>that are</i><span> lifted up,</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made </span><i>each one</i><span> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</span>

<span>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</span>

<span>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</span>

</div>

<div>[13]
<span>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor </span><i>is</i><span> in your houses.</span>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; </span><i>and</i><span> break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts </span><i>is</i><span> the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Woe unto them that join house to house, </span><i>that</i><span> lay field to field, till </span><i>there be</i><span> no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>In mine ears </span><i>said</i><span> the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, </span><i>even</i><span> great and fair, without inhabitant.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</span>

<div>[11]
<span>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, </span><i>that</i><span> they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, </span><i>till</i><span> wine inflame them!</span>

<span>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</span>

<div>[13]
<span>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because </span><i>they have</i><span> no knowledge: and their honourable men </span><i>are</i><span> famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</span>

<div>[14]
<span>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</span>

<span>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</span>

<span>Woe unto </span><i>them that are</i><span> wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</span>

<span>Woe unto </span><i>them that are</i><span> mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</span>

<span>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</span>

<span>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</span>

<span>And he laid </span><i>it</i><span> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</span>

<span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, </span><i>even</i><span> the son of Tabeal:</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>For the head of Syria </span><i>is</i><span> Damascus, and the head of Damascus </span><i>is</i><span> Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>And the head of Ephraim </span><i>is</i><span> Samaria, and the head of Samaria </span><i>is</i><span> Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</span>

<div>[10]
<span>Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; </span><i>Is it</i><span> a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; </span><i>even</i><span> the king of Assyria.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And it shall come to pass in that day, </span><i>that</i><span> the LORD shall hiss for the fly that </span><i>is</i><span> in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that </span><i>is</i><span> in the land of Assyria.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, </span><i>namely</i><span>, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>And it shall come to pass in that day, </span><i>that</i><span> a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk </span><i>that</i><span> they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</span>

<span>Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</span>

<div>[3]
<span>And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.</span>

<span>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</span>

</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach </span><i>even</i><span> to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</span>

<div>[9]
<span>Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God </span><i>is</i><span> with us.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all </span><i>them to</i><span> whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</span>

<span>Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and </span><i>let</i><span> him </span><i>be</i><span> your fear, and </span><i>let</i><span> him </span><i>be</i><span> your dread.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</span>

<span>For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</span>

<span>Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city </span><i>where</i><span> David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And thou shalt be brought down, </span><i>and</i><span> shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones </span><i>shall be</i><span> as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>It shall even be as when an hungry </span><i>man</i><span> dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, </span><i>he is</i><span> faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</span>

<span>Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</span>

<div>[10]
<span>For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which </span><i>men</i><span> deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it </span><i>is</i><span> sealed:</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near </span><i>me</i><span> with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, </span><i>even</i><span> a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise </span><i>men</i><span> shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent </span><i>men</i><span> shall be hid.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<i>Is</i><span> it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>The meek also shall increase </span><i>their</i><span> joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</span>

<div>[2]
<span>That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt </span><i>your</i><span> confusion.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>They were all ashamed of a people </span><i>that</i><span> could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence </span><i>come</i><span> the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people </span><i>that</i><span> shall not profit </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength </span><i>is</i><span> to sit still.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>That this </span><i>is</i><span> a rebellious people, lying children, children </span><i>that</i><span> will not hear the law of the LORD:</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water </span><i>withal</i><span> out of the pit.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>One thousand </span><i>shall flee</i><span> at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> a God of judgment: blessed </span><i>are</i><span> all they that wait for him.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>And </span><i>though</i><span> the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This </span><i>is</i><span> the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.</span>

<span>And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers </span><i>and</i><span> streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning </span><i>with</i><span> his anger, and the burden </span><i>thereof is</i><span> heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:</span>
</div>

<span>Ye shall have a song, as in the night </span><i>when</i><span> a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</span>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, </span><i>that</i><span> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence </span><i>is</i><span> this wherein thou trustest?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>I say, </span><i>sayest thou</i><span>, (but </span><i>they are but</i><span> vain words) </span><i>I have</i><span> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so </span><i>is</i><span> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: </span><i>is it</i><span> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand </span><i>it</i><span>: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that </span><i>are</i><span> on the wall.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? </span><i>hath he</i><span> not </span><i>sent me</i><span> to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make </span><i>an agreement</i><span> with me </span><i>by</i><span> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<i>Beware</i><span> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>Where </span><i>are</i><span> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where </span><i>are</i><span> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Who </span><i>are they</i><span> among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that </span><i>was</i><span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with </span><i>their</i><span> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span>
</div>

<hr>
<hr>
</div>
<div id='chapter-37'>
<h2>Chapter 37</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard </span><i>it</i><span>, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And he sent Eliakim, who </span><i>was</i><span> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day </span><i>is</i><span> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and </span><i>there is</i><span> not strength to bring forth.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up </span><i>thy</i><span> prayer for the remnant that is left.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, </span><i>as</i><span> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which </span><i>were</i><span> in Telassar?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Where </span><i>is</i><span> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest </span><i>between</i><span> the cherubims, thou </span><i>art</i><span> the God, </span><i>even</i><span> thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they </span><i>were</i><span> no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou </span><i>art</i><span> the LORD, </span><i>even</i><span> thou only.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>This </span><i>is</i><span> the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, </span><i>and</i><span> laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted </span><i>thy</i><span> voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? </span><i>even</i><span> against the Holy One of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, </span><i>and</i><span> the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, </span><i>and</i><span> the forest of his Carmel.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</span>
</div>

<div>[26]
<span>Hast thou not heard long ago, </span><i>how</i><span> I have done it; </span><i>and</i><span> of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities </span><i>into</i><span> ruinous heaps.</span>
</div>

<div>[27]
<span>Therefore their inhabitants </span><i>were</i><span> of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were </span><i>as</i><span> the grass of the field, and </span><i>as</i><span> the green herb, </span><i>as</i><span> the grass on the housetops, and </span><i>as corn</i><span> blasted before it be grown up.</span>
</div>

<div>[28]
<span>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[29]
<span>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</span>
</div>

<div>[30]
<span>And this </span><i>shall be</i><span> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat </span><i>this</i><span> year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[31]
<span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</span>
</div>

<div>[32]
<span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</span>
</div>

<div>[33]
<span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</span>
</div>

<div>[34]
<span>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[35]
<span>For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</span>
</div>

<div>[36]
<span>Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they </span><i>were</i><span> all dead corpses.</span>
</div>

<div>[37]
<span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span>
</div>

<div>[38]
<span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done </span><i>that which is</i><span> good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And this </span><i>shall be</i><span> a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>I said, I shall not see the LORD, </span><i>even</i><span> the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day </span><i>even</i><span> to night wilt thou make an end of me.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>I reckoned till morning, </span><i>that</i><span>, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day </span><i>even</i><span> to night wilt thou make an end of me.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Like a crane </span><i>or</i><span> a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail </span><i>with looking</i><span> upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done </span><i>it</i><span>: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>O Lord, by these </span><i>things men</i><span> live, and in all these </span><i>things is</i><span> the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul </span><i>delivered it</i><span> from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>For the grave cannot praise thee, death can </span><i>not</i><span> celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I </span><i>do</i><span> this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>The LORD </span><i>was ready</i><span> to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay </span><i>it</i><span> for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Hezekiah also had said, What </span><i>is</i><span> the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</span>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, </span><i>even</i><span> from Babylon.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that </span><i>is</i><span> in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:</span>

<div>[6]
<span>Behold, the days come, that all that </span><i>is</i><span> in thine house, and </span><i>that</i><span> which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</span>

<span>Who raised up the righteous </span><i>man</i><span> from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made </span><i>him</i><span> rule over kings? he gave </span><i>them</i><span> as the dust to his sword, </span><i>and</i><span> as driven stubble to his bow.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>He pursued them, </span><i>and</i><span> passed safely; </span><i>even</i><span> by the way </span><i>that</i><span> he had not gone with his feet.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Who hath wrought and done </span><i>it</i><span>, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I </span><i>am</i><span> he.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>The isles saw </span><i>it</i><span>, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>They helped every one his neighbour; and </span><i>every one</i><span> said to his brother, Be of good courage.</span>

<span>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, </span><i>and</i><span> he that smootheth </span><i>with</i><span> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It </span><i>is</i><span> ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, </span><i>that</i><span> it should not be moved.</span>

<span>But thou, Israel, </span><i>art</i><span> my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.</span>

<i>Thou</i><span> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.</span>

<div>[10]
<span>Fear thou not; for I </span><i>am</i><span> with thee: be not dismayed; for I </span><i>am</i><span> thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, </span><i>even</i><span> them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, </span><i>and</i><span> ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</span>

<div>[15]
<span>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat </span><i>them</i><span> small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.</span>

<div>[16]
<span>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, </span><i>and</i><span> shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<i>When</i><span> the poor and needy seek water, and </span><i>there is</i><span> none, </span><i>and</i><span> their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, </span><i>and</i><span> the pine, and the box tree together:</span>

</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye </span><i>are</i><span> gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold </span><i>it</i><span> together.</span>

<div>[10]
<span>Ye </span><i>are</i><span> my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I </span><i>am</i><span> he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</span>

<span>Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.</span>

<span>Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Surely God </span><i>is</i><span> in thee; and </span><i>there is</i><span> none else, </span><i>there is</i><span> no God.</span>

<div>[15]

<div>[19]
<span>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span>

<div>[20]
<span>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye </span><i>that are</i><span> escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god </span><i>that</i><span> cannot save.</span>

<div>[21]
<span>Tell ye, and bring </span><i>them</i><span> near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? </span><i>who</i><span> hath told it from that time? </span><i>have</i><span> not I the LORD? and </span><i>there is</i><span> no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; </span><i>there is</i><span> none beside me.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I </span><i>am</i><span> God, and </span><i>there is</i><span> none else.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth </span><i>in</i><span> righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Surely, shall </span><i>one</i><span> say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: </span><i>even</i><span> to him shall </span><i>men</i><span> come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.</span>

<span>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</span>

<div>[11]
<span>He shall see of the travail of his soul, </span><i>and</i><span> shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</span>

<span>Therefore will I divide him </span><i>a portion</i><span> with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</span>

<div>[21]
<span>And I will also take of them for priests </span><i>and</i><span> for Levites, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>And it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</span>
