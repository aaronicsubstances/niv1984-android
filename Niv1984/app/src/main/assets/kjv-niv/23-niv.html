<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness-- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>"The multitude of your sacrifices-- what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations-- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>"Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her-- but now murderers!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[1] <span>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[2] <span>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[3] <span>Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[4] <span>He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[5] <span>Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[6] <span>You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[7] <span>Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[8] <span>Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[9] <span>So man will be brought low and mankind humbled-- do not forgive them. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[2] <span>Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-749'>[2] <span>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-750'>[3] <span>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-752'>[5] <span>You say you have strategy and military strength--but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?</span></div>
