</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-28-2'>"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: `I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-28-3'>Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the LORD's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-28-4'>I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_1">1</a>]</sup> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD, `for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-28-5'>Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-28-6'>He said, "Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-28-7'>Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-28-8'>From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-28-9'>But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the LORD only if his prediction comes true."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-28-10'>Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-28-11'>and he said before all the people, "This is what the LORD says: `In the same way will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.'" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-28-12'>Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-28-13'>"Go and tell Hananiah, `This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-28-14'>This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-28-15'>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-28-16'>Therefore, this is what the LORD says: `I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.'"
</li></ol>

<h3>Jeremiah 29</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-29-1'>This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-29-8'>Yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-29-9'>They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them," declares the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-29-10'>This is what the LORD says: "When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-29-11'>For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-29-19'>For they have not listened to my words," declares the LORD, "words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either," declares the LORD.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-29-22'>Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: `The LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.'

<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-29-24'>Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,

<h3>Jeremiah 32</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-32-1'>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-32-2'>The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-32-3'>Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, "Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, `This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-32-4'>Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hands of the Babylonians 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_1">1</a>]</sup> but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-32-5'>He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-32-6'>Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-32-7'>Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, `Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-32-8'>"Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, `Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.' "I knew that this was the word of the LORD;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-32-9'>so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_2">2</a>]</sup> of silver.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-32-10'>I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-32-11'>I took the deed of purchase--the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-32-12'>and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-32-13'>"In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-32-14'>`This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-32-15'>For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-32-16'>"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-32-17'>"Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-32-18'>You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty,

<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-32-20'>You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, both in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-32-21'>You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-32-22'>You gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-32-23'>They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster upon them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-32-24'>"See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see.

<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-32-25'>And though the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, you, O Sovereign LORD, say to me, `Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.'"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-32-29'>The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-32-30'>"The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but provoke me with what their hands have made, declares the LORD.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-32-32'>The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done--they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-32-33'>They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-32-36'>"You are saying about this city, `By the sword, famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon'; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:

<h3>Jeremiah 36</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-36-1'>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-36-2'>"Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-36-3'>Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-36-4'>So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-36-5'>Then Jeremiah told Baruch, "I am restricted; I cannot go to the LORD's temple.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-36-6'>So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-36-7'>Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-36-8'>Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-36-9'>In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-36-10'>From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-36-11'>When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-36-12'>he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-36-13'>After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-36-14'>all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-36-15'>They said to him, "Sit down, please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-36-16'>When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-36-17'>Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-36-18'>"Yes," Baruch replied, "he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-36-19'>Then the officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-36-20'>After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-36-21'>The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-36-22'>It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-36-23'>Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-36-24'>The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-36-25'>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-36-26'>Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-36-27'>After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-36-28'>"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-36-29'>Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, `This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, "Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-36-30'>Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-36-31'>I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-36-32'>So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.

<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-37-4'>Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.

</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-37-11'>After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-37-12'>Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-37-13'>But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-37-14'>"That's not true!" Jeremiah said. "I am not deserting to the Babylonians." But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-37-15'>They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-37-16'>Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-37-17'>Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, "Is there any word from the LORD?" "Yes," Jeremiah replied, "you will be handed over to the king of Babylon."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-37-18'>Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, that you have put me in prison?

<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-37-21'>King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.

He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-40-2'>When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, "The LORD your God decreed this disaster for this place.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-40-3'>And now the LORD has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the LORD and did not obey him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-40-4'>But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don't come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-40-5'>However, before Jeremiah turned to go, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_458921759_1">1</a>]</sup> Nebuzaradan added, "Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please." Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-40-6'>So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-40-7'>When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-40-8'>they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_458921759_2">2</a>]</sup> the son of the Maacathite, and their men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-40-9'>Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_458921759_3">3</a>]</sup> " he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-40-10'>I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-40-11'>When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-40-12'>they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-40-13'>Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-40-14'>and said to him, "Don't you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-40-15'>Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, "Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-40-16'>But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true."

<h3>Jeremiah 41</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-41-1'>In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king's officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-41-2'>Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-41-3'>Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-41-4'>The day after Gedaliah's assassination, before anyone knew about it,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-41-5'>eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-41-6'>Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-41-7'>When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-41-8'>But ten of them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us! We have wheat and barley, oil and honey, hidden in a field." So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-41-9'>Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-41-10'>Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah--the king's daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-41-11'>When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-41-12'>they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-41-13'>When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-41-14'>All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-41-15'>But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-41-16'>Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the survivors from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam: the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had brought from Gibeon.
