<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears </span><i>are</i><span> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort </span><i>her</i><span>: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she </span><i>is</i><span> in bitterness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, </span><i>and</i><span> did mock at her sabbaths.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed." </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Her filthiness </span><i>is</i><span> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary-- those you had forbidden to enter your assembly. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen </span><i>that</i><span> the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command </span><i>that</i><span> they should not enter into thy congregation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised." </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger? </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <i>Is it</i><span> nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted </span><i>me</i><span> in the day of his fierce anger.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>"From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate </span><i>and</i><span> faint all the day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>"My sins have been bound into a yoke </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ; by his hands they were woven together.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, </span><i>and</i><span> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into </span><i>their</i><span> hands, </span><i>from whom</i><span> I am not able to rise up.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> crush my young men.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty </span><i>men</i><span> in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, </span><i>as</i><span> in a winepress.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>"This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed." </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>For these </span><i>things</i><span> I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, </span><i>and there is</i><span> none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, </span><i>that</i><span> his adversaries </span><i>should be</i><span> round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>"The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>"I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>I called for my lovers, </span><i>but</i><span> they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>"See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>They have heard that I sigh: </span><i>there is</i><span> none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done </span><i>it</i><span>: thou wilt bring the day </span><i>that</i><span> thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</span></div></div>
