<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They have heard that I sigh: </span><i>there is</i><span> none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done </span><i>it</i><span>: thou wilt bring the day </span><i>that</i><span> thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs </span><i>are</i><span> many, and my heart </span><i>is</i><span> faint.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>How is the gold become dim! </span><i>how</i><span> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people </span><i>is become</i><span> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, </span><i>and</i><span> no man breaketh </span><i>it</i><span> unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing </span><i>was</i><span> of sapphire:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <i>They that be</i><span> slain with the sword are better than </span><i>they that be</i><span> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for </span><i>want of</i><span> the fruits of the field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For the sins of her prophets, </span><i>and</i><span> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>They have wandered </span><i>as</i><span> blind </span><i>men</i><span> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; </span><i>it is</i><span> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn </span><i>there</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation </span><i>that</i><span> could not save </span><i>us</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</span></div>
