<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>How doth the city sit solitary, </span><i>that was</i><span> full of people! </span><i>how</i><span> is she become as a widow! she </span><i>that was</i><span> great among the nations, </span><i>and</i><span> princess among the provinces, </span><i>how</i><span> is she become tributary!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears </span><i>are</i><span> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort </span><i>her</i><span>: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she </span><i>is</i><span> in bitterness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts </span><i>that</i><span> find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, </span><i>and</i><span> did mock at her sabbaths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Her filthiness </span><i>is</i><span> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified </span><i>himself</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen </span><i>that</i><span> the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command </span><i>that</i><span> they should not enter into thy congregation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <i>Is it</i><span> nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted </span><i>me</i><span> in the day of his fierce anger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate </span><i>and</i><span> faint all the day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, </span><i>and</i><span> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into </span><i>their</i><span> hands, </span><i>from whom</i><span> I am not able to rise up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty </span><i>men</i><span> in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, </span><i>as</i><span> in a winepress.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>For these </span><i>things</i><span> I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, </span><i>and there is</i><span> none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, </span><i>that</i><span> his adversaries </span><i>should be</i><span> round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>I called for my lovers, </span><i>but</i><span> they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Behold, O LORD; for I </span><i>am</i><span> in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home </span><i>there is</i><span> as death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>They have heard that I sigh: </span><i>there is</i><span> none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done </span><i>it</i><span>: thou wilt bring the day </span><i>that</i><span> thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs </span><i>are</i><span> many, and my heart </span><i>is</i><span> faint.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[2] <span>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought </span><i>them</i><span> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[3] <span>He hath cut off in </span><i>his</i><span> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, </span><i>which</i><span> devoureth round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[4] <span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all </span><i>that were</i><span> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[5] <span>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[6] <span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as </span><i>if it were of</i><span> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[7] <span>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[8] <span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[9] <span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes </span><i>are</i><span> among the Gentiles: the law </span><i>is</i><span> no </span><i>more</i><span>; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[10] <span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, </span><i>and</i><span> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[11] <span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[14] <span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[15] <span>All that pass by clap </span><i>their</i><span> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, </span><i>saying, Is</i><span> this the city that </span><i>men</i><span> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[16] <span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed </span><i>her</i><span> up: certainly this </span><i>is</i><span> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[17] <span>The LORD hath done </span><i>that</i><span> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused </span><i>thine</i><span> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[18] <span>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[19] <span>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[20] <span>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, </span><i>and</i><span> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[21] <span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain </span><i>them</i><span> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, </span><i>and</i><span> not pitied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[22] <span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-132'>[15] <span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; </span><i>it is</i><span> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn </span><i>there</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-133'>[16] <span>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-134'>[17] <span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation </span><i>that</i><span> could not save </span><i>us</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-135'>[18] <span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-136'>[19] <span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-137'>[20] <span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-138'>[21] <span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'>[22] <span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</span></div>
