<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1]  <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave. </span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies. </span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress. </span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish. </span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe. </span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer. </span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction. </span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away. </span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed." </span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary-- those you had forbidden to enter your assembly. </span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised." </span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger? </span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>"From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long. </span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>"My sins have been bound into a yoke </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ; by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand. </span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>"The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah. </span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>"This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed." </span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them. </span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>"The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile. </span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>"I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive. </span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>"See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death. </span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>"People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me. </span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>"Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint." </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-23'>[1]  <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. </span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[2] <span>Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor. </span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[3] <span>In fierce anger he has cut off every horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it. </span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[4] <span>Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion. </span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[5] <span>The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah. </span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[6] <span>He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest. </span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[7] <span>The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast. </span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[8] <span>The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away. </span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[9] <span>Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD. </span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[10] <span>The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground. </span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[11] <span>My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within, my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city. </span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[12] <span>They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms. </span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[13] <span>What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you? </span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[14] <span>The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading. </span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[15] <span>All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?" </span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[16] <span>All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it." </span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[17] <span>The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of your foes. </span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[18] <span>The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest. </span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[19] <span>Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street. </span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[20] <span>"Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord? </span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[21] <span>"Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity. </span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[22] <span>"As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed." </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-45'>[1]  <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[2] <span>He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[3] <span>indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long. </span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[4] <span>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[5] <span>He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[6] <span>He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead. </span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[7] <span>He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[8] <span>Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[9] <span>He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked. </span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[10] <span>Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[11] <span>he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[12] <span>He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows. </span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[13] <span>He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[14] <span>I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[15] <span>He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall. </span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[16] <span>He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[17] <span>I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[18] <span>So I say, "My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD." </span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[19] <span>I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[20] <span>I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[21] <span>Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: </span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[22] <span>Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[23] <span>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[24] <span>I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him." </span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[25] <span>The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[26] <span>it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[27] <span>It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young. </span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[28] <span>Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[29] <span>Let him bury his face in the dust-- there may yet be hope.</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[30] <span>Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace. </span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[31] <span>For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[32] <span>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[33] <span>For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men. </span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[34] <span>To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[35] <span>to deny a man his rights before the Most High,</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[36] <span>to deprive a man of justice-- would not the Lord see such things? </span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[37] <span>Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[38] <span>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[39] <span>Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins? </span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[40] <span>Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[41] <span>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[42] <span>"We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven. </span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[43] <span>"You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[44] <span>You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[45] <span>You have made us scum and refuse among the nations. </span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[46] <span>"All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[47] <span>We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction."</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[48] <span>Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed. </span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[49] <span>My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[50] <span>until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[51] <span>What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city. </span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[52] <span>Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[53] <span>They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[54] <span>the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off. </span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[55] <span>I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[56] <span>You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief."</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[57] <span>You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear." </span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[58] <span>O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[59] <span>You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[60] <span>You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me. </span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[61] <span>O LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me--</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[62] <span>what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[63] <span>Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs. </span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[64] <span>Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[65] <span>Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[66] <span>Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD. </span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[13] <span>Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[14] <span>The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[15] <span>Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[16] <span>The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[17] <span>Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[18] <span>for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it. </span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[19] <span>You, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[20] <span>Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[21] <span>Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[22] <span>unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure. </span></div>
