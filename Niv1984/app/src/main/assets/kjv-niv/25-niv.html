<h3>Lamentations 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'><sup>[<a href="#footnote_487482367_1">1</a>]</sup> How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she is in bitter anguish.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. "Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary-- those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look, O LORD, and consider, for I am despised."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>"From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>"My sins have been bound into a yoke 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_487482367_2">2</a>]</sup> ; by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>"The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_487482367_3">3</a>]</sup> crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>"This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>"The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>"I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>"See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>"People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>"Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint."

<h3>Lamentations 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup> How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup> ! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'>In fierce anger he has cut off every horn 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_3">3</a>]</sup> of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'>The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'>He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'>The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>The LORD determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'>Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'>The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'>My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within, my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'>They say to their mothers, "Where is bread and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers' arms.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'>The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'>All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'>All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, "We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'>The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-2-18'>The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'>Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-2-20'>"Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-2-21'>"Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-2-22'>"As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-3-4'>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.

<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-3-5'>He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-3-6'>He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-3-8'>Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-3-9'>He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-3-11'>he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-3-12'>He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.

<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-3-13'>He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-3-14'>I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.
