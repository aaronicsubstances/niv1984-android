</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'><b>(NIV)</b> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'><b>(NIV)</b> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.
