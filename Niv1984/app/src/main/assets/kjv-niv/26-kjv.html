<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Also out of the midst thereof </span><i>came</i><span> the likeness of four living creatures. And this </span><i>was</i><span> their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Thus </span><i>were</i><span> their faces: and their wings </span><i>were</i><span> stretched upward; two </span><i>wings</i><span> of every one </span><i>were</i><span> joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature </span><i>was</i><span> as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And under the firmament </span><i>were</i><span> their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And there was a voice from the firmament that </span><i>was</i><span> over their heads, when they stood, </span><i>and</i><span> had let down their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And above the firmament that </span><i>was</i><span> over their heads </span><i>was</i><span> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne </span><i>was</i><span> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so </span><i>was</i><span> the appearance of the brightness round about.
