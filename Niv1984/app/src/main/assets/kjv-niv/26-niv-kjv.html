<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they </span><i>are</i><span> a rebellious house.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will listen let him listen, and whoever will refuse let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.</span></div>
