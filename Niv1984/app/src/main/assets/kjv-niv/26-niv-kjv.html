<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>On the fifth of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> There the hand of the LORD was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>but each of them had four faces and four wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> as the creatures went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>In the fifth </span><i>day</i><span> of the month, which </span><i>was</i><span> the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness </span><i>was</i><span> about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Also out of the midst thereof </span><i>came</i><span> the likeness of four living creatures. And this </span><i>was</i><span> their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And their feet </span><i>were</i><span> straight feet; and the sole of their feet </span><i>was</i><span> like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And </span><i>they had</i><span> the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Their wings </span><i>were</i><span> joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Thus </span><i>were</i><span> their faces: and their wings </span><i>were</i><span> stretched upward; two </span><i>wings</i><span> of every one </span><i>were</i><span> joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; </span><i>and</i><span> they turned not when they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance </span><i>was</i><span> like burning coals of fire, </span><i>and</i><span> like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>The appearance of the wheels and their work </span><i>was</i><span> like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work </span><i>was</i><span> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>When they went, they went upon their four sides: </span><i>and</i><span> they turned not when they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings </span><i>were</i><span> full of eyes round about them four.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither </span><i>was their</i><span> spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature </span><i>was</i><span> in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>When those went, </span><i>these</i><span> went; and when those stood, </span><i>these</i><span> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature </span><i>was</i><span> in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature </span><i>was</i><span> as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>And under the firmament </span><i>were</i><span> their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>And there was a voice from the firmament that </span><i>was</i><span> over their heads, when they stood, </span><i>and</i><span> had let down their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>And above the firmament that </span><i>was</i><span> over their heads </span><i>was</i><span> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne </span><i>was</i><span> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so </span><i>was</i><span> the appearance of the brightness round about. This </span><i>was</i><span> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw </span><i>it</i><span>, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[21] <span>But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[22] <span>The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[23] <span>So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[24] <span>Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-112'>[2] <span>Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-113'>[3] <span>And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, </span><i>even</i><span> I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-114'>[4] <span>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain </span><i>men</i><span> before your idols.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-122'>[12] <span>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[1] <span>In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came upon me there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[2] <span>I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[3] <span>He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[4] <span>And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[5] <span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[6] <span>And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing--the utterly detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[7] <span>Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[8] <span>He said to me, "Son of man, now dig into the wall." So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[9] <span>And he said to me, "Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[10] <span>So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[11] <span>In front of them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[12] <span>He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, `The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[13] <span>Again, he said, "You will see them doing things that are even more detestable."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[14] <span>Then he brought me to the entrance to the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning for Tammuz.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[15] <span>He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[16] <span>He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'>[17] <span>He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the house of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually provoke me to anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'>[18] <span>Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-332'>[3] <span>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity </span><i>is</i><span> of the land of Canaan; thy father </span><i>was</i><span> an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-333'>[4] <span>And </span><i>as for</i><span> thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple </span><i>thee</i><span>; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-334'>[5] <span>None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-335'>[6] <span>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee </span><i>when thou wast</i><span> in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee </span><i>when thou wast</i><span> in thy blood, Live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-336'>[7] <span>I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: </span><i>thy</i><span> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou </span><i>wast</i><span> naked and bare.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'>[8] <span>Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time </span><i>was</i><span> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-338'>[9] <span>Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-339'>[10] <span>I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-340'>[11] <span>I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-346'>[17] <span>Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-357'>[28] <span>Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-358'>[29] <span>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-364'>[35] <span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-365'>[36] <span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-366'>[37] <span>Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all </span><i>them</i><span> that thou hast loved, with all </span><i>them</i><span> that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-367'>[38] <span>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-368'>[39] <span>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-370'>[41] <span>And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'>[2] <span>"What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: "`The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'>[3] <span>"As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'>[4] <span>For every living soul belongs to me, the father as well as the son--both alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'>[5] <span>"Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'>[6] <span>He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife or lie with a woman during her period.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'>[7] <span>He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'>[8] <span>He does not lend at usury or take excessive interest. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-429'>[9] <span>He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-430'>[10] <span>"Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'>[11] <span>(though the father has done none of them): "He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor's wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'>[12] <span>He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'>[13] <span>He lends at usury and takes excessive interest. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'>[14] <span>"But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'>[15] <span>"He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'>[16] <span>He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.</span></div>

He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'>[18] <span>But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'>[19] <span>"Yet you ask, `Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?' Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440'>[20] <span>The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441'>[21] <span>"But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[24] <span>"But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked man does, will he live? None of the righteous things he has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has committed, he will die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[25] <span>"Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear, O house of Israel: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'>[26] <span>If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it; because of the sin he has committed he will die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[27] <span>But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[28] <span>Because he considers all the offenses he has committed and turns away from them, he will surely live; he will not die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[29] <span>Yet the house of Israel says, `The way of the Lord is not just.' Are my ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[30] <span>"Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[31] <span>Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[32] <span>For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live! </span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-470'>Chapter 20</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[1] <span>In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down in front of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'>[2] <span>Then the word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[3] <span>"Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-474'>[4] <span>"Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their fathers</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[5] <span>and say to them: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of the house of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, "I am the LORD your God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-476'>[6] <span>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-477'>[7] <span>And I said to them, "Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'>[8] <span>"`But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[9] <span>But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations they lived among and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites by bringing them out of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[10] <span>Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[11] <span>I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'>[12] <span>Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the LORD made them holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'>[13] <span>"`Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the desert. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws--although the man who obeys them will live by them--and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'>[14] <span>But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-485'>[15] <span>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the desert that I would not bring them into the land I had given them--a land flowing with milk and honey, most beautiful of all lands--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-486'>[16] <span>because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'>[17] <span>Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-488'>[18] <span>I said to their children in the desert, "Do not follow the statutes of your fathers or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'>[19] <span>I am the LORD your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[20] <span>Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'>[21] <span>"`But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws--although the man who obeys them will live by them--and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the desert.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'>[22] <span>But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-493'>[23] <span>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the desert that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-494'>[24] <span>because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes [lusted] after their fathers' idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-495'>[25] <span>I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-496'>[26] <span>I let them become defiled through their gifts--the sacrifice of every firstborn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> --that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-497'>[27] <span>"Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In this also your fathers blasphemed me by forsaking me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-498'>[28] <span>When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings that provoked me to anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-499'>[29] <span>Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?'" (It is called Bamah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-2" id="niv-verse-20-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to this day.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'>[30] <span>"Therefore say to the house of Israel: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will you defile yourselves the way your fathers did and lust after their vile images?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'>[31] <span>When you offer your gifts--the sacrifice of your sons in </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-3" id="niv-verse-20-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the fire--you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, O house of Israel? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will not let you inquire of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'>[32] <span>"`You say, "We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone." But what you have in mind will never happen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'>[33] <span>As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will rule over you with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'>[34] <span>I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered--with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'>[35] <span>I will bring you into the desert of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'>[36] <span>As I judged your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[37] <span>I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'>[38] <span>I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[39] <span>"`As for you, O house of Israel, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[40] <span>For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD, there in the land the entire house of Israel will serve me, and there I will accept them.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'>[41] <span>I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will show myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'>[42] <span>Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'>[43] <span>There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'>[44] <span>You will know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake and not according to your evil ways and your corrupt practices, O house of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'>[45] <span>The word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'>[46] <span>"Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest of the southland.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-479'>[9] <span>But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they </span><i>were</i><span>, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-480'>[10] <span>Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-588'>Chapter 23</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'>[2] <span>"Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'>[3] <span>They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'>[4] <span>The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'>[5] <span>"Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians--warriors</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'>[6] <span>clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'>[7] <span>She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'>[8] <span>She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'>[9] <span>"Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'>[10] <span>They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'>[11] <span>"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-600'>[12] <span>She too lusted after the Assyrians--governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-601'>[13] <span>I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'>[14] <span>"But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">a</a>]</sup><span> portrayed in red,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'>[15] <span>with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'>[16] <span>As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'>[17] <span>Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'>[18] <span>When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'>[19] <span>Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'>[20] <span>There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'>[21] <span>So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-3" id="niv-verse-23-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-610'>[22] <span>"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-611'>[23] <span>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'>[24] <span>They will come against you with weapons, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-4" id="niv-verse-23-4">d</a>]</sup><span> chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'>[25] <span>I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'>[26] <span>They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'>[27] <span>So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'>[28] <span>"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'>[29] <span>They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-618'>[30] <span>have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'>[31] <span>You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'>[32] <span>"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'>[33] <span>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'>[34] <span>You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[35] <span>"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and thrust me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[36] <span>The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[37] <span>for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-5" id="niv-verse-23-5">e</a>]</sup><span> as food for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[38] <span>They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'>[39] <span>On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'>[40] <span>"They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes and put on your jewelry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[41] <span>You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[42] <span>"The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; Sabeans </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-6" id="niv-verse-23-6">f</a>]</sup><span> were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'>[43] <span>Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, `Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[44] <span>And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[45] <span>But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[46] <span>"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'>[47] <span>The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[48] <span>"So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[49] <span>You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD."</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-588'>Chapter 23</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-589'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-590'>[2] <span>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-591'>[3] <span>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-592'>[4] <span>And the names of them </span><i>were</i><span> Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus </span><i>were</i><span> their names; Samaria </span><i>is</i><span> Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-593'>[5] <span>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians </span><i>her</i><span> neighbours,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-594'>[6] <i>Which were</i><span> clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-595'>[7] <span>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them </span><i>that were</i><span> the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-596'>[8] <span>Neither left she her whoredoms </span><i>brought</i><span> from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-597'>[9] <span>Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-598'>[10] <span>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-599'>[11] <span>And when her sister Aholibah saw </span><i>this</i><span>, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in </span><i>her</i><span> whoredoms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-600'>[12] <span>She doted upon the Assyrians </span><i>her</i><span> neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-601'>[13] <span>Then I saw that she was defiled, </span><i>that</i><span> they </span><i>took</i><span> both one way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-602'>[14] <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-603'>[15] <span>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-604'>[16] <span>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-605'>[17] <span>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-606'>[18] <span>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-607'>[19] <span>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-608'>[20] <span>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh </span><i>is as</i><span> the flesh of asses, and whose issue </span><i>is like</i><span> the issue of horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-609'>[21] <span>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-610'>[22] <span>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-611'>[23] <span>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, </span><i>and</i><span> all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-612'>[24] <span>And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, </span><i>which</i><span> shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-613'>[25] <span>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-614'>[26] <span>They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-615'>[27] <span>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom </span><i>brought</i><span> from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-616'>[28] <span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand </span><i>of them</i><span> whom thou hatest, into the hand </span><i>of them</i><span> from whom thy mind is alienated:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-617'>[29] <span>And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-618'>[30] <span>I will do these </span><i>things</i><span> unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, </span><i>and</i><span> because thou art polluted with their idols.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-619'>[31] <span>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-620'>[32] <span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-621'>[33] <span>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-622'>[34] <span>Thou shalt even drink it and suck </span><i>it</i><span> out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken </span><i>it</i><span>, saith the Lord GOD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-623'>[35] <span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-624'>[36] <span>The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-625'>[37] <span>That they have committed adultery, and blood </span><i>is</i><span> in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through </span><i>the fire</i><span>, to devour </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-626'>[38] <span>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-627'>[39] <span>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-628'>[40] <span>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger </span><i>was</i><span> sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-629'>[41] <span>And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-630'>[42] <span>And a voice of a multitude being at ease </span><i>was</i><span> with her: and with the men of the common sort </span><i>were</i><span> brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-631'>[43] <span>Then said I unto </span><i>her that was</i><span> old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she </span><i>with them</i><span>?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-632'>[44] <span>Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-633'>[45] <span>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they </span><i>are</i><span> adulteresses, and blood </span><i>is</i><span> in their hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-634'>[46] <span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-635'>[47] <span>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-636'>[48] <span>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-637'>[49] <span>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I </span><i>am</i><span> the Lord GOD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'>[1] <span>In the eleventh year, in the third month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'>[2] <span>"Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: "`Who can be compared with you in majesty?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'>[3] <span>Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'>[4] <span>The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'>[5] <span>So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'>[6] <span>All the birds of the air nested in its boughs, all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'>[7] <span>It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'>[8] <span>The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the pine trees equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches-- no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'>[9] <span>I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'>[10] <span>"`Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because it towered on high, lifting its top above the thick foliage, and because it was proud of its height,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'>[11] <span>I handed it over to the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'>[12] <span>and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[13] <span>All the birds of the air settled on the fallen tree, and all the beasts of the field were among its branches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'>[14] <span>Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortal men, with those who go down to the pit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'>[15] <span>"`This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day it was brought down to the grave </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-31-1" id="niv-verse-31-1">a</a>]</sup><span> I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'>[16] <span>I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the grave with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the trees that were well-watered, were consoled in the earth below.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'>[17] <span>Those who lived in its shade, its allies among the nations, had also gone down to the grave with it, joining those killed by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'>[18] <span>"`Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883'>[2] <span>"Son of man, speak to your countrymen and say to them: `When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-884'>[3] <span>and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-885'>[4] <span>then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the sword comes and takes his life, his blood will be on his own head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-886'>[5] <span>Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had taken warning, he would have saved himself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888'>[7] <span>"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-889'>[8] <span>When I say to the wicked, `O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways, that wicked man will die for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-33-1" id="niv-verse-33-1">a</a>]</sup><span> his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-890'>[9] <span>But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will have saved yourself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-908'>[27] <span>"Say this to them: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909'>[28] <span>I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-917'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-918'>[2] <span>"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919'>[3] <span>You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'>[4] <span>You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-921'>[5] <span>So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-922'>[6] <span>My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-926'>[10] <span>This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-927'>[11] <span>"`For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-928'>[12] <span>As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-929'>[13] <span>I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1093'>[1] <span>In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city--on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he took me there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1094'>[2] <span>In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1095'>[3] <span>He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1096'>[4] <span>The man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1097'>[5] <span>I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1098'>[6] <span>Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-3" id="niv-verse-40-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1099'>[7] <span>The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1100'>[8] <span>Then he measured the portico of the gateway;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1101'>[9] <span>it </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-4" id="niv-verse-40-4">d</a>]</sup><span> was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1102'>[10] <span>Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1103'>[11] <span>Then he measured the width of the entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1104'>[12] <span>In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1105'>[13] <span>Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1106'>[14] <span>He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway--sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-5" id="niv-verse-40-5">e</a>]</sup><span> facing the courtyard. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-40-6" id="niv-verse-40-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1107'>[15] <span>The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1108'>[16] <span>The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward.
