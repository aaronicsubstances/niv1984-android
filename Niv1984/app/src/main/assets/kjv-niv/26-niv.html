<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>On the fifth of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> There the hand of the LORD was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>but each of them had four faces and four wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> as the creatures went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And whether they listen or fail to listen--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he said to me, "Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound--May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days--overwhelmed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>When I say to a wicked man, `You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing--the utterly detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>In front of them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man?

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed.</span></div>
