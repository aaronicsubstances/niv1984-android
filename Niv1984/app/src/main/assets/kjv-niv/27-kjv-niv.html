<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.

<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</i>
