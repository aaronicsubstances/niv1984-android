<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and put in the treasure house of his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>"Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring </span><i>certain</i><span> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Children in whom </span><i>was</i><span> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as </span><i>had</i><span> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel </span><i>the name</i><span> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which </span><i>are</i><span> of your sort? then shall ye make </span><i>me</i><span> endanger my head to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And in all matters of wisdom </span><i>and</i><span> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians </span><i>and</i><span> astrologers that </span><i>were</i><span> in all his realm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And Daniel continued </span><i>even</i><span> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-24'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[1] <span>In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[2] <span>So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[3] <span>he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[4] <span>Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[5] <span>The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[6] <span>But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[7] <span>Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[8] <span>Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[9] <span>If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[10] <span>The astrologers answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[11] <span>What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[12] <span>This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[13] <span>So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[14] <span>When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[15] <span>He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[16] <span>At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[17] <span>Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[18] <span>He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[19] <span>During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[20] <span>and said: "Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[21] <span>He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[22] <span>He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[23] <span>I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[24] <span>Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[25] <span>Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[26] <span>The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[27] <span>Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[28] <span>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[29] <span>"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[30] <span>As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[31] <span>"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue--an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[32] <span>The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[33] <span>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[34] <span>While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[35] <span>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[36] <span>"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[37] <span>You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[38] <span>in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[39] <span>"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[40] <span>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron--for iron breaks and smashes everything--and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[41] <span>Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[42] <span>As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[43] <span>And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[44] <span>"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[45] <span>This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands--a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[46] <span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[47] <span>The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[48] <span>Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[49] <span>Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[1] <span>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[2] <span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[11] <span>And </span><i>it is</i><span> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[12] <span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise </span><i>men</i><span> of Babylon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[13] <span>And the decree went forth that the wise </span><i>men</i><span> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[14] <span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise </span><i>men</i><span> of Babylon:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[15] <span>He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why </span><i>is</i><span> the decree </span><i>so</i><span> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[16] <span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[17] <span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[18] <span>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise </span><i>men</i><span> of Babylon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[48] <span>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise </span><i>men</i><span> of Babylon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[2] <span>He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[3] <span>So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[4] <span>Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[5] <span>As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[7] <span>Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[8] <span>At this time some astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> came forward and denounced the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[9] <span>They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[10] <span>You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[12] <span>But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon--Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego--who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[13] <span>Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[14] <span>and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[15] <span>Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[16] <span>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[17] <span>If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[18] <span>But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[19] <span>Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[20] <span>and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[21] <span>So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[22] <span>The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[23] <span>and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[24] <span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, "Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?" They replied, "Certainly, O king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[25] <span>He said, "Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[26] <span>Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[27] <span>and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[28] <span>Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[29] <span>Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[30] <span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'>[19] <span>Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[20] <span>The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[24] <span>"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[26] <span>The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[28] <span>All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[33] <span>Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[34] <span>At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[2] <span>While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[4] <span>As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[5] <span>Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[6] <span>His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'>[7] <span>The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[8] <span>Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[9] <span>So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[10] <span>The queen, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[11] <span>There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your father--your father the king, I say--appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[12] <span>This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[13] <span>So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[14] <span>I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[17] <span>Then Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[18] <span>"O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[19] <span>Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[20] <span>But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[21] <span>He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[22] <span>"But you his son, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-4" id="niv-verse-5-4">d</a>]</sup><span> O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[23] <span>Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[24] <span>Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[25] <span>"This is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-5" id="niv-verse-5-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-179'>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'>[1] <span>It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'>[2] <span>with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'>[3] <span>Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'>[4] <span>At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'>[5] <span>Finally these men said, "We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'>[6] <span>So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said: "O King Darius, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'>[7] <span>The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the lions' den.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'>[8] <span>Now, O king, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'>[9] <span>So King Darius put the decree in writing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'>[10] <span>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'>[11] <span>Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'>[12] <span>So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: "Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "The decree stands--in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[13] <span>Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[14] <span>When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[15] <span>Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him, "Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'>[16] <span>So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-196'>[17] <span>A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation might not be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-197'>[18] <span>Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-198'>[19] <span>At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'>[20] <span>When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'>[21] <span>Daniel answered, "O king, live forever!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-201'>[22] <span>My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-202'>[23] <span>The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-203'>[24] <span>At the king's command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-204'>[25] <span>Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language throughout the land: "May you prosper greatly! </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-205'>[26] <span>"I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. "For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'>[27] <span>He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-187'>[8] <span>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-190'>[11] <span>Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-192'>[13] <span>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which </span><i>is</i><span> of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-193'>[14] <span>Then the king, when he heard </span><i>these</i><span> words, was sore displeased with himself, and set </span><i>his</i><span> heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-194'>[15] <span>Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians </span><i>is</i><span>, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-195'>[16] <span>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast </span><i>him</i><span> into the den of lions. </span><i>Now</i><span> the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-196'>[17] <span>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'>[1] <span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-211'>[2] <span>Daniel said: "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-212'>[3] <span>Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-213'>[4] <span>"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-214'>[5] <span>"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, `Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'>[6] <span>"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-216'>[7] <span>"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast--terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'>[8] <span>"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-218'>[9] <span>"As I looked, "thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-219'>[10] <span>A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-220'>[11] <span>"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'>[12] <span>(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'>[13] <span>"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'>[14] <span>He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-224'>[15] <span>"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'>[16] <span>I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. "So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'>[17] <span>`The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'>[18] <span>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever--yes, for ever and ever.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'>[19] <span>"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws--the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'>[20] <span>I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell--the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'>[21] <span>As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'>[22] <span>until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'>[23] <span>"He gave me this explanation: `The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-210'>[1] <span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, </span><i>and</i><span> told the sum of the matters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-211'>[2] <span>Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-212'>[3] <span>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-213'>[4] <span>The first </span><i>was</i><span> like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-214'>[5] <span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and </span><i>it had</i><span> three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-215'>[6] <span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-216'>[7] <span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it </span><i>was</i><span> diverse from all the beasts that </span><i>were</i><span> before it; and it had ten horns.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-217'>[8] <span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn </span><i>were</i><span> eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-218'>[9] <span>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment </span><i>was</i><span> white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne </span><i>was like</i><span> the fiery flame, </span><i>and</i><span> his wheels </span><i>as</i><span> burning fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-219'>[10] <span>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-220'>[11] <span>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld </span><i>even</i><span> till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-221'>[12] <span>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-222'>[13] <span>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, </span><i>one</i><span> like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-223'>[14] <span>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion </span><i>is</i><span> an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom </span><i>that</i><span> which shall not be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-224'>[15] <span>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of </span><i>my</i><span> body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-225'>[16] <span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-228'>[19] <span>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth </span><i>were of</i><span> iron, and his nails </span><i>of</i><span> brass; </span><i>which</i><span> devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-230'>[21] <span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-231'>[22] <span>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-232'>[23] <span>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-233'>[24] <span>And the ten horns out of this kingdom </span><i>are</i><span> ten kings </span><i>that</i><span> shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-234'>[25] <span>And he shall speak </span><i>great</i><span> words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-235'>[26] <span>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy </span><i>it</i><span> unto the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-236'>[27] <span>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom </span><i>is</i><span> an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-237'>[28] <span>Hitherto </span><i>is</i><span> the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-239'>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'>[1] <span>In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'>[2] <span>In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[3] <span>I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[4] <span>I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[5] <span>As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[6] <span>He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[7] <span>I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[8] <span>The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[9] <span>Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[10] <span>It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[11] <span>It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[12] <span>Because of rebellion, the host [of the saints] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[13] <span>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, "How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled--the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[14] <span>He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'>[15] <span>While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'>[16] <span>And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, "Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[17] <span>As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. "Son of man," he said to me, "understand that the vision concerns the time of the end."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[18] <span>While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[19] <span>He said: "I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[20] <span>The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[22] <span>The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[23] <span>"In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[24] <span>He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[25] <span>He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[26] <span>"The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[27] <span>I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-242'>[3] <span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had </span><i>two</i><span> horns: and the </span><i>two</i><span> horns </span><i>were</i><span> high; but one </span><i>was</i><span> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-243'>[4] <span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither </span><i>was there any</i><span> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-244'>[5] <span>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat </span><i>had</i><span> a notable horn between his eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-245'>[6] <span>And he came to the ram that had </span><i>two</i><span> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-246'>[7] <span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-247'>[8] <span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-248'>[9] <span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant </span><i>land</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-249'>[10] <span>And it waxed great, </span><i>even</i><span> to the host of heaven; and it cast down </span><i>some</i><span> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-250'>[11] <span>Yea, he magnified </span><i>himself</i><span> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily </span><i>sacrifice</i><span> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-251'>[12] <span>And an host was given </span><i>him</i><span> against the daily </span><i>sacrifice</i><span> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-252'>[13] <span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain </span><i>saint</i><span> which spake, How long </span><i>shall be</i><span> the vision </span><i>concerning</i><span> the daily </span><i>sacrifice</i><span>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-253'>[14] <span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298'>[1] <span>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-299'>[2] <span>At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'>[3] <span>I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'>[4] <span>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[5] <span>I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[6] <span>His body was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[7] <span>I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[8] <span>So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[9] <span>Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[10] <span>A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[11] <span>He said, "Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you." And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[12] <span>Then he continued, "Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[13] <span>But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[14] <span>Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'>[15] <span>While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'>[16] <span>Then one who looked like a man </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup><span> touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, "I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I am helpless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-314'>[17] <span>How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'>[18] <span>Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.</span></div>
