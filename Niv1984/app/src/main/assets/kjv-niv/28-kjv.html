<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, </span><i>and</i><span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, </span><i>departing</i><span> from the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And </span><i>God</i><span> said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Then said </span><i>God</i><span>, Call his name Loammi: for ye </span><i>are</i><span> not my people, and I will not be your </span><i>God</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye </span><i>are</i><span> not my people, </span><i>there</i><span> it shall be said unto them, </span><i>Ye are</i><span> the sons of the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great </span><i>shall be</i><span> the day of Jezreel.</span></div>
