<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, </span><i>and</i><span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, </span><i>departing</i><span> from the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little </span><i>while</i><span>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And </span><i>God</i><span> said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Then said </span><i>God</i><span>, Call his name Loammi: for ye </span><i>are</i><span> not my people, and I will not be your </span><i>God</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye </span><i>are</i><span> not my people, </span><i>there</i><span> it shall be said unto them, </span><i>Ye are</i><span> the sons of the living God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great </span><i>shall be</i><span> the day of Jezreel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[2] <span>Plead with your mother, plead: for she </span><i>is</i><span> not my wife, neither </span><i>am</i><span> I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[3] <span>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[5] <span>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give </span><i>me</i><span> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[6] <span>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[10] <span>And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[11] <span>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[12] <span>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These </span><i>are</i><span> my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[13] <span>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[14] <span>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[15] <span>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[16] <span>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, </span><i>that</i><span> thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[18] <span>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and </span><i>with</i><span> the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[19] <span>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[20] <span>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[21] <span>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[22] <span>And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[23] <span>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to </span><i>them which were</i><span> not my people, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> my people; and they shall say, </span><i>Thou art</i><span> my God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[2] <span>So I bought her to me for fifteen </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver, and </span><i>for</i><span> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[9] <span>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[14] <span>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people </span><i>that</i><span> doth not understand shall fall.</span></div>
