<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> king of Israel:</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, "Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD."</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>In that day I will break Israel's bow in the Valley of Jezreel."</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, "Call her Lo-Ruhamah, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should at all forgive them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>Yet I will show love to the house of Judah; and I will save them--not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but by the LORD their God."</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Then the LORD said, "Call him Lo-Ammi, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> for you are not my people, and I am not your God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>"Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, `You are not my people,' they will be called `sons of the living God.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited, and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[2] <span>"Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[3] <span>Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[17] <span>I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-40'>[1] <span>Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: "There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[2] <span>There is only cursing, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[3] <span>Because of this the land mourns, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying. </span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[6] <span>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[7] <span>The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> their </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-4" id="niv-verse-4-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Glory for something disgraceful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[12] <span>of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.</span></div>
