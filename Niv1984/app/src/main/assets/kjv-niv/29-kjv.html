<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth </span><i>are</i><span> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast </span><i>it</i><span> away; the branches thereof are made white.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, </span><i>even</i><span> all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, </span><i>even</i><span> to the years of many generations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land </span><i>is</i><span> as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The appearance of them </span><i>is</i><span> as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp </span><i>is</i><span> very great: for </span><i>he is</i><span> strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where </span><i>is</i><span> their God?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.</span></div>
