<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your forefathers?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>A nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree-- all the trees of the field--are dried up. Surely the joy of mankind is withered away. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Put on sackcloth, O priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>To you, O LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the open pastures and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-23'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[1] <span>Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming. It is close at hand--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[2] <span>a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes, such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[3] <span>Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste-- nothing escapes them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[4] <span>They have the appearance of horses; they gallop along like cavalry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[5] <span>With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[6] <span>At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; every face turns pale.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[7] <span>They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line, not swerving from their course.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[8] <span>They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[9] <span>They rush upon the city; they run along the wall. They climb into the houses; like thieves they enter through the windows. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[10] <span>Before them the earth shakes, the sky trembles, the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[11] <span>The LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty are those who obey his command. The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it? </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[12] <span>`Even now,` declares the LORD, `return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.` </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[13] <span>Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[14] <span>Who knows? He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing-- grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[15] <span>Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[16] <span>Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[17] <span>Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say, `Spare your people, O LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, `Where is their God?'` </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[18] <span>Then the LORD will be jealous for his land and take pity on his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[19] <span>The LORD will reply </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> to them: `I am sending you grain, new wine and oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[21] <span>Be not afraid, O land; be glad and rejoice. Surely the LORD has done great things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[22] <span>Be not afraid, O wild animals, for the open pastures are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[23] <span>Be glad, O people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains in righteousness. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[24] <span>The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[25] <span>`I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten-- the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">f</a>]</sup><span> -- my great army that I sent among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[26] <span>You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[27] <span>Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[28] <span>`And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[29] <span>Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[30] <span>I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[31] <span>The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[32] <span>And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, among the survivors whom the LORD calls. </span></div>
