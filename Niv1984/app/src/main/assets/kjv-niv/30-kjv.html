<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, </span><i>it was</i><span> the latter growth after the king's mowings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he </span><i>is</i><span> small.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he </span><i>is</i><span> small.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall </span><i>made</i><span> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it </span><i>is</i><span> the king's chapel, and it </span><i>is</i><span> the king's court.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I </span><i>was</i><span> no prophet, neither </span><i>was</i><span> I a prophet's son; but I </span><i>was</i><span> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not </span><i>thy word</i><span> against the house of Isaac.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</span></div>
