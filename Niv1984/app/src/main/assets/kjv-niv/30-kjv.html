<h3>Amos 8</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-8-1'><i>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-8-2'><i>And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-8-3'><i>And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-8-4'><i>Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-8-5'><i>Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-8-6'><i>That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-8-7'><i>The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-8-8'><i>Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-8-11'><i>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:</i>
