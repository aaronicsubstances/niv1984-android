<h2 id='niv-bookmark-113'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'>[1] <span>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'>[2] <span>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'>[3] <span>So the LORD relented. "This will not happen," the LORD said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'>[4] <span>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'>[5] <span>Then I cried out, "Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'>[6] <span>So the LORD relented. "This will not happen either," the Sovereign LORD said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120'>[7] <span>This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'>[8] <span>And the LORD asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" "A plumb line," I replied. Then the Lord said, "Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'>[9] <span>"The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'>[10] <span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: "Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'>[11] <span>For this is what Amos is saying: "`Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'>[12] <span>Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'>[13] <span>Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[14] <span>Amos answered Amaziah, "I was neither a prophet nor a prophet's son, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'>[15] <span>But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[16] <span>Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, "`Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[17] <span>"Therefore this is what the LORD says: "`Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> country. And Israel will certainly go into exile, away from their native land.'"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[2] <span>"What do you see, Amos?" he asked. "A basket of ripe fruit," I answered. Then the LORD said to me, "The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[3] <span>"In that day," declares the Sovereign LORD, "the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Many, many bodies--flung everywhere! Silence!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[11] <span>"The days are coming," declares the Sovereign LORD, "when I will send a famine through the land-- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[12] <span>Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.</span></div>
