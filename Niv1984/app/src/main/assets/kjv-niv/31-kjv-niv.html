<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Sovereign LORD says about Edom-- We have heard a message from the LORD: An envoy was sent to the nations to say, "Rise, and let us go against her for battle"--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>"See, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, `Who can bring me down to the ground?'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation </span><i>is</i><span> high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Though thou exalt </span><i>thyself</i><span> as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>"If thieves came to you, if robbers in the night-- Oh, what a disaster awaits you-- would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave </span><i>some</i><span> grapes?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>How are </span><i>the things</i><span> of Esau searched out! </span><i>how</i><span> are his hidden things sought up!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> but you will not detect it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee </span><i>even</i><span> to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, </span><i>and</i><span> prevailed against thee; </span><i>they that eat</i><span> thy bread have laid a wound under thee: </span><i>there is</i><span> none understanding in him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>"In that day," declares the LORD, "will I not destroy the wise men of Edom, men of understanding in the mountains of Esau?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise </span><i>men</i><span> out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Your warriors, O Teman, will be terrified, and everyone in Esau's mountains will be cut down in the slaughter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And thy mighty </span><i>men</i><span>, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame; you will be destroyed forever.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou </span><i>wast</i><span> as one of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>You should not look down on your brother in the day of his misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast so much in the day of their trouble.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor look down on them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives, nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"The day of the LORD is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head.</span></div></div>
