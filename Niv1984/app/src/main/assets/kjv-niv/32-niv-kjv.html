<div class="flex-container">
<div id='verse-1' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-2' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>"Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me."</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-3' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-4' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Then the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-5' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that </span><i>were</i><span> in the ship into the sea, to lighten </span><i>it</i><span> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-6' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us, and we will not perish."</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-7' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil </span><i>is</i><span> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Then the sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity." They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-8' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil </span><i>is</i><span> upon us; What </span><i>is</i><span> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what </span><i>is</i><span> thy country? and of what people </span><i>art</i><span> thou?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-9' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And he said unto them, I </span><i>am</i><span> an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry </span><i>land</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>He answered, "I am a Hebrew and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land."</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-10' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>This terrified them and they asked, "What have you done?" (They knew he was running away from the LORD, because he had already told them so.)</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-11' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-12' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest </span><i>is</i><span> upon you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>"Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you."</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-13' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring </span><i>it</i><span> to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-14' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Then they cried to the LORD, "O LORD, please do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, O LORD, have done as you pleased."</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-15' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-16' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-17' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>But the LORD provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-30' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city--a visit required three days.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-31' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He prayed to the LORD, "O LORD, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish.

<div id='verse-40' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for </span><i>it is</i><span> better for me to die than to live.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Then the LORD God provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the vine.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-44' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</span></div></div>
