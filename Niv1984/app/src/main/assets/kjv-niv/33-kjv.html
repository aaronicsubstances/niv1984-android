<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, </span><i>and</i><span> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, </span><i>and</i><span> as the waters </span><i>that are</i><span> poured down a steep place.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For the transgression of Jacob </span><i>is</i><span> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What </span><i>is</i><span> the transgression of Jacob? </span><i>is it</i><span> not Samaria? and what </span><i>are</i><span> the high places of Judah? </span><i>are they</i><span> not Jerusalem?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, </span><i>and</i><span> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered </span><i>it</i><span> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For her wound </span><i>is</i><span> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, </span><i>even</i><span> to Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Declare ye </span><i>it</i><span> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she </span><i>is</i><span> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib </span><i>shall be</i><span> a lie to the kings of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</span>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And they covet fields, and take </span><i>them</i><span> by violence; and houses, and take </span><i>them</i><span> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time </span><i>is</i><span> evil.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>In that day shall </span><i>one</i><span> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, </span><i>and</i><span> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed </span><i>it</i><span> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Prophesy ye not, </span><i>say they to them that</i><span> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, </span><i>that</i><span> they shall not take shame.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>O </span><i>thou that art</i><span> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? </span><i>are</i><span> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Arise ye, and depart; for this </span><i>is</i><span> not </span><i>your</i><span> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy </span><i>you</i><span>, even with a sore destruction.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, </span><i>saying</i><span>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of </span><i>the multitude of</i><span> men.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</span>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; </span><i>Is it</i><span> not for you to know judgment?</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Therefore night </span><i>shall be</i><span> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for </span><i>there is</i><span> no answer of God.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, </span><i>Is</i><span> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed </span><i>as</i><span> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</span>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>But in the last days it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make </span><i>them</i><span> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken </span><i>it</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? </span><i>is there</i><span> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go </span><i>even</i><span> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, </span><i>though</i><span> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, </span><i>yet</i><span> out of thee shall he come forth unto me </span><i>that is</i><span> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth </span><i>have been</i><span> from of old, from everlasting.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Therefore will he give them up, until the time </span><i>that</i><span> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And this </span><i>man</i><span> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver </span><i>us</i><span> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no </span><i>more</i><span> soothsayers:</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</span>

<span>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, </span><i>and</i><span> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, </span><i>or</i><span> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn </span><i>for</i><span> my transgression, the fruit of my body </span><i>for</i><span> the sin of my soul?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>He hath shewed thee, O man, what </span><i>is</i><span> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and </span><i>the man of</i><span> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure </span><i>that is</i><span> abominable?</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Shall I count </span><i>them</i><span> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue </span><i>is</i><span> deceitful in their mouth.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Therefore also will I make </span><i>thee</i><span> sick in smiting thee, in making </span><i>thee</i><span> desolate because of thy sins.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down </span><i>shall be</i><span> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and </span><i>that</i><span> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: </span><i>there is</i><span> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>The good </span><i>man</i><span> is perished out of the earth: and </span><i>there is</i><span> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge </span><i>asketh</i><span> for a reward; and the great </span><i>man</i><span>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>The best of them </span><i>is</i><span> as a brier: the most upright </span><i>is sharper</i><span> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen </span><i>and</i><span> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies </span><i>are</i><span> the men of his own house.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD </span><i>shall be</i><span> a light unto me.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, </span><i>and</i><span> I shall behold his righteousness.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Then </span><i>she that is</i><span> mine enemy shall see </span><i>it</i><span>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<i>In</i><span> the day that thy walls are to be built, </span><i>in</i><span> that day shall the decree be far removed.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<i>In</i><span> that day </span><i>also</i><span> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and </span><i>from</i><span> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and </span><i>from</i><span> mountain to mountain.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily </span><i>in</i><span> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed </span><i>in</i><span> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous </span><i>things</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay </span><i>their</i><span> hand upon </span><i>their</i><span> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Who </span><i>is</i><span> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth </span><i>in</i><span> mercy.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, </span><i>and</i><span> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</span>
