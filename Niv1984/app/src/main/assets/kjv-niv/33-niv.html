<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah--the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Hear, O peoples, all of you, listen, O earth and all who are in it, that the Sovereign LORD may witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. </span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads the high places of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem? </span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used." </span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>For her wound is incurable; it has come to Judah. It </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>Tell it not in Gath </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ; weep not at all. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> In Beth Ophrah </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> roll in the dust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>Pass on in nakedness and shame, you who live in Shaphir. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Those who live in Zaanan </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; its protection is taken from you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>Those who live in Maroth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-7" id="niv-verse-1-7">g</a>]</sup><span> writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>You who live in Lachish, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-8" id="niv-verse-1-8">h</a>]</sup><span> harness the team to the chariot. You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Aczib </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-9" id="niv-verse-1-9">i</a>]</sup><span> will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-10" id="niv-verse-1-10">j</a>]</sup><span> He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>Shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourselves as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile. </span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-17'>[1] <span>Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[2] <span>They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[3] <span>Therefore, the LORD says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[4] <span>In that day men will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: `We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'" </span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[5] <span>Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot. </span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[6] <span>"Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[7] <span>Should it be said, O house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of the LORD angry? Does he do such things?" "Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright?</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[8] <span>Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[9] <span>You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[10] <span>Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[11] <span>If a liar and deceiver comes and says, `I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' he would be just the prophet for this people! </span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[12] <span>"I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[13] <span>One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head."</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-30'>[1] <span>Then I said, "Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Should you not know justice,</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[2] <span>you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones;</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[3] <span>who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?" </span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[4] <span>Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[5] <span>This is what the LORD says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, if one feeds them, they proclaim `peace'; if he does not, they prepare to wage war against him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[6] <span>Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[7] <span>The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God." </span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[8] <span>But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[9] <span>Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[10] <span>who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[11] <span>Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD and say, "Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[12] <span>Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[1] <span>In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and peoples will stream to it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[2] <span>Many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[3] <span>He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[9] <span>Why do you now cry aloud-- have you no king? Has your counselor perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[10] <span>Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies. </span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[11] <span>But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[12] <span>But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor. </span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[13] <span>"Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hoofs of bronze and you will break to pieces many nations." You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth. </span></div>
