<h2 id='niv-bookmark-98'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The godly have been swept from the land; not one upright man remains. All men lie in wait to shed blood; each hunts his brother with a net.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire-- they all conspire together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- a man's enemies are the members of his own household. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will lay their hands on their mouths and their ears will become deaf.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>You will be true to Jacob, and show mercy to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our fathers in days long ago. </span></div>
