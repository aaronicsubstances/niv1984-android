<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [Nineveh]; he will pursue his foes into darkness. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Whatever they plot against the LORD he </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>From you, [O Nineveh,] has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and counsels wickedness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>This is what the LORD says: "Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, [O Judah,] I will afflict you no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The LORD has given a command concerning you, [Nineveh]: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile." </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed. </span></div>
