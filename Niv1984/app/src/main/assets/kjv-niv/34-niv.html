<h3>Nahum 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [Nineveh]; he will pursue his foes into darkness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>Whatever they plot against the LORD he 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_1">1</a>]</sup> will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_2">2</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>From you, [O Nineveh,] has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and counsels wickedness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>This is what the LORD says: "Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, [O Judah,] I will afflict you no more.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>The LORD has given a command concerning you, [Nineveh]: "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.
