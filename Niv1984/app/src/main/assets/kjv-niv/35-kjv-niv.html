</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.

<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Then they sweep past like the wind and go on-- guilty men, whose own strength is their god."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'><b>(NIV)</b> You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</i>
