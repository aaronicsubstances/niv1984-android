<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! </span><i>even</i><span> cry out unto thee </span><i>of</i><span> violence, and thou wilt not save!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause </span><i>me</i><span> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence </span><i>are</i><span> before me: and there are </span><i>that</i><span> raise up strife and contention.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for </span><i>I</i><span> will work a work in your days, </span><i>which</i><span> ye will not believe, though it be told </span><i>you</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, </span><i>that</i><span> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces </span><i>that are</i><span> not theirs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They </span><i>are</i><span> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle </span><i>that</i><span> hasteth to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up </span><i>as</i><span> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then shall </span><i>his</i><span> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, </span><i>imputing</i><span> this his power unto his god.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <i>Art</i><span> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <i>Thou art</i><span> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, </span><i>and</i><span> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth </span><i>the man that is</i><span> more righteous than he?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, </span><i>that have</i><span> no ruler over them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion </span><i>is</i><span> fat, and their meat plenteous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></div>
