<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! </span><i>even</i><span> cry out unto thee </span><i>of</i><span> violence, and thou wilt not save!</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause </span><i>me</i><span> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence </span><i>are</i><span> before me: and there are </span><i>that</i><span> raise up strife and contention.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for </span><i>I</i><span> will work a work in your days, </span><i>which</i><span> ye will not believe, though it be told </span><i>you</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, </span><i>that</i><span> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces </span><i>that are</i><span> not theirs.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>They </span><i>are</i><span> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle </span><i>that</i><span> hasteth to eat.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up </span><i>as</i><span> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Then shall </span><i>his</i><span> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, </span><i>imputing</i><span> this his power unto his god.</span></div>

<div>[12] <i>Art</i><span> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span></div>

<div>[13] <i>Thou art</i><span> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, </span><i>and</i><span> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth </span><i>the man that is</i><span> more righteous than he?</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, </span><i>that have</i><span> no ruler over them?</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion </span><i>is</i><span> fat, and their meat plenteous.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make </span><i>it</i><span> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>For the vision </span><i>is</i><span> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Behold, his soul </span><i>which</i><span> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, </span><i>he is</i><span> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and </span><i>is</i><span> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth </span><i>that which is</i><span> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and </span><i>for</i><span> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned </span><i>against</i><span> thy soul.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Behold, </span><i>is it</i><span> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to </span><i>him</i><span>, and makest </span><i>him</i><span> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing </span><i>shall be</i><span> on thy glory.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, </span><i>which</i><span> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it </span><i>is</i><span> laid over with gold and silver, and </span><i>there is</i><span> no breath at all in the midst of it.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>But the LORD </span><i>is</i><span> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, </span><i>and</i><span> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>And </span><i>his</i><span> brightness was as the light; he had horns </span><i>coming</i><span> out of his hand: and there </span><i>was</i><span> the hiding of his power.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways </span><i>are</i><span> everlasting.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: </span><i>and</i><span> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? </span><i>was</i><span> thine anger against the rivers? </span><i>was</i><span> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses </span><i>and</i><span> thy chariots of salvation?</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Thy bow was made quite naked, </span><i>according</i><span> to the oaths of the tribes, </span><i>even thy</i><span> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>The mountains saw thee, </span><i>and</i><span> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, </span><i>and</i><span> lifted up his hands on high.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>The sun </span><i>and</i><span> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, </span><i>and</i><span> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, </span><i>even</i><span> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing </span><i>was</i><span> as to devour the poor secretly.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, </span><i>through</i><span> the heap of great waters.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither </span><i>shall</i><span> fruit </span><i>be</i><span> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and </span><i>there shall be</i><span> no herd in the stalls:</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>The LORD God </span><i>is</i><span> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' </span><i>feet</i><span>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</span></div>
