<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! </span><i>even</i><span> cry out unto thee </span><i>of</i><span> violence, and thou wilt not save!</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause </span><i>me</i><span> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence </span><i>are</i><span> before me: and there are </span><i>that</i><span> raise up strife and contention.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted. </span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Look at the nations and watch-- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for </span><i>I</i><span> will work a work in your days, </span><i>which</i><span> ye will not believe, though it be told </span><i>you</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am raising up the Babylonians, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, </span><i>that</i><span> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces </span><i>that are</i><span> not theirs.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>They </span><i>are</i><span> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then they sweep past like the wind and go on-- guilty men, whose own strength is their god." </span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then shall </span><i>his</i><span> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, </span><i>imputing</i><span> this his power unto his god.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Art</i><span> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Thou art</i><span> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, </span><i>and</i><span> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth </span><i>the man that is</i><span> more righteous than he?</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, </span><i>that have</i><span> no ruler over them?</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion </span><i>is</i><span> fat, and their meat plenteous.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy? </span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></div>
