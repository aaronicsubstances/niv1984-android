<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;</i>
</li></ol>

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</i>
