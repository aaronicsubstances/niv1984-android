<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth," declares the LORD.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"I will sweep away both men and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal, the names of the pagan and the idolatrous priests--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the LORD and who also swear by Molech, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"On that day," declares the LORD, "a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>I will bring distress on the people and they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like filth.</span></div>
