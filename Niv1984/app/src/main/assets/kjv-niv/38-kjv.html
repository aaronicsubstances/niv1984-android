<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and </span><i>from</i><span> your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Your fathers, where </span><i>are</i><span> they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which </span><i>is</i><span> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that </span><i>were</i><span> in the bottom; and behind him </span><i>were there</i><span> red horses, speckled, and white.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then said I, O my lord, what </span><i>are</i><span> these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these </span><i>be</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These </span><i>are they</i><span> whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me </span><i>with</i><span> good words </span><i>and</i><span> comfortable words.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen </span><i>that are</i><span> at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What </span><i>be</i><span> these? And he answered me, These </span><i>are</i><span> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These </span><i>are</i><span> the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up </span><i>their</i><span> horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</span>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what </span><i>is</i><span> the breadth thereof, and what </span><i>is</i><span> the length thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited </span><i>as</i><span> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Ho, ho, </span><i>come forth</i><span>, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest </span><i>with</i><span> the daughter of Babylon.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</span>

<div>[1]
<span>And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: </span><i>is</i><span> not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they </span><i>are</i><span> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone </span><i>shall be</i><span> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</span>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all </span><i>of</i><span> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which </span><i>are</i><span> upon the top thereof:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right </span><i>side</i><span> of the bowl, and the other upon the left </span><i>side</i><span> thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What </span><i>are</i><span> these, my lord?</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This </span><i>is</i><span> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Who </span><i>art</i><span> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel </span><i>thou shalt become</i><span> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone </span><i>thereof with</i><span> shoutings, </span><i>crying</i><span>, Grace, grace unto it.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel </span><i>with</i><span> those seven; they </span><i>are</i><span> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Then answered I, and said unto him, What </span><i>are</i><span> these two olive trees upon the right </span><i>side</i><span> of the candlestick and upon the left </span><i>side</i><span> thereof?</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And I answered again, and said unto him, What </span><i>be these</i><span> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden </span><i>oil</i><span> out of themselves?</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these </span><i>be</i><span>? And I said, No, my lord.</span>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof </span><i>is</i><span> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Then said he unto me, This </span><i>is</i><span> the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off </span><i>as</i><span> on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off </span><i>as</i><span> on that side according to it.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what </span><i>is</i><span> this that goeth forth.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And I said, What </span><i>is</i><span> it? And he said, This </span><i>is</i><span> an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This </span><i>is</i><span> their resemblance through all the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this </span><i>is</i><span> a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And he said, This </span><i>is</i><span> wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind </span><i>was</i><span> in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.</span>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains </span><i>were</i><span> mountains of brass.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>In the first chariot </span><i>were</i><span> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What </span><i>are</i><span> these, my lord?</span>

<div>[5]
<span>And the angel answered and said unto me, These </span><i>are</i><span> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>The black horses which </span><i>are</i><span> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</span>

<div>[8]
<span>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</span>

<div>[11]
<span>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set </span><i>them</i><span> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</span>

<div>[13]

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, </span><i>that</i><span> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth </span><i>day</i><span> of the ninth month, </span><i>even</i><span> in Chisleu;</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<i>And</i><span> to speak unto the priests which </span><i>were</i><span> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh </span><i>month</i><span>, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, </span><i>even</i><span> to me?</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat </span><i>for yourselves</i><span>, and drink </span><i>for yourselves</i><span>?</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<i>Should ye</i><span> not </span><i>hear</i><span> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when </span><i>men</i><span> inhabited the south and the plain?</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Yea, they made their hearts </span><i>as</i><span> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Therefore it is come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</span>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Again the word of the LORD of hosts came </span><i>to me</i><span>, saying,</span>

<div>[2]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which </span><i>were</i><span> in the day </span><i>that</i><span> the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither </span><i>was there any</i><span> peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>But now I </span><i>will</i><span> not </span><i>be</i><span> unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>For the seed </span><i>shall be</i><span> prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these </span><i>things</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, </span><i>but</i><span> let your hands be strong.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>These </span><i>are</i><span> the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these </span><i>are things</i><span> that I hate, saith the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,</span>

<div>[19]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth </span><i>month</i><span>, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; </span><i>It shall</i><span> yet </span><i>come to pass</i><span>, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>And the inhabitants of one </span><i>city</i><span> shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days </span><i>it shall come to pass</i><span>, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard </span><i>that</i><span> God </span><i>is</i><span> with you.</span>

<span>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he </span><i>is</i><span> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</span>

<div>[10]
<span>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion </span><i>shall be</i><span> from sea </span><i>even</i><span> to sea, and from the river </span><i>even</i><span> to the ends of the earth.</span>

<div>[13]
<span>When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.</span>

<span>And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</span>

<span>The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, </span><i>and</i><span> make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, </span><i>and</i><span> as the corners of the altar.</span>

</div>

<div>[2]
<span>For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because </span><i>there was</i><span> no shepherd.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</span>

<span>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<i>There is</i><span> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver </span><i>them</i><span>.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, </span><i>even</i><span> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>And I took my staff, </span><i>even</i><span> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it </span><i>was</i><span> the word of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give </span><i>me</i><span> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, </span><i>even</i><span> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, </span><i>which</i><span> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</span>

<div>[17]
<span>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword </span><i>shall be</i><span> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span>
