<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her </span><i>that had been the wife</i><span> of Urias;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>So all the generations from Abraham to David </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>Then Joseph her husband, being a just </span><i>man</i><span>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-28'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[1] <span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[2] <span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[3] <span>When Herod the king had heard </span><i>these things</i><span>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[4] <span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[5] <span>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[6] <span>And thou Bethlehem, </span><i>in</i><span> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[7] <span>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[8] <span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found </span><i>him</i><span>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[9] <span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[10] <span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[11] <span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[12] <span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[13] <span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[14] <span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[15] <span>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[16] <span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[17] <span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[18] <span>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping </span><i>for</i><span> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[19] <span>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[20] <span>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[21] <span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[22] <span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[23] <span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-53'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[1] <span>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[2] <span>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[3] <span>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[4] <span>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[5] <span>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[6] <span>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[7] <span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[8] <span>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[9] <span>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to </span><i>our</i><span> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[10] <span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[11] <span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and </span><i>with</i><span> fire:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[12] <span>Whose fan </span><i>is</i><span> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[13] <span>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'>[14] <span>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'>[15] <span>And Jesus answering said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Suffer </span><i class="wj">it to be so</i><span class="wj"> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</span><span> Then he suffered him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'>[16] <span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[17] <span>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-72'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[1] <span>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'>[2] <span>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'>[3] <span>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'>[4] <span>But he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'>[5] <span>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-78'>[6] <span>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in </span><i>their</i><span> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'>[7] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-80'>[8] <span>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-81'>[9] <span>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-82'>[10] <span>Then saith Jesus unto him, </span><span class="wj">Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-83'>[11] <span>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-84'>[12] <span>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'>[13] <span>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-86'>[14] <span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'>[15] <span>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, </span><i>by</i><span> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-88'>[16] <span>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-89'>[17] <span>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, </span><span class="wj">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-90'>[18] <span>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-91'>[19] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-92'>[20] <span>And they straightway left </span><i>their</i><span> nets, and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-93'>[21] <span>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James </span><i>the son</i><span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-94'>[22] <span>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-95'>[23] <span>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-96'>[24] <span>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-446'>[26] <span class="wj">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-447'>[27] <span class="wj">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-449'>[29] <span class="wj">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-450'>[30] <span class="wj">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-451'>[31] <span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-452'>[32] <span class="wj">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-453'>[33] <span>Another parable spake he unto them; </span><span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-454'>[34] <span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-455'>[35] <span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-456'>[36] <span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-459'>[39] <span class="wj">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-460'>[40] <span class="wj">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-461'>[41] <span class="wj">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-462'>[42] <span class="wj">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-463'>[43] <span class="wj">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-464'>[44] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-465'>[45] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-466'>[46] <span class="wj">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-467'>[47] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-468'>[48] <span class="wj">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-469'>[49] <span class="wj">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-774'>[3] <span class="wj">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-775'>[4] <span class="wj">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and </span><i class="wj">my</i><span class="wj"> fatlings </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> killed, and all things </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> ready: come unto the marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-776'>[5] <span class="wj">But they made light of </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-777'>[6] <span class="wj">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> spitefully, and slew </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-778'>[7] <span class="wj">But when the king heard </span><i class="wj">thereof</i><span class="wj">, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-779'>[8] <span class="wj">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-780'>[9] <span class="wj">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-781'>[10] <span class="wj">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-782'>[11] <span class="wj">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-783'>[12] <span class="wj">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-784'>[13] <span class="wj">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-785'>[14] <span class="wj">For many are called, but few </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> chosen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-786'>[15] <span>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in </span><i>his</i><span> talk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-787'>[16] <span>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any </span><i>man</i><span>: for thou regardest not the person of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-788'>[17] <span>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-789'>[18] <span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, </span><span class="wj">Why tempt ye me, </span><i class="wj">ye</i><span class="wj"> hypocrites?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-790'>[19] <span class="wj">Shew me the tribute money.</span><span> And they brought unto him a penny.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-791'>[20] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Whose </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> this image and superscription?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-792'>[21] <span>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, </span><span class="wj">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-793'>[22] <span>When they had heard </span><i>these words</i><span>, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-794'>[23] <span>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-795'>[24] <span>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-796'>[25] <span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-797'>[26] <span>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-798'>[27] <span>And last of all the woman died also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-799'>[28] <span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-800'>[29] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-801'>[30] <span class="wj">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-802'>[31] <span class="wj">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-803'>[32] <span class="wj">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-804'>[33] <span>And when the multitude heard </span><i>this</i><span>, they were astonished at his doctrine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-805'>[34] <span>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-806'>[35] <span>Then one of them, </span><i>which was</i><span> a lawyer, asked </span><i>him a question</i><span>, tempting him, and saying,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-808'>[37] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-809'>[38] <span class="wj">This is the first and great commandment.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-914'>[1] <span class="wj">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-915'>[2] <span class="wj">And five of them were wise, and five </span><i class="wj">were</i><span class="wj"> foolish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-916'>[3] <span class="wj">They that </span><i class="wj">were</i><span class="wj"> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-917'>[4] <span class="wj">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-918'>[5] <span class="wj">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-919'>[6] <span class="wj">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-921'>[8] <span class="wj">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-922'>[9] <span class="wj">But the wise answered, saying, </span><i class="wj">Not so</i><span class="wj">; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-923'>[10] <span class="wj">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-939'>[26] <span class="wj">His lord answered and said unto him, </span><i class="wj">Thou</i><span class="wj"> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-941'>[28] <span class="wj">Take therefore the talent from him, and give </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> unto him which hath ten talents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-942'>[29] <span class="wj">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-943'>[30] <span class="wj">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-962'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-963'>[2] <span class="wj">Ye know that after two days is </span><i class="wj">the feast of</i><span class="wj"> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-964'>[3] <span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-965'>[4] <span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-966'>[5] <span>But they said, Not on the feast </span><i>day</i><span>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-967'>[6] <span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-968'>[7] <span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat </span><i>at meat</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-969'>[8] <span>But when his disciples saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose </span><i>is</i><span> this waste?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-970'>[9] <span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-971'>[10] <span>When Jesus understood </span><i>it</i><span>, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-972'>[11] <span class="wj">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-973'>[12] <span class="wj">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> for my burial.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-974'>[13] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, </span><i class="wj">there</i><span class="wj"> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-975'>[14] <span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-976'>[15] <span>And said </span><i>unto them</i><span>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-978'>[17] <span>Now the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the </span><i>feast of</i><span> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-979'>[18] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-981'>[20] <span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-982'>[21] <span>And as they did eat, he said, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-983'>[22] <span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-984'>[23] <span>And he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">He that dippeth </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-985'>[24] <span class="wj">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-986'>[25] <span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou hast said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-987'>[26] <span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed </span><i>it</i><span>, and brake </span><i>it</i><span>, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> to the disciples, and said, </span><span class="wj">Take, eat; this is my body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-988'>[27] <span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> to them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Drink ye all of it;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-989'>[28] <span class="wj">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-990'>[29] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-991'>[30] <span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-992'>[31] <span>Then saith Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-993'>[32] <span class="wj">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-994'>[33] <span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all </span><i>men</i><span> shall be offended because of thee, </span><i>yet</i><span> will I never be offended.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-995'>[34] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-996'>[35] <span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-997'>[36] <span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, </span><span class="wj">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-998'>[37] <span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-999'>[38] <span>Then saith he unto them, </span><span class="wj">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1000'>[39] <span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, </span><span class="wj">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou </span><i class="wj">wilt</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1001'>[40] <span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, </span><span class="wj">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1002'>[41] <span class="wj">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> willing, but the flesh </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> weak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1003'>[42] <span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, </span><span class="wj">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1004'>[43] <span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1005'>[44] <span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1006'>[45] <span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Sleep on now, and take </span><i class="wj">your</i><span class="wj"> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1007'>[46] <span class="wj">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1008'>[47] <span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1009'>[48] <span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1010'>[49] <span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1011'>[50] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span><span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1012'>[51] <span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1013'>[52] <span>Then said Jesus unto him, </span><span class="wj">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1014'>[53] <span class="wj">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1016'>[55] <span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, </span><span class="wj">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1017'>[56] <span class="wj">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span><span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1020'>[59] <span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1038'>Chapter 27</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1039'>[1] <span>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1040'>[2] <span>And when they had bound him, they led </span><i>him</i><span> away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1041'>[3] <span>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1042'>[4] <span>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What </span><i>is that</i><span> to us? see thou </span><i>to that</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1043'>[5] <span>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1044'>[6] <span>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1045'>[7] <span>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1046'>[8] <span>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1047'>[9] <span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1048'>[10] <span>And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1049'>[11] <span>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou sayest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1050'>[12] <span>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1051'>[13] <span>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1052'>[14] <span>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1053'>[15] <span>Now at </span><i>that</i><span> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1054'>[16] <span>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1055'>[17] <span>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1056'>[18] <span>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1057'>[19] <span>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1058'>[20] <span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1059'>[21] <span>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1060'>[22] <span>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? </span><i>They</i><span> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1061'>[23] <span>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1062'>[24] <span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but </span><i>that</i><span> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed </span><i>his</i><span> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye </span><i>to it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1063'>[25] <span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood </span><i>be</i><span> on us, and on our children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1064'>[26] <span>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered </span><i>him</i><span> to be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1065'>[27] <span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band </span><i>of soldiers</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1066'>[28] <span>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1067'>[29] <span>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put </span><i>it</i><span> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1068'>[30] <span>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1069'>[31] <span>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1070'>[32] <span>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1071'>[33] <span>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1072'>[34] <span>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted </span><i>thereof</i><span>, he would not drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1073'>[35] <span>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1074'>[36] <span>And sitting down they watched him there;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1075'>[37] <span>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1076'>[38] <span>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1077'>[39] <span>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1078'>[40] <span>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest </span><i>it</i><span> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1079'>[41] <span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking </span><i>him</i><span>, with the scribes and elders, said,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1080'>[42] <span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1081'>[43] <span>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1082'>[44] <span>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1083'>[45] <span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1084'>[46] <span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, </span><span class="wj">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</span><span> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1085'>[47] <span>Some of them that stood there, when they heard </span><i>that</i><span>, said, This </span><i>man</i><span> calleth for Elias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1086'>[48] <span>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled </span><i>it</i><span> with vinegar, and put </span><i>it</i><span> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1087'>[49] <span>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1088'>[50] <span>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1089'>[51] <span>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1090'>[52] <span>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1091'>[53] <span>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1092'>[54] <span>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1093'>[55] <span>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1094'>[56] <span>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1095'>[57] <span>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1096'>[58] <span>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1097'>[59] <span>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1098'>[60] <span>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1099'>[61] <span>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1100'>[62] <span>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1101'>[63] <span>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1102'>[64] <span>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1103'>[65] <span>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make </span><i>it</i><span> as sure as ye can.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1104'>[66] <span>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1107'>[1] <span>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1108'>[2] <span>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1109'>[3] <span>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1110'>[4] <span>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead </span><i>men</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1111'>[5] <span>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1113'>[7] <span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1114'>[8] <span>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1115'>[9] <span>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, </span><span class="wj">All hail.</span><span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1116'>[10] <span>Then said Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1117'>[11] <span>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1118'>[12] <span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1119'>[13] <span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him </span><i>away</i><span> while we slept.</span></div>
