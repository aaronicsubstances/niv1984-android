<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her </span><i>that had been the wife</i><span> of Urias;</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>So all the generations from Abraham to David </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ </span><i>are</i><span> fourteen generations.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>Then Joseph her husband, being a just </span><i>man</i><span>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-26'>[1] <span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[2] <span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[3] <span>When Herod the king had heard </span><i>these things</i><span>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[4] <span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[5] <span>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[6] <span>And thou Bethlehem, </span><i>in</i><span> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[7] <span>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[8] <span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found </span><i>him</i><span>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[9] <span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[10] <span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[11] <span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[12] <span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[13] <span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[14] <span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[15] <span>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[16] <span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[17] <span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[18] <span>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping </span><i>for</i><span> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[19] <span>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[20] <span>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[21] <span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[22] <span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[23] <span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-49'>[1] <span>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[2] <span>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[3] <span>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[4] <span>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[5] <span>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[6] <span>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[7] <span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[8] <span>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[9] <span>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to </span><i>our</i><span> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[10] <span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[11] <span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and </span><i>with</i><span> fire:</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[12] <span>Whose fan </span><i>is</i><span> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[13] <span>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[14] <span>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[15] <span>And Jesus answering said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Suffer </span><i class="wj">it to be so</i><span class="wj"> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</span><span> Then he suffered him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[16] <span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[17] <span>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-66'>[1] <span>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[2] <span>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[3] <span>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[4] <span>But he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[5] <span>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[6] <span>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in </span><i>their</i><span> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[7] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[8] <span>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[9] <span>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[10] <span>Then saith Jesus unto him, </span><span class="wj">Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[11] <span>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[12] <span>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[13] <span>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[14] <span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[15] <span>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, </span><i>by</i><span> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[16] <span>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[17] <span>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, </span><span class="wj">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[18] <span>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[19] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[20] <span>And they straightway left </span><i>their</i><span> nets, and followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[21] <span>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James </span><i>the son</i><span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[22] <span>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[23] <span>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[24] <span>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[25] <span>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and </span><i>from</i><span> Decapolis, and </span><i>from</i><span> Jerusalem, and </span><i>from</i><span> Judaea, and </span><i>from</i><span> beyond Jordan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[45] <span class="wj">That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[46] <span class="wj">For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[47] <span class="wj">And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more </span><i class="wj">than others</i><span class="wj">? do not even the publicans so?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-139'>[1] <span class="wj">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[2] <span class="wj">Therefore when thou doest </span><i class="wj">thine</i><span class="wj"> alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[3] <span class="wj">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span></div>

<div id='verse-142'>[4] <span class="wj">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-143'>[5] <span class="wj">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj">: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[6] <span class="wj">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[7] <span class="wj">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen </span><i class="wj">do</i><span class="wj">: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[8] <span class="wj">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[9] <span class="wj">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[10] <span class="wj">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as </span><i class="wj">it is</i><span class="wj"> in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[11] <span class="wj">Give us this day our daily bread.</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[12] <span class="wj">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[13] <span class="wj">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[14] <span class="wj">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[15] <span class="wj">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[16] <span class="wj">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[17] <span class="wj">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[18] <span class="wj">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[19] <span class="wj">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[20] <span class="wj">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[21] <span class="wj">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[22] <span class="wj">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[23] <span class="wj">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> that darkness!</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[24] <span class="wj">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[25] <span class="wj">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[26] <span class="wj">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[27] <span class="wj">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[28] <span class="wj">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[29] <span class="wj">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[30] <span class="wj">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, </span><i class="wj">shall he</i><span class="wj"> not much more </span><i class="wj">clothe</i><span class="wj"> you, O ye of little faith?</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[31] <span class="wj">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[32] <span class="wj">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[33] <span class="wj">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[34] <span class="wj">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> the evil thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[1] <span class="wj">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[2] <span class="wj">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[3] <span class="wj">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[4] <span class="wj">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> in thine own eye?</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[5] <span class="wj">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[6] <span class="wj">Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-180'>[8] <span class="wj">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-181'>[9] <span class="wj">Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[10] <span class="wj">Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[11] <span class="wj">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[12] <span class="wj">Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[13] <span class="wj">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> the gate, and broad </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</span></div>

<div id='verse-186'>[14] <span class="wj">Because strait </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> the gate, and narrow </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-187'>[15] <span class="wj">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[19] <span class="wj">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[20] <span class="wj">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-193'>[21] <span class="wj">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-194'>[22] <span class="wj">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[23] <span class="wj">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[24] <span class="wj">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[3] <span>And Jesus put forth </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and touched him, saying, </span><span class="wj">I will; be thou clean.</span><span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[4] <span>And Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-206'>[5] <span>And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-207'>[6] <span>And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[7] <span>And Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">I will come and heal him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-209'>[8] <span>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-210'>[9] <span>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this </span><i>man</i><span>, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-211'>[10] <span>When Jesus heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-212'>[11] <span class="wj">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-213'>[12] <span class="wj">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-214'>[13] <span>And Jesus said unto the centurion, </span><span class="wj">Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, </span><i class="wj">so</i><span class="wj"> be it done unto thee.</span><span> And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-215'>[14] <span>And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-216'>[15] <span>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-217'>[16] <span>When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with </span><i>his</i><span> word, and healed all that were sick:</span></div>

<div id='verse-219'>[18] <span>Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</span></div>

<div id='verse-221'>[20] <span>And Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air </span><i class="wj">have</i><span class="wj"> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> head.</span></div>

<div id='verse-222'>[21] <span>And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-226'>[25] <span>And his disciples came to </span><i>him</i><span>, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-227'>[26] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</span><span> Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</span></div>

<div id='verse-228'>[27] <span>But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</span></div>

<div id='verse-229'>[28] <span>And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-230'>[29] <span>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</span></div>

<div id='verse-231'>[30] <span>And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</span></div>

<div id='verse-232'>[31] <span>So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</span></div>

<div id='verse-233'>[32] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Go.</span><span> And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-234'>[33] <span>And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</span></div>

<div id='verse-235'>[34] <span>And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought </span><i>him</i><span> that he would depart out of their coasts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-250'>[15] <span>And Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[20] <span>And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind </span><i>him</i><span>, and touched the hem of his garment:</span></div>

<div id='verse-278'>[5] <span>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into </span><i class="wj">any</i><span class="wj"> city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[10] <span class="wj">Nor scrip for </span><i class="wj">your</i><span class="wj"> journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[11] <span class="wj">And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[12] <span class="wj">And when ye come into an house, salute it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[13] <span class="wj">And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[14] <span class="wj">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[15] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[19] <span class="wj">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[28] <span class="wj">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-316'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</span></div>

<div id='verse-317'>[2] <span>Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</span></div>

<div id='verse-318'>[3] <span>And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</span></div>

<div id='verse-319'>[4] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</span></div>

<div id='verse-320'>[5] <span class="wj">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-321'>[6] <span class="wj">And blessed is </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-322'>[7] <span>And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, </span><span class="wj">What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span></div>

<div id='verse-323'>[8] <span class="wj">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft </span><i class="wj">clothing</i><span class="wj"> are in kings' houses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-324'>[9] <span class="wj">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-325'>[10] <span class="wj">For this is </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-326'>[11] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span></div>

<div id='verse-327'>[12] <span class="wj">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</span></div>

<div id='verse-328'>[13] <span class="wj">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span></div>

<div id='verse-329'>[14] <span class="wj">And if ye will receive </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, this is Elias, which was for to come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-330'>[15] <span class="wj">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-331'>[16] <span class="wj">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</span></div>

<div id='verse-332'>[17] <span class="wj">And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</span></div>

<div id='verse-333'>[18] <span class="wj">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-334'>[19] <span class="wj">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-335'>[20] <span>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</span></div>

<div id='verse-336'>[21] <span class="wj">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-337'>[22] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-338'>[23] <span class="wj">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-339'>[24] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-340'>[25] <span>At that time Jesus answered and said, </span><span class="wj">I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-341'>[26] <span class="wj">Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span></div>

<div id='verse-342'>[27] <span class="wj">All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj"> to whomsoever the Son will reveal </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>

<div id='verse-343'>[28] <span class="wj">Come unto me, all </span><i class="wj">ye</i><span class="wj"> that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-344'>[29] <span class="wj">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-346'>[1] <span>At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-347'>[2] <span>But when the Pharisees saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-348'>[3] <span>But he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</span></div>

<div id='verse-349'>[4] <span class="wj">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</span></div>

<div id='verse-350'>[5] <span class="wj">Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</span></div>

<div id='verse-351'>[6] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, That in this place is </span><i class="wj">one</i><span class="wj"> greater than the temple.</span></div>

<div id='verse-352'>[7] <span class="wj">But if ye had known what </span><i class="wj">this</i><span class="wj"> meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</span></div>

<div id='verse-353'>[8] <span class="wj">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-354'>[9] <span>And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</span></div>

<div id='verse-355'>[10] <span>And, behold, there was a man which had </span><i>his</i><span> hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-356'>[11] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> out?</span></div>

<div id='verse-357'>[12] <span class="wj">How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-358'>[13] <span>Then saith he to the man, </span><span class="wj">Stretch forth thine hand.</span><span> And he stretched </span><i>it</i><span> forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</span></div>

<div id='verse-359'>[14] <span>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-360'>[15] <span>But when Jesus knew </span><i>it</i><span>, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</span></div>

<div id='verse-361'>[16] <span>And charged them that they should not make him known:</span></div>

<div id='verse-362'>[17] <span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-363'>[18] <span>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</span></div>

<div id='verse-364'>[19] <span>He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[20] <span>A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</span></div>

<div id='verse-366'>[21] <span>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</span></div>

<div id='verse-367'>[22] <span>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</span></div>

<div id='verse-368'>[23] <span>And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</span></div>

<div id='verse-369'>[24] <span>But when the Pharisees heard </span><i>it</i><span>, they said, This </span><i>fellow</i><span> doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</span></div>

<div id='verse-370'>[25] <span>And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</span></div>

<div id='verse-371'>[26] <span class="wj">And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-372'>[27] <span class="wj">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> out? therefore they shall be your judges.</span></div>

<div id='verse-373'>[28] <span class="wj">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-374'>[29] <span class="wj">Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-375'>[30] <span class="wj">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[31] <span class="wj">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy </span><i class="wj">against</i><span class="wj"> the </span><i class="wj">Holy</i><span class="wj"> Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-377'>[32] <span class="wj">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the </span><i class="wj">world</i><span class="wj"> to come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[33] <span class="wj">Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> fruit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[34] <span class="wj">O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-380'>[35] <span class="wj">A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-384'>[39] <span>But he answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[40] <span class="wj">For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-386'>[41] <span class="wj">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> here.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[42] <span class="wj">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> here.</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[43] <span class="wj">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[44] <span class="wj">Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> empty, swept, and garnished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[45] <span class="wj">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last </span><i class="wj">state</i><span class="wj"> of that man is worse than the first.

<div id='verse-391'>[46] <span>While he yet talked to the people, behold, </span><i>his</i><span> mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[47] <span>Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[48] <span>But he answered and said unto him that told him, </span><span class="wj">Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[49] <span>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, </span><span class="wj">Behold my mother and my brethren!</span></div>

This is he which received seed by the way side.</span></div>

<div id='verse-415'>[20] <span class="wj">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</span></div>

<div id='verse-416'>[21] <span class="wj">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</span></div>

<div id='verse-417'>[22] <span class="wj">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-418'>[23] <span class="wj">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span></div>

<div id='verse-419'>[24] <span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</span></div>

<div id='verse-420'>[25] <span class="wj">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-421'>[26] <span class="wj">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span></div>

<div id='verse-422'>[27] <span class="wj">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</span></div>

<div id='verse-423'>[28] <span class="wj">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[29] <span class="wj">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-425'>[30] <span class="wj">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></div>

<div id='verse-426'>[31] <span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span></div>

<div id='verse-427'>[32] <span class="wj">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[33] <span>Another parable spake he unto them; </span><span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[34] <span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[35] <span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[36] <span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[37] <span>He answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span></div>

<div id='verse-433'>[38] <span class="wj">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked </span><i class="wj">one</i><span class="wj">;</span></div>

<div id='verse-434'>[39] <span class="wj">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span></div>

<div id='verse-435'>[40] <span class="wj">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</span></div>

<div id='verse-436'>[41] <span class="wj">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[42] <span class="wj">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[43] <span class="wj">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-439'>[44] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span></div>

<div id='verse-440'>[45] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[46] <span class="wj">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-442'>[47] <span class="wj">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span></div>

<div id='verse-443'>[48] <span class="wj">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-444'>[49] <span class="wj">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</span></div>

<div id='verse-445'>[50] <span class="wj">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-446'>[51] <span>Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Have ye understood all these things?</span><span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[52] <span>Then said he unto them, </span><span class="wj">Therefore every scribe </span><i class="wj">which is</i><span class="wj"> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man </span><i class="wj">that is</i><span class="wj"> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure </span><i class="wj">things</i><span class="wj"> new and old.</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[53] <span>And it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[54] <span>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this </span><i>man</i><span> this wisdom, and </span><i>these</i><span> mighty works?</span></div>

<div id='verse-450'>[55] <span>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</span></div>

<div id='verse-451'>[56] <span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this </span><i>man</i><span> all these things?</span></div>

<div id='verse-452'>[57] <span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-453'>[58] <span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-454'>[1] <span>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</span></div>

<div id='verse-455'>[2] <span>And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-456'>[3] <span>For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put </span><i>him</i><span> in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-457'>[4] <span>For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-458'>[5] <span>And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-459'>[6] <span>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</span></div>

<div id='verse-460'>[7] <span>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</span></div>

<div id='verse-461'>[8] <span>And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-462'>[9] <span>And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded </span><i>it</i><span> to be given </span><i>her</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-463'>[10] <span>And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</span></div>

<div id='verse-464'>[11] <span>And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought </span><i>it</i><span> to her mother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-465'>[12] <span>And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-466'>[13] <span>When Jesus heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard </span><i>thereof</i><span>, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</span></div>

<div id='verse-467'>[14] <span>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</span></div>

<div id='verse-468'>[15] <span>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</span></div>

<div id='verse-469'>[16] <span>But Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-470'>[17] <span>And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-471'>[18] <span>He said, </span><span class="wj">Bring them hither to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-472'>[19] <span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to </span><i>his</i><span> disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span></div>

<div id='verse-473'>[20] <span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</span></div>

<div id='verse-474'>[21] <span>And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-475'>[22] <span>And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-476'>[23] <span>And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-477'>[24] <span>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</span></div>

<div id='verse-478'>[25] <span>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</span></div>

<div id='verse-479'>[26] <span>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-480'>[27] <span>But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-481'>[28] <span>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-482'>[29] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Come.</span><span> And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-483'>[30] <span>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-484'>[31] <span>And immediately Jesus stretched forth </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and caught him, and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</span></div>

<div id='verse-485'>[32] <span>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</span></div>

<div id='verse-486'>[33] <span>Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-487'>[34] <span>And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</span></div>

<div id='verse-488'>[35] <span>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-490'>[1] <span>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-491'>[2] <span>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</span></div>

<div id='verse-492'>[3] <span>But he answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</span></div>

<div id='verse-493'>[4] <span class="wj">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-494'>[5] <span class="wj">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> father or </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> mother, </span><i class="wj">It is</i><span class="wj"> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</span></div>

<div id='verse-495'>[6] <span class="wj">And honour not his father or his mother, </span><i class="wj">he shall be free</i><span class="wj">. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</span></div>

<div id='verse-496'>[7] <i class="wj">Ye</i><span class="wj"> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-497'>[8] <span class="wj">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with </span><i class="wj">their</i><span class="wj"> lips; but their heart is far from me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-498'>[9] <span class="wj">But in vain they do worship me, teaching </span><i class="wj">for</i><span class="wj"> doctrines the commandments of men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-499'>[10] <span>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Hear, and understand:</span></div>

<div id='verse-500'>[11] <span class="wj">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-501'>[12] <span>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</span></div>

<div id='verse-502'>[13] <span>But he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-503'>[14] <span class="wj">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span></div>

<div id='verse-504'>[15] <span>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</span></div>

<div id='verse-505'>[16] <span>And Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Are ye also yet without understanding?</span></div>

<div id='verse-506'>[17] <span class="wj">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span></div>

<div id='verse-507'>[18] <span class="wj">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-509'>[20] <span class="wj">These are </span><i class="wj">the things</i><span class="wj"> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-510'>[21] <span>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-511'>[22] <span>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, </span><i>thou</i><span> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-512'>[23] <span>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-513'>[24] <span>But he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-514'>[25] <span>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-515'>[26] <span>But he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> to dogs.</span></div>

<div id='verse-516'>[27] <span>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span></div>

<div id='verse-518'>[29] <span>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-519'>[30] <span>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them </span><i>those that were</i><span> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-523'>[34] <span>And Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">How many loaves have ye?</span><span> And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-524'>[35] <span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-557'>[1] <span>And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</span></div>

<div id='verse-558'>[2] <span>And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</span></div>

<div id='verse-559'>[3] <span>And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-560'>[4] <span>Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</span></div>

<div id='verse-561'>[5] <span>While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-562'>[6] <span>And when the disciples heard </span><i>it</i><span>, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-563'>[7] <span>And Jesus came and touched them, and said, </span><span class="wj">Arise, and be not afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-564'>[8] <span>And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</span></div>

<div id='verse-565'>[9] <span>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-566'>[10] <span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</span></div>

<div id='verse-567'>[11] <span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-568'>[12] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-569'>[13] <span>Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</span></div>

<div id='verse-570'>[14] <span>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a </span><i>certain</i><span> man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-571'>[15] <span>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-572'>[16] <span>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-573'>[17] <span>Then Jesus answered and said, </span><span class="wj">O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-574'>[18] <span>And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-575'>[19] <span>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</span></div>

<div id='verse-576'>[20] <span>And Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-577'>[21] <span class="wj">Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</span></div>

<div id='verse-578'>[22] <span>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</span></div>

<div id='verse-579'>[23] <span class="wj">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.</span><span> And they were exceeding sorry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-580'>[24] <span>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute </span><i>money</i><span> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</span></div>

<div id='verse-581'>[25] <span>He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, </span><span class="wj">What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</span></div>

<div id='verse-582'>[26] <span>Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Then are the children free.</span></div>

<div id='verse-583'>[27] <span class="wj">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-584'>[1] <span>At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</span></div>

<div id='verse-585'>[2] <span>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</span></div>

<div id='verse-586'>[3] <span>And said, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-587'>[4] <span class="wj">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-588'>[5] <span class="wj">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-589'>[6] <span class="wj">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and </span><i class="wj">that</i><span class="wj"> he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</span></div>

<div id='verse-590'>[7] <span class="wj">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</span></div>

<div id='verse-591'>[8] <span class="wj">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-592'>[9] <span class="wj">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-593'>[10] <span class="wj">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-594'>[11] <span class="wj">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</span></div>

<div id='verse-595'>[12] <span class="wj">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[13] <span class="wj">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that </span><i class="wj">sheep</i><span class="wj">, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</span></div>

<div id='verse-597'>[14] <span class="wj">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-598'>[15] <span class="wj">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-599'>[16] <span class="wj">But if he will not hear </span><i class="wj">thee, then</i><span class="wj"> take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</span></div>

<div id='verse-600'>[17] <span class="wj">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</span></div>

<div id='verse-601'>[18] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-602'>[19] <span class="wj">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-603'>[20] <span class="wj">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-604'>[21] <span>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span></div>

<div id='verse-605'>[22] <span>Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-606'>[23] <span class="wj">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</span></div>

<div id='verse-607'>[24] <span class="wj">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</span></div>

<div id='verse-608'>[25] <span class="wj">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span></div>

<div id='verse-609'>[26] <span class="wj">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-610'>[27] <span class="wj">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-611'>[28] <span class="wj">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-612'>[29] <span class="wj">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-613'>[30] <span class="wj">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span></div>

<div id='verse-614'>[31] <span class="wj">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-615'>[32] <span class="wj">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-616'>[33] <span class="wj">Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-617'>[34] <span class="wj">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-618'>[35] <span class="wj">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-619'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</span></div>

<div id='verse-620'>[2] <span>And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-621'>[3] <span>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</span></div>

<div id='verse-622'>[4] <span>And he answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Have ye not read, that he which made </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> at the beginning made them male and female,</span></div>

<div id='verse-623'>[5] <span class="wj">And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</span></div>

<div id='verse-624'>[6] <span class="wj">Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</span></div>

<div id='verse-625'>[7] <span>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</span></div>

<div id='verse-626'>[8] <span>He saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-627'>[9] <span class="wj">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except </span><i class="wj">it be</i><span class="wj"> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span></div>

<div id='verse-628'>[10] <span>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with </span><i>his</i><span> wife, it is not good to marry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-629'>[11] <span>But he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">All </span><i class="wj">men</i><span class="wj"> cannot receive this saying, save </span><i class="wj">they</i><span class="wj"> to whom it is given.</span></div>

<div id='verse-630'>[12] <span class="wj">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from </span><i class="wj">their</i><span class="wj"> mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, let him receive </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>

<div id='verse-631'>[13] <span>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put </span><i>his</i><span> hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-632'>[14] <span>But Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-633'>[15] <span>And he laid </span><i>his</i><span> hands on them, and departed thence.</span></div>

<div id='verse-634'>[16] <span>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</span></div>

<div id='verse-635'>[17] <span>And he said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Why callest thou me good? </span><i class="wj">there is</i><span class="wj"> none good but one, </span><i class="wj">that is</i><span class="wj">, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span></div>

<div id='verse-636'>[18] <span>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span></div>

<div id='verse-637'>[19] <span class="wj">Honour thy father and </span><i class="wj">thy</i><span class="wj"> mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-638'>[20] <span>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</span></div>

<div id='verse-639'>[21] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">If thou wilt be perfect, go </span><i class="wj">and</i><span class="wj"> sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come </span><i class="wj">and</i><span class="wj"> follow me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-640'>[22] <span>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</span></div>

<div id='verse-641'>[23] <span>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-642'>[24] <span class="wj">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-643'>[25] <span>When his disciples heard </span><i>it</i><span>, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</span></div>

<div id='verse-644'>[26] <span>But Jesus beheld </span><i>them</i><span>, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</span></div>

<div id='verse-645'>[27] <span>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</span></div>

<div id='verse-646'>[28] <span>And Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-647'>[29] <span class="wj">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-650'>[2] <span class="wj">And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span></div>

<div id='verse-651'>[3] <span class="wj">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</span></div>

<div id='verse-661'>[13] <span class="wj">But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</span></div>

<div id='verse-662'>[14] <span class="wj">Take </span><i class="wj">that</i><span class="wj"> thine </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj">, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-670'>[22] <span>But Jesus answered and said, </span><span class="wj">Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span><span> They say unto him, We are able.</span></div>

<div id='verse-671'>[23] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but </span><i class="wj">it shall be given to them</i><span class="wj"> for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-674'>[26] <span class="wj">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</span></div>

<div id='verse-675'>[27] <span class="wj">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</span></div>

<div id='verse-676'>[28] <span class="wj">Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span></div>

<div id='verse-688'>[6] <span>And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</span></div>

<div id='verse-689'>[7] <span>And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set </span><i>him</i><span> thereon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-690'>[8] <span>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed </span><i>them</i><span> in the way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-691'>[9] <span>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-692'>[10] <span>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</span></div>

<div id='verse-693'>[11] <span>And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-694'>[12] <span>And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</span></div>

<div id='verse-695'>[13] <span>And said unto them, </span><span class="wj">It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-696'>[14] <span>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-697'>[15] <span>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,</span></div>

<div id='verse-698'>[16] <span>And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</span></div>

<div id='verse-699'>[17] <span>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-700'>[18] <span>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-701'>[19] <span>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, </span><span class="wj">Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</span><span> And presently the fig tree withered away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-702'>[20] <span>And when the disciples saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span></div>

<div id='verse-703'>[21] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this </span><i class="wj">which is done</i><span class="wj"> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-704'>[22] <span class="wj">And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span></div>

<div id='verse-705'>[23] <span>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</span></div>

<div id='verse-706'>[24] <span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-707'>[25] <span class="wj">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?</span><span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-708'>[26] <span>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-709'>[27] <span>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-710'>[28] <span class="wj">But what think ye? A </span><i class="wj">certain</i><span class="wj"> man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span></div>

<div id='verse-711'>[29] <span class="wj">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span></div>

<div id='verse-712'>[30] <span class="wj">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I </span><i class="wj">go</i><span class="wj">, sir: and went not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-713'>[31] <span class="wj">Whether of them twain did the will of </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> father?</span><span> They say unto him, The first.

<div id='verse-714'>[32] <span class="wj">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-715'>[33] <span class="wj">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</span></div>

<div id='verse-716'>[34] <span class="wj">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-717'>[35] <span class="wj">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span></div>

<div id='verse-718'>[36] <span class="wj">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</span></div>

<div id='verse-719'>[37] <span class="wj">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span></div>

<div id='verse-720'>[38] <span class="wj">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-721'>[39] <span class="wj">And they caught him, and cast </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> out of the vineyard, and slew </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>

<div id='verse-722'>[40] <span class="wj">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span></div>

<div id='verse-723'>[41] <span>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out </span><i>his</i><span> vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-724'>[42] <span>Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span></div>

<div id='verse-725'>[43] <span class="wj">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-726'>[44] <span class="wj">And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span></div>

<div id='verse-727'>[45] <span>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-728'>[46] <span>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-729'>[1] <span>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</span></div>

<div id='verse-730'>[2] <span class="wj">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</span></div>

<div id='verse-731'>[3] <span class="wj">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-732'>[4] <span class="wj">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and </span><i class="wj">my</i><span class="wj"> fatlings </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> killed, and all things </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> ready: come unto the marriage.</span></div>

<div id='verse-733'>[5] <span class="wj">But they made light of </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</span></div>

<div id='verse-734'>[6] <span class="wj">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> spitefully, and slew </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>

<div id='verse-735'>[7] <span class="wj">But when the king heard </span><i class="wj">thereof</i><span class="wj">, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-736'>[8] <span class="wj">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-737'>[9] <span class="wj">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</span></div>

<div id='verse-738'>[10] <span class="wj">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</span></div>

<div id='verse-739'>[11] <span class="wj">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</span></div>

<div id='verse-740'>[12] <span class="wj">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span></div>

<div id='verse-741'>[13] <span class="wj">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-742'>[14] <span class="wj">For many are called, but few </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> chosen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-743'>[15] <span>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in </span><i>his</i><span> talk.</span></div>

<div id='verse-744'>[16] <span>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any </span><i>man</i><span>: for thou regardest not the person of men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-745'>[17] <span>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</span></div>

<div id='verse-746'>[18] <span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, </span><span class="wj">Why tempt ye me, </span><i class="wj">ye</i><span class="wj"> hypocrites?</span></div>

<div id='verse-747'>[19] <span class="wj">Shew me the tribute money.</span><span> And they brought unto him a penny.</span></div>

<div id='verse-748'>[20] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Whose </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> this image and superscription?</span></div>

<div id='verse-749'>[21] <span>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, </span><span class="wj">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.</span></div>

<div id='verse-750'>[22] <span>When they had heard </span><i>these words</i><span>, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-751'>[23] <span>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-752'>[24] <span>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-753'>[25] <span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</span></div>

<div id='verse-754'>[26] <span>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-755'>[27] <span>And last of all the woman died also.</span></div>

<div id='verse-756'>[28] <span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-757'>[29] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-758'>[30] <span class="wj">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-759'>[31] <span class="wj">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-760'>[32] <span class="wj">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span></div>

<div id='verse-761'>[33] <span>And when the multitude heard </span><i>this</i><span>, they were astonished at his doctrine.</span></div>

<div id='verse-762'>[34] <span>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</span></div>

<div id='verse-763'>[35] <span>Then one of them, </span><i>which was</i><span> a lawyer, asked </span><i>him a question</i><span>, tempting him, and saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-764'>[36] <span>Master, which </span><i>is</i><span> the great commandment in the law?</span></div>

<div id='verse-765'>[37] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span></div>

<div id='verse-766'>[38] <span class="wj">This is the first and great commandment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-767'>[39] <span class="wj">And the second </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-768'>[40] <span class="wj">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-769'>[41] <span>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span></div>

<div id='verse-770'>[42] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?</span><span> They say unto him, </span><i>The Son</i><span> of David.</span></div>

<div id='verse-771'>[43] <span>He saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</span></div>

<div id='verse-772'>[44] <span class="wj">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span></div>

<div id='verse-773'>[45] <span class="wj">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</span></div>

<div id='verse-774'>[46] <span>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any </span><i>man</i><span> from that day forth ask him any more </span><i>questions</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-775'>[1] <span>Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</span></div>

<div id='verse-776'>[2] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</span></div>

<div id='verse-777'>[3] <span class="wj">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, </span><i class="wj">that</i><span class="wj"> observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-826'>[13] <span class="wj">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-827'>[14] <span class="wj">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-828'>[15] <span class="wj">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)</span></div>

<div id='verse-829'>[16] <span class="wj">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</span></div>

<div id='verse-830'>[17] <span class="wj">Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</span></div>

<div id='verse-832'>[19] <span class="wj">And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</span></div>

<div id='verse-833'>[20] <span class="wj">But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</span></div>

<div id='verse-834'>[21] <span class="wj">For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</span></div>

<div id='verse-835'>[22] <span class="wj">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-836'>[23] <span class="wj">Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> Christ, or there; believe </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-837'>[24] <span class="wj">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if </span><i class="wj">it were</i><span class="wj"> possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</span></div>

<div id='verse-838'>[25] <span class="wj">Behold, I have told you before.</span></div>

<div id='verse-840'>[27] <span class="wj">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span></div>

<div id='verse-841'>[28] <span class="wj">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</span></div>

<div id='verse-842'>[29] <span class="wj">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</span></div>

<div id='verse-844'>[31] <span class="wj">And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span></div>

<div id='verse-845'>[32] <span class="wj">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> nigh:</span></div>

<div id='verse-851'>[38] <span class="wj">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</span></div>

<div id='verse-852'>[39] <span class="wj">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</span></div>

<div id='verse-853'>[40] <span class="wj">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-854'>[41] <span class="wj">Two </span><i class="wj">women shall be</i><span class="wj"> grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-865'>[1] <span class="wj">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-866'>[2] <span class="wj">And five of them were wise, and five </span><i class="wj">were</i><span class="wj"> foolish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-867'>[3] <span class="wj">They that </span><i class="wj">were</i><span class="wj"> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span></div>

<div id='verse-868'>[4] <span class="wj">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span></div>

<div id='verse-869'>[5] <span class="wj">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span></div>

<div id='verse-870'>[6] <span class="wj">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-871'>[7] <span class="wj">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span></div>

<div id='verse-872'>[8] <span class="wj">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-873'>[9] <span class="wj">But the wise answered, saying, </span><i class="wj">Not so</i><span class="wj">; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-874'>[10] <span class="wj">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span></div>

<div id='verse-875'>[11] <span class="wj">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-876'>[12] <span class="wj">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-877'>[13] <span class="wj">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-878'>[14] <span class="wj">For </span><i class="wj">the kingdom of heaven is</i><span class="wj"> as a man travelling into a far country, </span><i class="wj">who</i><span class="wj"> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span></div>

<div id='verse-879'>[15] <span class="wj">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span></div>

<div id='verse-880'>[16] <span class="wj">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> other five talents.</span></div>

<div id='verse-881'>[17] <span class="wj">And likewise he that </span><i class="wj">had received</i><span class="wj"> two, he also gained other two.</span></div>

<div id='verse-882'>[18] <span class="wj">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</span></div>

<div id='verse-883'>[19] <span class="wj">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-884'>[20] <span class="wj">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-885'>[21] <span class="wj">His lord said unto him, Well done, </span><i class="wj">thou</i><span class="wj"> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-886'>[22] <span class="wj">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-887'>[23] <span class="wj">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-888'>[24] <span class="wj">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span></div>

<div id='verse-889'>[25] <span class="wj">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, </span><i class="wj">there</i><span class="wj"> thou hast </span><i class="wj">that is</i><span class="wj"> thine.</span></div>

<div id='verse-890'>[26] <span class="wj">His lord answered and said unto him, </span><i class="wj">Thou</i><span class="wj"> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span></div>

<div id='verse-891'>[27] <span class="wj">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and </span><i class="wj">then</i><span class="wj"> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span></div>

<div id='verse-892'>[28] <span class="wj">Take therefore the talent from him, and give </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> unto him which hath ten talents.</span></div>

<div id='verse-893'>[29] <span class="wj">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-894'>[30] <span class="wj">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-895'>[31] <span class="wj">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span></div>

<div id='verse-896'>[32] <span class="wj">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> sheep from the goats:</span></div>

<div id='verse-897'>[33] <span class="wj">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-898'>[34] <span class="wj">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span></div>

<div id='verse-899'>[35] <span class="wj">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span></div>

<div id='verse-901'>[37] <span class="wj">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj">? or thirsty, and gave </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj"> drink?</span></div>

<div id='verse-902'>[38] <span class="wj">When saw we thee a stranger, and took </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj"> in? or naked, and clothed </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj">?</span></div>

<div id='verse-903'>[39] <span class="wj">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-904'>[40] <span class="wj">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> unto me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-905'>[41] <span class="wj">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span></div>

<div id='verse-906'>[42] <span class="wj">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span></div>

<div id='verse-907'>[43] <span class="wj">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span></div>

<div id='verse-908'>[44] <span class="wj">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-909'>[45] <span class="wj">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> not to one of the least of these, ye did </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> not to me.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-911'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</span></div>

<div id='verse-912'>[2] <span class="wj">Ye know that after two days is </span><i class="wj">the feast of</i><span class="wj"> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-913'>[3] <span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span></div>

<div id='verse-914'>[4] <span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-915'>[5] <span>But they said, Not on the feast </span><i>day</i><span>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-916'>[6] <span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span></div>

<div id='verse-917'>[7] <span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat </span><i>at meat</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-918'>[8] <span>But when his disciples saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose </span><i>is</i><span> this waste?</span></div>

<div id='verse-919'>[9] <span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-920'>[10] <span>When Jesus understood </span><i>it</i><span>, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-921'>[11] <span class="wj">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span></div>

<div id='verse-922'>[12] <span class="wj">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> for my burial.</span></div>

<div id='verse-923'>[13] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, </span><i class="wj">there</i><span class="wj"> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-924'>[14] <span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span></div>

<div id='verse-925'>[15] <span>And said </span><i>unto them</i><span>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span></div>

<div id='verse-926'>[16] <span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-927'>[17] <span>Now the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the </span><i>feast of</i><span> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span></div>

<div id='verse-928'>[18] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span></div>

<div id='verse-929'>[19] <span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span></div>

<div id='verse-930'>[20] <span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span></div>

<div id='verse-931'>[21] <span>And as they did eat, he said, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-932'>[22] <span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span></div>

<div id='verse-933'>[23] <span>And he answered and said, </span><span class="wj">He that dippeth </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-934'>[24] <span class="wj">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span></div>

<div id='verse-935'>[25] <span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou hast said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-936'>[26] <span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed </span><i>it</i><span>, and brake </span><i>it</i><span>, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> to the disciples, and said, </span><span class="wj">Take, eat; this is my body.</span></div>

<div id='verse-937'>[27] <span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave </span><i>it</i><span> to them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Drink ye all of it;</span></div>

<div id='verse-938'>[28] <span class="wj">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-939'>[29] <span class="wj">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-940'>[30] <span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span></div>

<div id='verse-941'>[31] <span>Then saith Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span></div>

<div id='verse-942'>[32] <span class="wj">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-943'>[33] <span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all </span><i>men</i><span> shall be offended because of thee, </span><i>yet</i><span> will I never be offended.</span></div>

<div id='verse-944'>[34] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></div>

<div id='verse-945'>[35] <span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span></div>

<div id='verse-946'>[36] <span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, </span><span class="wj">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span></div>

<div id='verse-947'>[37] <span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-948'>[38] <span>Then saith he unto them, </span><span class="wj">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-949'>[39] <span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, </span><span class="wj">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou </span><i class="wj">wilt</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>

<div id='verse-950'>[40] <span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, </span><span class="wj">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span></div>

<div id='verse-951'>[41] <span class="wj">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> willing, but the flesh </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> weak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-952'>[42] <span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, </span><span class="wj">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-953'>[43] <span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-954'>[44] <span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span></div>

<div id='verse-955'>[45] <span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Sleep on now, and take </span><i class="wj">your</i><span class="wj"> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div>

<div id='verse-956'>[46] <span class="wj">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-957'>[47] <span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-958'>[48] <span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-959'>[49] <span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-960'>[50] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span><span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-961'>[51] <span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-962'>[52] <span>Then said Jesus unto him, </span><span class="wj">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span></div>

<div id='verse-963'>[53] <span class="wj">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></div>

<div id='verse-964'>[54] <span class="wj">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span></div>

<div id='verse-965'>[55] <span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, </span><span class="wj">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-966'>[56] <span class="wj">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span><span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-967'>[57] <span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led </span><i>him</i><span> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-968'>[58] <span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-969'>[59] <span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span></div>

<div id='verse-970'>[60] <span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, </span><i>yet</i><span> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</span></div>

<div id='verse-971'>[61] <span>And said, This </span><i>fellow</i><span> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-972'>[62] <span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what </span><i>is it which</i><span> these witness against thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-973'>[63] <span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-974'>[64] <span>Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-975'>[65] <span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-976'>[66] <span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-977'>[67] <span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote </span><i>him</i><span> with the palms of their hands,</span></div>

<div id='verse-978'>[68] <span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-979'>[69] <span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-980'>[70] <span>But he denied before </span><i>them</i><span> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-981'>[71] <span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another </span><i>maid</i><span> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This </span><i>fellow</i><span> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-982'>[72] <span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-983'>[73] <span>And after a while came unto </span><i>him</i><span> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art </span><i>one</i><span> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-984'>[74] <span>Then began he to curse and to swear, </span><i>saying</i><span>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span></div>

<div id='verse-985'>[75] <span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-27'>
<h2>Chapter 27</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-986'>[1] <span>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</span></div>

<div id='verse-987'>[2] <span>And when they had bound him, they led </span><i>him</i><span> away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-988'>[3] <span>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</span></div>

<div id='verse-989'>[4] <span>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What </span><i>is that</i><span> to us? see thou </span><i>to that</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-990'>[5] <span>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-991'>[6] <span>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-992'>[7] <span>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-993'>[8] <span>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-994'>[9] <span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</span></div>

<div id='verse-995'>[10] <span>And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-996'>[11] <span>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou sayest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-997'>[12] <span>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-998'>[13] <span>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</span></div>

<div id='verse-999'>[14] <span>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1000'>[15] <span>Now at </span><i>that</i><span> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1001'>[16] <span>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1002'>[17] <span>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</span></div>

<div id='verse-1003'>[18] <span>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1004'>[19] <span>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1005'>[20] <span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1006'>[21] <span>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1007'>[22] <span>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? </span><i>They</i><span> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1008'>[23] <span>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1009'>[24] <span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but </span><i>that</i><span> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed </span><i>his</i><span> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye </span><i>to it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1010'>[25] <span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood </span><i>be</i><span> on us, and on our children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1011'>[26] <span>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered </span><i>him</i><span> to be crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1012'>[27] <span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band </span><i>of soldiers</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1013'>[28] <span>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1014'>[29] <span>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put </span><i>it</i><span> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span></div>

<div id='verse-1015'>[30] <span>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1016'>[31] <span>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1017'>[32] <span>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1018'>[33] <span>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1019'>[34] <span>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted </span><i>thereof</i><span>, he would not drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1020'>[35] <span>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1021'>[36] <span>And sitting down they watched him there;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1022'>[37] <span>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1023'>[38] <span>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1024'>[39] <span>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1025'>[40] <span>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest </span><i>it</i><span> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1026'>[41] <span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking </span><i>him</i><span>, with the scribes and elders, said,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1027'>[42] <span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1028'>[43] <span>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1029'>[44] <span>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1030'>[45] <span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1031'>[46] <span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, </span><span class="wj">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</span><span> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span></div>

<div id='verse-1032'>[47] <span>Some of them that stood there, when they heard </span><i>that</i><span>, said, This </span><i>man</i><span> calleth for Elias.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1033'>[48] <span>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled </span><i>it</i><span> with vinegar, and put </span><i>it</i><span> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1034'>[49] <span>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1035'>[50] <span>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1036'>[51] <span>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</span></div>

<div id='verse-1037'>[52] <span>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1038'>[53] <span>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1039'>[54] <span>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1040'>[55] <span>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span></div>

<div id='verse-1041'>[56] <span>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1042'>[57] <span>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</span></div>

<div id='verse-1043'>[58] <span>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1044'>[59] <span>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1045'>[60] <span>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1046'>[61] <span>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1047'>[62] <span>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1048'>[63] <span>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1049'>[64] <span>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1050'>[65] <span>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make </span><i>it</i><span> as sure as ye can.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1051'>[66] <span>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1052'>[1] <span>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1053'>[2] <span>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1054'>[3] <span>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span></div>

<div id='verse-1055'>[4] <span>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead </span><i>men</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1056'>[5] <span>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1057'>[6] <span>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1058'>[7] <span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1059'>[8] <span>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1060'>[9] <span>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, </span><span class="wj">All hail.</span><span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1061'>[10] <span>Then said Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1062'>[11] <span>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1063'>[12] <span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span></div>

<div id='verse-1064'>[13] <span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him </span><i>away</i><span> while we slept.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1065'>[14] <span>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1066'>[15] <span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1067'>[16] <span>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1068'>[17] <span>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1069'>[18] <span>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-1070'>[19] <span class="wj">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span></div>

<div id='verse-1071'>[20] <span class="wj">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, </span><i class="wj">even</i><span class="wj"> unto the end of the world.</span><span> Amen.</span></div>
