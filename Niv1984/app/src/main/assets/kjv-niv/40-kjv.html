<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-26-2'><i>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-26-3'><i>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-26-5'><i>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-26-6'><i>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-26-7'><i>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-26-12'><i>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-26-13'><i>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</i>
