<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> --which means, "God with us."</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but </span><i>that</i><span> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed </span><i>his</i><span> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye </span><i>to it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood </span><i>be</i><span> on us, and on our children.</span></div>
