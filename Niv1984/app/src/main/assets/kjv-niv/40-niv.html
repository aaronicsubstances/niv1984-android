<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> was to be born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-493'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-499'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-500'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-688'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-689'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, `Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"`Because no one has hired us,' they answered. "He said to them, `You also go and work in my vineyard.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, `Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-698'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>`These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, `and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-707'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-710'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-711'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>"Lord," they answered, "we want our sight."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-744'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, `Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-747'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-962'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-964'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-965'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-966'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-967'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-968'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-969'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-970'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-971'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-972'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-973'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-975'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Then one of the Twelve--the one called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief priests</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-976'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty silver coins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-977'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-978'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-980'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-981'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-982'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-983'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely not I, Lord?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-986'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-987'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-988'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-989'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>This is my blood of the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-2" id="niv-verse-26-2">b</a>]</sup><span> covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-991'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-992'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-3" id="niv-verse-26-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-993'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-994'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-995'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-996'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-997'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-998'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-999'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1000'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1001'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1002'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1010'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1011'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-4" id="niv-verse-26-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1013'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1014'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1015'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1016'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1017'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1018'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1019'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1020'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1021'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1022'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>and declared, "This fellow said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1023'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1024'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-5" id="niv-verse-26-5">e</a>]</sup><span> the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1025'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1026'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1027'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1028'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1029'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>and said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1030'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1031'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1032'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1033'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1034'><span class='verse-num'>[73]</span> <span>After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1035'><span class='verse-num'>[74]</span> <span>Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1036'><span class='verse-num'>[75]</span> <span>Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1038'>Chapter 27</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1039'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1040'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1041'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1042'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1043'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1044'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1045'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1046'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1047'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1048'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-1" id="niv-verse-27-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1049'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1050'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1051'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1052'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1053'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1054'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1055'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1056'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1057'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1058'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1059'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1060'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1061'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1062'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1063'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1064'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1065'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1066'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1067'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1068'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1069'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1070'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1071'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1072'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1073'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-2" id="niv-verse-27-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1074'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1075'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1076'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1077'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1078'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1079'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1080'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1081'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, `I am the Son of God.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1082'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1083'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1084'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-3" id="niv-verse-27-3">c</a>]</sup><span> lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-4" id="niv-verse-27-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1085'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1086'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1087'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1088'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1089'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1090'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1091'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1092'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-5" id="niv-verse-27-5">e</a>]</sup><span> of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1093'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1094'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1095'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1096'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1097'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1098'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1099'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1100'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1101'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, `After three days I will rise again.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1102'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1103'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1104'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1107'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1108'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1109'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1110'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1111'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1112'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1113'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: `He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1114'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1115'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1116'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1117'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1118'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,</span></div>
