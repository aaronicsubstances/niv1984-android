<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> --</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>I baptize you with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And there came a voice from heaven, </span><i>saying</i><span>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And saying, </span><span class="wj">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>At once they left their nets and followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the </span><i>son</i><span> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">5</a>]</sup><span> spirit cried out,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Saying, Let </span><i>us</i><span> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, </span><span class="wj">Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine </span><i>is</i><span> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>The whole town gathered at the door,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Simon and his companions went to look for him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All </span><i>men</i><span> seek for thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>A man with leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">6</a>]</sup><span> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">I will; be thou clean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>And saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[45] <span>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[45] <span>But he went out, and began to publish </span><i>it</i><span> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And again he entered into Capernaum after </span><i>some</i><span> days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive </span><i>them</i><span>, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken </span><i>it</i><span> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, </span><span class="wj">Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Why doth this </span><i>man</i><span> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up, take your mat and walk'?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span class="wj">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, </span><i class="wj">Thy</i><span class="wj"> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span class="wj">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</span><span> (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span class="wj">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the </span><i>son</i><span> of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Follow me.</span><span> And he arose and followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>When Jesus heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span class="wj">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span class="wj">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span class="wj">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span class="wj">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span class="wj">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span class="wj">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <i class="wj">It is</i><span class="wj"> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span class="wj">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Let us pass over unto the other side.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, </span><span class="wj">Peace, be still.</span><span> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">2</a>]</sup><span> spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Who had </span><i>his</i><span> dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any </span><i>man</i><span> tame him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, </span><i>thou</i><span> Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>For he said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Come out of the man, </span><i class="wj">thou</i><span class="wj"> unclean spirit.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And he asked him, </span><span class="wj">What </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> thy name?</span><span> And he answered, saying, My name </span><i>is</i><span> Legion: for we are many.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And they that fed the swine fled, and told </span><i>it</i><span> in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And they that saw </span><i>it</i><span> told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and </span><i>also</i><span> concerning the swine.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">3</a>]</sup><span> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all </span><i>men</i><span> did marvel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: </span><i>I pray thee</i><span>, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And </span><i>Jesus</i><span> went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in </span><i>her</i><span> body that she was healed of that plague.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, </span><span class="wj">Who touched my clothes?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, `Who touched me?'"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And he said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's </span><i>house certain</i><span> which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, </span><span class="wj">Be not afraid, only believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And when he was come in, he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Talitha cumi;</span><span> which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was </span><i>of the age</i><span> of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing </span><i>him</i><span> were astonished, saying, From whence hath this </span><i>man</i><span> these things? and what wisdom </span><i>is</i><span> this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">2</a>]</sup><span> spirits.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And he called </span><i>unto him</i><span> the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And commanded them that they should take nothing for </span><i>their</i><span> journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in </span><i>their</i><span> purse:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But </span><i>be</i><span> shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span class="wj">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>They went out and preached that people should repent.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">3</a>]</sup><span> "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And king Herod heard </span><i>of him</i><span>; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But when Herod heard </span><i>thereof</i><span>, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">4</a>]</sup><span> ; yet he liked to listen to him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief </span><i>estates</i><span> of Galilee;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give </span><i>it</i><span> thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give </span><i>it</i><span> thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And the king was exceeding sorry; </span><i>yet</i><span> for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And when his disciples heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while:</span><span> for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time </span><i>is</i><span> far passed:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-5" id="niv-verse-6-5">5</a>]</sup><span> ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>He answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Give ye them to eat.</span><span> And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>He saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">How many loaves have ye? go and see.</span><span> And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave </span><i>them</i><span> to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>They all ate and were satisfied,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>And they did all eat, and were filled.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[45] <span>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[45] <span>And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[46] <span>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[46] <span>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[47] <span>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[47] <span>And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[48] <span>He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[48] <span>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[49] <span>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[49] <span>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[50] <span>because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[50] <span>For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[51] <span>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[51] <span>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[52] <span>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[52] <span>For they considered not </span><i>the miracle</i><span> of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[53] <span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[53] <span>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[54] <span>As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[54] <span>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[55] <span>They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[55] <span>And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[56] <span>And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[56] <span>And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash </span><i>their</i><span> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">1</a>]</sup><span> )</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And </span><i>when they come</i><span> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, </span><i>as</i><span> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with `unclean' hands?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "`These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span class="wj">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these </span><i>men</i><span> with bread here in the wilderness?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried </span><i>him</i><span> away, and delivered </span><i>him</i><span> to Pilate.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou sayest </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Now at </span><i>that</i><span> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire </span><i>him to do</i><span> as he had ever done unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</span></div></div>
