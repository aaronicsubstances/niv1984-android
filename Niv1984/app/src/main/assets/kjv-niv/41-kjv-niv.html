<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-6-14'><b>(NIV)</b> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying,

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-6-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-6-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-6-16'><b>(NIV)</b> But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"

<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-6-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-6-17'><b>(NIV)</b> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-6-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-6-18'><b>(NIV)</b> For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-6-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-6-22'><b>(NIV)</b> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."

<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-6-22'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-6-23'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-6-24'><b>(NIV)</b> She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-6-24'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-6-25'><b>(NIV)</b> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."

<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-6-25'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-6-26'><b>(NIV)</b> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-6-26'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-6-27'><b>(NIV)</b> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='27'><li id='kverse-6-27'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-6-28'><b>(NIV)</b> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='28'><li id='kverse-6-28'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-6-29'><b>(NIV)</b> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
