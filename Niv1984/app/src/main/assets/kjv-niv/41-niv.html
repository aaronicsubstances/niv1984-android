<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> --</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>"a voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>I baptize you with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>At once they left their nets and followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> spirit cried out,</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[26] <span>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[27] <span>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[28] <span>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[29] <span>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[30] <span>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[31] <span>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[32] <span>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[33] <span>The whole town gathered at the door,</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[34] <span>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[35] <span>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[36] <span>Simon and his companions went to look for him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[37] <span>and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[38] <span>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[39] <span>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[40] <span>A man with leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[41] <span>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[42] <span>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[43] <span>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[44] <span>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[45] <span>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-46'>[1] <span>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[2] <span>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[3] <span>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[4] <span>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[5] <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[6] <span>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[7] <span>"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[8] <span>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[9] <span>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up, take your mat and walk'?</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[10] <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[11] <span>"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[12] <span>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[13] <span>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[14] <span>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[15] <span>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[16] <span>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[17] <span>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[18] <span>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[19] <span>Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[20] <span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[21] <span>"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[22] <span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[23] <span>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[24] <span>The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[25] <span>He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[26] <span>In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[27] <span>Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[28] <span>So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</span></div>

<div id='chapter-3'>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-74'>[1] <span>Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[2] <span>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[3] <span>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[4] <span>Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[5] <span>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[6] <span>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[7] <span>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[8] <span>When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[9] <span>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[10] <span>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[11] <span>Whenever the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[12] <span>But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[13] <span>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[14] <span>He appointed twelve--designating them apostles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[15] <span>and to have authority to drive out demons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[16] <span>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[17] <span>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[18] <span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[19] <span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[20] <span>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[21] <span>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[22] <span>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[23] <span>So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[24] <span>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[25] <span>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[26] <span>And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[27] <span>In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[28] <span>I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[29] <span>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[30] <span>He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[31] <span>Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[32] <span>A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[33] <span>"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[34] <span>Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[35] <span>Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-109'>[1] <span>Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[2] <span>He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:</span></div>

<div id='verse-111'>[3] <span>"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-112'>[4] <span>As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-113'>[5] <span>Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</span></div>

<div id='verse-114'>[6] <span>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</span></div>

<div id='verse-115'>[7] <span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-116'>[8] <span>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."</span></div>

<div id='verse-117'>[9] <span>Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>

<div id='verse-118'>[10] <span>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</span></div>

<div id='verse-119'>[11] <span>He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</span></div>

<div id='verse-120'>[12] <span>so that, "`they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-121'>[13] <span>Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</span></div>

<div id='verse-122'>[14] <span>The farmer sows the word.</span></div>

<div id='verse-123'>[15] <span>Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-124'>[16] <span>Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-125'>[17] <span>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-126'>[18] <span>Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</span></div>

<div id='verse-127'>[19] <span>but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[20] <span>Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[21] <span>He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</span></div>

<div id='verse-130'>[22] <span>For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</span></div>

<div id='verse-131'>[23] <span>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[24] <span>"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-133'>[25] <span>Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."</span></div>

<div id='verse-134'>[26] <span>He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[27] <span>Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[28] <span>All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[29] <span>As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</span></div>

<div id='verse-138'>[30] <span>Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</span></div>

<div id='verse-139'>[31] <span>It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[32] <span>Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[33] <span>With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-142'>[34] <span>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</span></div>

<div id='verse-143'>[35] <span>That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[36] <span>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[37] <span>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[38] <span>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[39] <span>He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[40] <span>He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[41] <span>They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-150'>[1] <span>They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-151'>[2] <span>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[3] <span>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[4] <span>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[5] <span>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[6] <span>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[7] <span>He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[8] <span>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[9] <span>Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[10] <span>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[11] <span>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[12] <span>The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[13] <span>He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[14] <span>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[15] <span>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[16] <span>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[17] <span>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[18] <span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[19] <span>Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[20] <span>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[21] <span>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[22] <span>Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[23] <span>and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[24] <span>So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[25] <span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[26] <span>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[27] <span>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[28] <span>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[29] <span>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</span></div>

<div id='verse-179'>[30] <span>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-180'>[31] <span>"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, `Who touched me?'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-181'>[32] <span>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[33] <span>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[34] <span>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[35] <span>While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[36] <span>Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</span></div>

<div id='verse-186'>[37] <span>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</span></div>

<div id='verse-187'>[38] <span>When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-188'>[39] <span>He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</span></div>

<div id='verse-189'>[40] <span>But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</span></div>

<div id='verse-190'>[41] <span>He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[42] <span>Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[43] <span>He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-193'>[1] <span>Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.</span></div>

<div id='verse-194'>[2] <span>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[3] <span>Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[4] <span>Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."</span></div>

<div id='verse-197'>[5] <span>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-198'>[6] <span>And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</span></div>

<div id='verse-199'>[7] <span>Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-200'>[8] <span>These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-201'>[9] <span>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</span></div>

<div id='verse-202'>[10] <span>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</span></div>

<div id='verse-203'>[11] <span>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[12] <span>They went out and preached that people should repent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[13] <span>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-206'>[14] <span>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</span></div>

<div id='verse-207'>[15] <span>Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[16] <span>But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-209'>[17] <span>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</span></div>

<div id='verse-210'>[18] <span>For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span></div>

<div id='verse-211'>[19] <span>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</span></div>

<div id='verse-212'>[20] <span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ; yet he liked to listen to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-213'>[21] <span>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-214'>[22] <span>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-215'>[23] <span>And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</span></div>

<div id='verse-216'>[24] <span>She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-217'>[25] <span>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span></div>

<div id='verse-218'>[26] <span>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-219'>[27] <span>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</span></div>

<div id='verse-220'>[28] <span>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-221'>[29] <span>On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</span></div>

<div id='verse-222'>[30] <span>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</span></div>

<div id='verse-223'>[31] <span>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</span></div>

<div id='verse-224'>[32] <span>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-225'>[33] <span>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-226'>[34] <span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-227'>[35] <span>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</span></div>

<div id='verse-228'>[36] <span>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</span></div>

<div id='verse-229'>[37] <span>But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-5" id="niv-verse-6-5">e</a>]</sup><span> ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-230'>[38] <span>"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."</span></div>

<div id='verse-231'>[39] <span>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-232'>[40] <span>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</span></div>

<div id='verse-233'>[41] <span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-234'>[42] <span>They all ate and were satisfied,</span></div>

<div id='verse-235'>[43] <span>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-236'>[44] <span>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-237'>[45] <span>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</span></div>

<div id='verse-238'>[46] <span>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</span></div>

<div id='verse-239'>[47] <span>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</span></div>

<div id='verse-240'>[48] <span>He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</span></div>

<div id='verse-241'>[49] <span>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</span></div>

<div id='verse-242'>[50] <span>because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</span></div>

<div id='verse-243'>[51] <span>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</span></div>

<div id='verse-244'>[52] <span>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-245'>[53] <span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-246'>[54] <span>As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-247'>[55] <span>They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</span></div>

<div id='verse-248'>[56] <span>And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-249'>[1] <span>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</span></div>

<div id='verse-250'>[2] <span>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-251'>[3] <span>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span></div>

<div id='verse-252'>[4] <span>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> )</span></div>

<div id='verse-253'>[5] <span>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with `unclean' hands?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-254'>[6] <span>He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "`These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[7] <span>They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-256'>[8] <span>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."</span></div>

<div id='verse-257'>[9] <span>And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> your own traditions!</span></div>

<div id='verse-258'>[10] <span>For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother,' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and, `Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-5" id="niv-verse-7-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-259'>[11] <span>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: `Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),</span></div>

<div id='verse-260'>[12] <span>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-261'>[13] <span>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[14] <span>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</span></div>

<div id='verse-263'>[15] <span>Nothing outside a man can make him `unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him `unclean.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-6" id="niv-verse-7-6">f</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-264'>[16] </div>

<div id='verse-265'>[17] <span>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</span></div>

<div id='verse-266'>[18] <span>"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him `unclean'?</span></div>

<div id='verse-267'>[19] <span>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")</span></div>

<div id='verse-268'>[20] <span>He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him `unclean.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-269'>[21] <span>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</span></div>

<div id='verse-270'>[22] <span>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[23] <span>All these evils come from inside and make a man `unclean.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-272'>[24] <span>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-7" id="niv-verse-7-7">g</a>]</sup><span> He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[25] <span>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-8" id="niv-verse-7-8">h</a>]</sup><span> spirit came and fell at his feet.</span></div>

<div id='verse-274'>[26] <span>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span></div>

<div id='verse-275'>[27] <span>"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[28] <span>"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</span></div>

<div id='verse-277'>[29] <span>Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</span></div>

<div id='verse-278'>[30] <span>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-279'>[31] <span>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-9" id="niv-verse-7-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-280'>[32] <span>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-281'>[33] <span>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[34] <span>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[35] <span>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[36] <span>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[37] <span>People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[1] <span>During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[2] <span>"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[3] <span>If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[4] <span>His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[5] <span>"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[6] <span>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[7] <span>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[8] <span>The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[9] <span>About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[10] <span>he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</span></div>

<div id='verse-296'>[11] <span>The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[12] <span>He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[13] <span>Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[14] <span>The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[15] <span>"Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[16] <span>They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[17] <span>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</span></div>

<div id='verse-303'>[18] <span>Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?</span></div>

<div id='verse-304'>[19] <span>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-305'>[20] <span>"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."</span></div>

<div id='verse-306'>[21] <span>He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-307'>[22] <span>They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-308'>[23] <span>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-309'>[24] <span>He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."</span></div>

<div id='verse-310'>[25] <span>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-311'>[26] <span>Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-312'>[27] <span>Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-313'>[28] <span>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."</span></div>

<div id='verse-314'>[29] <span>"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-315'>[30] <span>Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-316'>[31] <span>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-317'>[32] <span>He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-318'>[33] <span>But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."</span></div>

<div id='verse-319'>[34] <span>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-320'>[35] <span>For whoever wants to save his life </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-321'>[36] <span>What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?</span></div>

<div id='verse-322'>[37] <span>Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</span></div>

<div id='verse-323'>[38] <span>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-324'>[1] <span>And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."</span></div>

<div id='verse-325'>[2] <span>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-326'>[3] <span>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-327'>[4] <span>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-328'>[5] <span>Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</span></div>

<div id='verse-329'>[6] <span>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-330'>[7] <span>Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-331'>[8] <span>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-332'>[9] <span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-333'>[10] <span>They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.</span></div>

<div id='verse-334'>[11] <span>And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-335'>[12] <span>Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</span></div>

<div id='verse-336'>[13] <span>But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."</span></div>

<div id='verse-337'>[14] <span>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-338'>[15] <span>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-339'>[16] <span>"What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.</span></div>

<div id='verse-340'>[17] <span>A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.</span></div>

<div id='verse-341'>[18] <span>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."</span></div>

<div id='verse-342'>[19] <span>"O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-343'>[20] <span>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-344'>[21] <span>Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-345'>[22] <span>"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-346'>[23] <span>"`If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."</span></div>

<div id='verse-347'>[24] <span>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-348'>[25] <span>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."</span></div>

<div id='verse-349'>[26] <span>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."</span></div>

<div id='verse-350'>[27] <span>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-351'>[28] <span>After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-352'>[29] <span>He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-353'>[30] <span>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,</span></div>

<div id='verse-354'>[31] <span>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."</span></div>

<div id='verse-355'>[32] <span>But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-356'>[33] <span>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-357'>[34] <span>But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-358'>[35] <span>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."</span></div>

<div id='verse-359'>[36] <span>He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</span></div>

<div id='verse-360'>[37] <span>"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-361'>[38] <span>"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."</span></div>

<div id='verse-362'>[39] <span>"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</span></div>

<div id='verse-363'>[40] <span>for whoever is not against us is for us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-364'>[41] <span>I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[42] <span>"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.</span></div>

<div id='verse-366'>[43] <span>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-3" id="niv-verse-9-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-367'>[44] </div>

<div id='verse-369'>[46] </div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-374'>[1] <span>Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-375'>[2] <span>Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[3] <span>"What did Moses command you?" he replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-377'>[4] <span>They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[5] <span>"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[6] <span>"But at the beginning of creation God `made them male and female.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-380'>[7] <span>`For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-381'>[8] <span>and the two will become one flesh.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-3" id="niv-verse-10-3">c</a>]</sup><span> So they are no longer two, but one.</span></div>

<div id='verse-382'>[9] <span>Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."</span></div>

<div id='verse-383'>[10] <span>When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</span></div>

<div id='verse-384'>[11] <span>He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[12] <span>And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</span></div>

<div id='verse-386'>[13] <span>People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[14] <span>When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[15] <span>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[16] <span>And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[17] <span>As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-391'>[18] <span>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[19] <span>You know the commandments: `Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-4" id="niv-verse-10-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[20] <span>"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[21] <span>Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-395'>[22] <span>At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[23] <span>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-397'>[24] <span>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">e</a>]</sup><span> to enter the kingdom of God!</span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[25] <span>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span></div>

<div id='verse-399'>[26] <span>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[27] <span>Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</span></div>

<div id='verse-401'>[28] <span>Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-402'>[29] <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</span></div>

<div id='verse-403'>[30] <span>will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-404'>[31] <span>But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</span></div>

<div id='verse-405'>[32] <span>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-406'>[33] <span>"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</span></div>

<div id='verse-407'>[34] <span>who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</span></div>

<div id='verse-408'>[35] <span>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</span></div>

<div id='verse-409'>[36] <span>"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</span></div>

<div id='verse-410'>[37] <span>They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</span></div>

<div id='verse-411'>[38] <span>"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-412'>[39] <span>"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</span></div>

<div id='verse-413'>[40] <span>but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</span></div>

<div id='verse-414'>[41] <span>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</span></div>

<div id='verse-415'>[42] <span>Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-416'>[43] <span>Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</span></div>

<div id='verse-417'>[44] <span>and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-418'>[45] <span>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span></div>

<div id='verse-419'>[46] <span>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</span></div>

<div id='verse-420'>[47] <span>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-421'>[48] <span>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-422'>[49] <span>Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</span></div>

<div id='verse-423'>[50] <span>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-424'>[51] <span>"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."</span></div>

<div id='verse-425'>[52] <span>"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</span></div>

<div id='verse-428'>[3] <span>If anyone asks you, `Why are you doing this?' tell him, `The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-429'>[4] <span>They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</span></div>

<div id='verse-430'>[5] <span>some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-431'>[6] <span>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</span></div>

<div id='verse-432'>[7] <span>When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-433'>[8] <span>Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</span></div>

<div id='verse-434'>[9] <span>Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> " "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-435'>[10] <span>"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-436'>[11] <span>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span></div>

<div id='verse-437'>[12] <span>The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-438'>[13] <span>Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</span></div>

<div id='verse-439'>[14] <span>Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-440'>[15] <span>On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,</span></div>

<div id='verse-441'>[16] <span>and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-442'>[17] <span>And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: "`My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ? But you have made it `a den of robbers.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-4" id="niv-verse-11-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-443'>[18] <span>The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</span></div>

<div id='verse-444'>[19] <span>When evening came, they </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-5" id="niv-verse-11-5">e</a>]</sup><span> went out of the city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-445'>[20] <span>In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</span></div>

<div id='verse-446'>[21] <span>Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-447'>[22] <span>"Have </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-6" id="niv-verse-11-6">f</a>]</sup><span> faith in God," Jesus answered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-448'>[23] <span>"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, `Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-449'>[24] <span>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span></div>

<div id='verse-450'>[25] <span>And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-7" id="niv-verse-11-7">g</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div id='verse-451'>[26] </div>

<div id='verse-452'>[27] <span>They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-453'>[28] <span>"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-454'>[29] <span>Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-455'>[30] <span>John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-456'>[31] <span>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will ask, `Then why didn't you believe him?'</span></div>

<div id='verse-457'>[32] <span>But if we say, `From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-458'>[33] <span>So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-459'>[1] <span>He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</span></div>

<div id='verse-460'>[2] <span>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span></div>

<div id='verse-461'>[3] <span>But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-462'>[4] <span>Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</span></div>

<div id='verse-463'>[5] <span>He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-464'>[6] <span>"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, `They will respect my son.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-465'>[7] <span>"But the tenants said to one another, `This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-466'>[8] <span>So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</span></div>

<div id='verse-467'>[9] <span>"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</span></div>

<div id='verse-468'>[10] <span>Haven't you read this scripture: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ;</span></div>

<div id='verse-469'>[11] <span>the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-2" id="niv-verse-12-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-470'>[12] <span>Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-471'>[13] <span>Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.</span></div>

<div id='verse-472'>[14] <span>They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?</span></div>

<div id='verse-473'>[15] <span>Should we pay or shouldn't we?" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."</span></div>

<div id='verse-474'>[16] <span>They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-475'>[17] <span>Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-476'>[18] <span>Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</span></div>

<div id='verse-477'>[19] <span>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-478'>[20] <span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-479'>[21] <span>The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</span></div>

<div id='verse-480'>[22] <span>In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</span></div>

<div id='verse-481'>[23] <span>At the resurrection </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-3" id="niv-verse-12-3">c</a>]</sup><span> whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-482'>[24] <span>Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</span></div>

<div id='verse-483'>[25] <span>When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-484'>[26] <span>Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-4" id="niv-verse-12-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>

<div id='verse-485'>[27] <span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-486'>[28] <span>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-487'>[29] <span>"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: `Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-5" id="niv-verse-12-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-488'>[30] <span>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-6" id="niv-verse-12-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-489'>[31] <span>The second is this: `Love your neighbor as yourself.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-7" id="niv-verse-12-7">g</a>]</sup><span> There is no commandment greater than these."</span></div>

<div id='verse-490'>[32] <span>"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-491'>[33] <span>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span></div>

<div id='verse-492'>[34] <span>When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</span></div>

<div id='verse-493'>[35] <span>While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-8" id="niv-verse-12-8">h</a>]</sup><span> is the son of David?</span></div>

<div id='verse-494'>[36] <span>David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-9" id="niv-verse-12-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-495'>[37] <span>David himself calls him `Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</span></div>

<div id='verse-496'>[38] <span>As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,</span></div>

<div id='verse-497'>[39] <span>and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</span></div>

<div id='verse-498'>[40] <span>They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</span></div>

<div id='verse-499'>[41] <span>Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-500'>[42] <span>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-10" id="niv-verse-12-10">j</a>]</sup><span> worth only a fraction of a penny. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-11" id="niv-verse-12-11">k</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-501'>[43] <span>Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</span></div>

<div id='verse-502'>[44] <span>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."</span></div>

<div id='verse-545'>[6] <span>"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-546'>[7] <span>The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-547'>[8] <span>She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</span></div>

<div id='verse-548'>[9] <span>I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</span></div>

<div id='verse-549'>[10] <span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-550'>[11] <span>They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</span></div>

<div id='verse-551'>[12] <span>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-552'>[13] <span>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-553'>[14] <span>Say to the owner of the house he enters, `The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span></div>

<div id='verse-554'>[15] <span>He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."</span></div>

<div id='verse-555'>[16] <span>The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</span></div>

<div id='verse-556'>[17] <span>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.</span></div>

<div id='verse-557'>[18] <span>While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</span></div>

<div id='verse-558'>[19] <span>They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-559'>[20] <span>"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-560'>[21] <span>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</span></div>

<div id='verse-561'>[22] <span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</span></div>

<div id='verse-562'>[23] <span>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-563'>[24] <span>"This is my blood of the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-2" id="niv-verse-14-2">b</a>]</sup><span> covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-564'>[25] <span>"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</span></div>

<div id='verse-565'>[26] <span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>

<div id='verse-566'>[27] <span>"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-567'>[28] <span>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</span></div>

<div id='verse-568'>[29] <span>Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."</span></div>

<div id='verse-569'>[30] <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">d</a>]</sup><span> you yourself will disown me three times."</span></div>

<div id='verse-570'>[31] <span>But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.</span></div>

<div id='verse-571'>[32] <span>They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</span></div>

<div id='verse-572'>[33] <span>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-573'>[34] <span>"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."</span></div>

<div id='verse-574'>[35] <span>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-575'>[36] <span>"Abba, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-5" id="niv-verse-14-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</span></div>

<div id='verse-576'>[37] <span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</span></div>

<div id='verse-577'>[38] <span>Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</span></div>

<div id='verse-578'>[39] <span>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-579'>[40] <span>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-580'>[41] <span>Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div>

<div id='verse-581'>[42] <span>Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-582'>[43] <span>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</span></div>

<div id='verse-583'>[44] <span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."</span></div>

<div id='verse-584'>[45] <span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-585'>[46] <span>The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-586'>[47] <span>Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-587'>[48] <span>"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</span></div>

<div id='verse-588'>[49] <span>Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."</span></div>

<div id='verse-589'>[50] <span>Then everyone deserted him and fled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-590'>[51] <span>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-591'>[52] <span>he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</span></div>

<div id='verse-592'>[53] <span>They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</span></div>

<div id='verse-593'>[54] <span>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-594'>[55] <span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</span></div>

<div id='verse-595'>[56] <span>Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</span></div>

<div id='verse-596'>[57] <span>Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</span></div>

<div id='verse-597'>[58] <span>"We heard him say, `I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-598'>[59] <span>Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</span></div>

<div id='verse-599'>[60] <span>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-600'>[61] <span>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">f</a>]</sup><span> the Son of the Blessed One?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-601'>[62] <span>"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span></div>

<div id='verse-602'>[63] <span>The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</span></div>

<div id='verse-603'>[64] <span>"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-604'>[65] <span>Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-605'>[66] <span>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</span></div>

<div id='verse-606'>[67] <span>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-607'>[68] <span>But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-608'>[69] <span>When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."</span></div>

<div id='verse-609'>[70] <span>Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</span></div>

<div id='verse-610'>[71] <span>He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."</span></div>

<div id='verse-611'>[72] <span>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">h</a>]</sup><span> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-9" id="niv-verse-14-9">i</a>]</sup><span> you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-612'>[1] <span>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</span></div>

<div id='verse-613'>[2] <span>"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div>

<div id='verse-614'>[3] <span>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-615'>[4] <span>So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</span></div>

<div id='verse-616'>[5] <span>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-617'>[6] <span>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</span></div>

<div id='verse-618'>[7] <span>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</span></div>

<div id='verse-619'>[8] <span>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</span></div>

<div id='verse-620'>[9] <span>"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</span></div>

<div id='verse-621'>[10] <span>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-622'>[11] <span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-623'>[12] <span>"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-624'>[13] <span>"Crucify him!" they shouted.</span></div>

<div id='verse-625'>[14] <span>"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-626'>[15] <span>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-627'>[16] <span>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-628'>[17] <span>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-629'>[18] <span>And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-630'>[19] <span>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-631'>[20] <span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-632'>[21] <span>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</span></div>

<div id='verse-633'>[22] <span>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</span></div>

<div id='verse-634'>[23] <span>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-635'>[24] <span>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</span></div>

<div id='verse-636'>[25] <span>It was the third hour when they crucified him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-637'>[26] <span>The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>

<div id='verse-638'>[27] <span>They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-639'>[28] </div>

<div id='verse-640'>[29] <span>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span></div>

<div id='verse-641'>[30] <span>come down from the cross and save yourself!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-642'>[31] <span>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!</span></div>

<div id='verse-643'>[32] <span>Let this Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-2" id="niv-verse-15-2">b</a>]</sup><span> this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-644'>[33] <span>At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span></div>

<div id='verse-645'>[34] <span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</span></div>

<div id='verse-646'>[35] <span>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."</span></div>

<div id='verse-647'>[36] <span>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.</span></div>

<div id='verse-648'>[37] <span>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</span></div>

<div id='verse-649'>[38] <span>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-650'>[39] <span>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-3" id="niv-verse-15-3">c</a>]</sup><span> saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-4" id="niv-verse-15-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of God!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-651'>[40] <span>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</span></div>

<div id='verse-652'>[41] <span>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-653'>[42] <span>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</span></div>

<div id='verse-654'>[43] <span>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</span></div>

<div id='verse-655'>[44] <span>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-656'>[45] <span>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</span></div>

<div id='verse-657'>[46] <span>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</span></div>

<div id='verse-658'>[47] <span>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-659'>[1] <span>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.</span></div>

<div id='verse-660'>[2] <span>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb</span></div>

<div id='verse-661'>[3] <span>and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-662'>[4] <span>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.</span></div>

<div id='verse-663'>[5] <span>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-664'>[6] <span>"Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-665'>[7] <span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-666'>[8] <span>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-667'>[9] <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup><span> When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-668'>[10] <span>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.</span></div>

<div id='verse-669'>[11] <span>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-670'>[12] <span>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.</span></div>

<div id='verse-671'>[13] <span>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.</span></div>

<div id='verse-672'>[14] <span>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-673'>[15] <span>He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-674'>[16] <span>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-675'>[17] <span>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span></div>

<div id='verse-676'>[18] <span>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."</span></div>

<div id='verse-677'>[19] <span>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.</span></div>
