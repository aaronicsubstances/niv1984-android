<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> --</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"a voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I baptize you with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>At once they left their nets and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> spirit cried out,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The whole town gathered at the door,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Simon and his companions went to look for him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>A man with leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-48'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up, take your mat and walk'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-78'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Whenever the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He appointed twelve--designating them apostles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and to have authority to drive out demons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>so that, "`they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The farmer sows the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, `Who touched me?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-196'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-197'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-198'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-201'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Isn't this the carpenter?

And they took offense at him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-207'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-208'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-209'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirits.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-211'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-212'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-216'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-219'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-220'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-221'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-222'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-223'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ; yet he liked to listen to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-224'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But he answered, "You give them something to eat."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with `unclean' hands?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "`These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> your own traditions!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother,' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and, `Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-5" id="niv-verse-7-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him `unclean'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him `unclean.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-9" id="niv-verse-7-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-296'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-566'>Chapter 14</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>It could have been sold for more than a year's wages </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Say to the owner of the house he enters, `The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"This is my blood of the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-2" id="niv-verse-14-2">b</a>]</sup><span> covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">d</a>]</sup><span> you yourself will disown me three times."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-600'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-601'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>"Abba, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-5" id="niv-verse-14-5">e</a>]</sup><span> Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-610'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-611'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Then everyone deserted him and fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-618'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>"We heard him say, `I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">f</a>]</sup><span> the Son of the Blessed One?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">h</a>]</sup><span> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-9" id="niv-verse-14-9">i</a>]</sup><span> you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-642'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Crucify him!" they shouted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</span></div>
