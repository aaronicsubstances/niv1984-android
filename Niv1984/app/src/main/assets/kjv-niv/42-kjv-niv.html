<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.

<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'><b>(NIV)</b> Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'><b>(NIV)</b> When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
