<h3>Luke 1</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</i>

<h3>Luke 23</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-23-1'><i>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-23-2'><i>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-23-3'><i>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-23-4'><i>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-23-5'><i>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-23-6'><i>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-23-7'><i>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-23-8'><i>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-23-9'><i>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-23-10'><i>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-23-11'><i>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-23-12'><i>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-23-13'><i>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-23-14'><i>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-23-15'><i>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-23-16'><i>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-23-17'><i>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-23-18'><i>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-23-19'><i>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-23-20'><i>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-23-21'><i>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-23-22'><i>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-23-23'><i>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-23-24'><i>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-23-25'><i>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-23-26'><i>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='27'><li id='kverse-23-27'><i>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='28'><li id='kverse-23-28'><i>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='29'><li id='kverse-23-29'><i>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='30'><li id='kverse-23-30'><i>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='31'><li id='kverse-23-31'><i>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='32'><li id='kverse-23-32'><i>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='33'><li id='kverse-23-33'><i>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='34'><li id='kverse-23-34'><i>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='35'><li id='kverse-23-35'><i>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='36'><li id='kverse-23-36'><i>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='37'><li id='kverse-23-37'><i>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='38'><li id='kverse-23-38'><i>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='39'><li id='kverse-23-39'><i>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='40'><li id='kverse-23-40'><i>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='41'><li id='kverse-23-41'><i>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='42'><li id='kverse-23-42'><i>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='43'><li id='kverse-23-43'><i>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='49'><li id='kverse-23-49'><i>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='50'><li id='kverse-23-50'><i>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:</i>
