<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>For nothing is impossible with God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[47] <span>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[48] <span>for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[49] <span>for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[50] <span>His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[51] <span>He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[52] <span>He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[53] <span>He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[54] <span>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[55] <span>to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[56] <span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[57] <span>When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[58] <span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[59] <span>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[60] <span>but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[61] <span>They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[62] <span>Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[63] <span>He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[64] <span>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[65] <span>The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[66] <span>Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[67] <span>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[68] <span>"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[69] <span>He has raised up a horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[70] <span>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[71] <span>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[72] <span>to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[73] <span>the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[74] <span>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[75] <span>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[76] <span>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[77] <span>to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[78] <span>because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[79] <span>to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[80] <span>And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife </span><i>was</i><span> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name </span><i>was</i><span> Elisabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were </span><i>now</i><span> well stricken in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>And when Zacharias saw </span><i>him</i><span>, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on </span><i>me</i><span>, to take away my reproach among men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name </span><i>was</i><span> Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, </span><i>thou that art</i><span> highly favoured, the Lord </span><i>is</i><span> with thee: blessed </span><i>art</i><span> thou among women.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>And when she saw </span><i>him</i><span>, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed </span><i>art</i><span> thou among women, and blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the fruit of thy womb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>And whence </span><i>is</i><span> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>And blessed </span><i>is</i><span> she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[47] <span>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[48] <span>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[49] <span>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy </span><i>is</i><span> his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[50] <span>And his mercy </span><i>is</i><span> on them that fear him from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[51] <span>He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[52] <span>He hath put down the mighty from </span><i>their</i><span> seats, and exalted them of low degree.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[53] <span>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[54] <span>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of </span><i>his</i><span> mercy;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[55] <span>As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[56] <span>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[57] <span>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[58] <span>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[59] <span>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[60] <span>And his mother answered and said, Not </span><i>so</i><span>; but he shall be called John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[61] <span>And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[62] <span>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[63] <span>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-83'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[1] <span>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[2] <span>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[3] <span>And everyone went to his own town to register.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[4] <span>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[5] <span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[6] <span>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[7] <span>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[8] <span>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[9] <span>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[10] <span>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[11] <span>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[12] <span>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[13] <span>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[14] <span>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[15] <span>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[16] <span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[17] <span>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[18] <span>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[19] <span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[20] <span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[21] <span>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[22] <span>When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[23] <span>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[24] <span>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'>[25] <span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'>[26] <span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'>[27] <span>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[28] <span>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[29] <span>"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> your servant in peace.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'>[33] <span>The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'>[34] <span>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'>[35] <span>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'>[36] <span>There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120'>[37] <span>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'>[38] <span>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'>[39] <span>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'>[40] <span>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'>[41] <span>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'>[42] <span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'>[43] <span>After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[44] <span>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'>[45] <span>When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[46] <span>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[47] <span>Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[48] <span>When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[49] <span>"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[51] <span>Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'>[4] <span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'>[2] <span>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'>[33] <span>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-7" id="niv-verse-4-7">g</a>]</sup><span> spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'>[40] <span>When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-178'>[1] <span>And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-179'>[2] <span>Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-180'>[3] <span>And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-181'>[4] <span>And Jesus answered him, saying, </span><span class="wj">It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-182'>[5] <span>And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-183'>[6] <span>And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-184'>[7] <span>If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-185'>[8] <span>And Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-186'>[9] <span>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-187'>[10] <span>For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-188'>[11] <span>And in </span><i>their</i><span> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-189'>[12] <span>And Jesus answering said unto him, </span><span class="wj">It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-190'>[13] <span>And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-191'>[14] <span>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-192'>[15] <span>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-193'>[16] <span>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-194'>[17] <span>And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-195'>[18] <span class="wj">The Spirit of the Lord </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-196'>[19] <span class="wj">To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-197'>[20] <span>And he closed the book, and he gave </span><i>it</i><span> again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-198'>[21] <span>And he began to say unto them, </span><span class="wj">This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-199'>[22] <span>And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-200'>[23] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-201'>[24] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-202'>[25] <span class="wj">But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-203'>[26] <span class="wj">But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, </span><i class="wj">a city</i><span class="wj"> of Sidon, unto a woman </span><i class="wj">that was</i><span class="wj"> a widow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-204'>[27] <span class="wj">And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-205'>[28] <span>And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-206'>[29] <span>And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-207'>[30] <span>But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-208'>[31] <span>And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-209'>[32] <span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-210'>[33] <span>And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-211'>[34] <span>Saying, Let </span><i>us</i><span> alone; what have we to do with thee, </span><i>thou</i><span> Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-212'>[35] <span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, </span><span class="wj">Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span><span> And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-213'>[36] <span>And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word </span><i>is</i><span> this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-214'>[37] <span>And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-215'>[38] <span>And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-216'>[39] <span>And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-217'>[40] <span>Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-218'>[41] <span>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking </span><i>them</i><span> suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-219'>[42] <span>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-220'>[43] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-221'>[44] <span>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-223'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-224'>[1] <span>One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'>[2] <span>he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'>[3] <span>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'>[4] <span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the nets for a catch."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'>[5] <span>Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'>[6] <span>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'>[7] <span>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'>[8] <span>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'>[9] <span>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'>[10] <span>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'>[11] <span>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'>[12] <span>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'>[13] <span>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'>[14] <span>Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'>[15] <span>Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'>[16] <span>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'>[17] <span>One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'>[18] <span>Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[19] <span>When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[20] <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[21] <span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[22] <span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[23] <span>Which is easier: to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up and walk'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[24] <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[25] <span>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[26] <span>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[27] <span>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[28] <span>and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[29] <span>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[30] <span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'>[31] <span>Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'>[32] <span>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[33] <span>They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[34] <span>Jesus answered, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[35] <span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[36] <span>He told them this parable: "No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[37] <span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[38] <span>No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[39] <span>And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, `The old is better.'"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-225'>[2] <span>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing </span><i>their</i><span> nets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-226'>[3] <span>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-228'>[5] <span>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-231'>[8] <span>When Simon Peter saw </span><i>it</i><span>, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-232'>[9] <span>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-234'>[11] <span>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-235'>[12] <span>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on </span><i>his</i><span> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-236'>[13] <span>And he put forth </span><i>his</i><span> hand, and touched him, saying, </span><span class="wj">I will: be thou clean.</span><span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-239'>[16] <span>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-240'>[17] <span>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was </span><i>present</i><span> to heal them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-241'>[18] <span>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought </span><i>means</i><span> to bring him in, and to lay </span><i>him</i><span> before him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-243'>[20] <span>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-264'>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[1] <span>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[2] <span>Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[3] <span>Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[4] <span>He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[5] <span>Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[6] <span>On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[7] <span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[8] <span>But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'>[9] <span>Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[10] <span>He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'>[11] <span>But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-276'>[12] <span>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'>[13] <span>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'>[14] <span>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'>[15] <span>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'>[16] <span>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'>[17] <span>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'>[18] <span>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirits were cured,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283'>[19] <span>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'>[20] <span>Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'>[21] <span>Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'>[22] <span>Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'>[23] <span>"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'>[24] <span>"But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'>[25] <span>Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'>[26] <span>Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'>[27] <span>"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'>[28] <span>bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293'>[29] <span>If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294'>[30] <span>Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'>[31] <span>Do to others as you would have them do to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-296'>[32] <span>"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even `sinners' love those who love them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-297'>[33] <span>And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even `sinners' do that.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298'>[34] <span>And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even `sinners' lend to `sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-299'>[35] <span>But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'>[36] <span>Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'>[37] <span>"Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[38] <span>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[39] <span>He also told them this parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[40] <span>A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[41] <span>"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[42] <span>How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[43] <span>"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[44] <span>Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[45] <span>The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[46] <span>"Why do you call me, `Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[47] <span>I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'>[48] <span>He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'>[49] <span>But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-266'>[2] <span>And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-268'>[4] <span class="wj">How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-271'>[7] <span>And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-274'>[10] <span>And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, </span><span class="wj">Stretch forth thy hand.</span><span> And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-275'>[11] <span>And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-276'>[12] <span>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-277'>[13] <span>And when it was day, he called </span><i>unto him</i><span> his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-281'>[17] <span>And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-282'>[18] <span>And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-283'>[19] <span>And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed </span><i>them</i><span> all.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-315'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316'>[1] <span>When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317'>[2] <span>There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'>[3] <span>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'>[4] <span>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320'>[5] <span>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321'>[6] <span>So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'>[7] <span>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'>[8] <span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, `Go,' and he goes; and that one, `Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, `Do this,' and he does it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'>[9] <span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'>[10] <span>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'>[11] <span>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327'>[12] <span>As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328'>[13] <span>When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329'>[14] <span>Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'>[15] <span>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331'>[16] <span>They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332'>[17] <span>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and the surrounding country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333'>[18] <span>John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'>[19] <span>he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'>[20] <span>When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, `Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'>[21] <span>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'>[22] <span>So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'>[23] <span>Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'>[24] <span>After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'>[25] <span>If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'>[26] <span>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'>[27] <span>This is the one about whom it is written: "`I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'>[28] <span>I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'>[29] <span>(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'>[30] <span>But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'>[31] <span>"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'>[32] <span>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: "`We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'>[33] <span>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, `He has a demon.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'>[34] <span>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, `Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners."'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'>[35] <span>But wisdom is proved right by all her children."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-351'>[36] <span>Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352'>[37] <span>When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'>[38] <span>and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'>[39] <span>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'>[40] <span>Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'>[41] <span>"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and the other fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'>[42] <span>Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'>[43] <span>Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'>[44] <span>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'>[45] <span>You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'>[46] <span>You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'>[47] <span>Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'>[48] <span>Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'>[49] <span>The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'>[50] <span>Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-315'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-316'>[1] <span>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-317'>[2] <span>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-318'>[3] <span>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-319'>[4] <span>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-320'>[5] <span>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-321'>[6] <span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-322'>[7] <span>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-323'>[8] <span>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-324'>[9] <span>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, </span><span class="wj">I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-325'>[10] <span>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-326'>[11] <span>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-327'>[12] <span>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-328'>[13] <span>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Weep not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-329'>[14] <span>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare </span><i>him</i><span> stood still. And he said, </span><span class="wj">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-330'>[15] <span>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-331'>[16] <span>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-332'>[17] <span>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-333'>[18] <span>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-334'>[19] <span>And John calling </span><i>unto him</i><span> two of his disciples sent </span><i>them</i><span> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-335'>[20] <span>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-336'>[21] <span>And in that same hour he cured many of </span><i>their</i><span> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many </span><i>that were</i><span> blind he gave sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'>[22] <span>Then Jesus answering said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-338'>[23] <span class="wj">And blessed is </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-339'>[24] <span>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, </span><span class="wj">What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-340'>[25] <span class="wj">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-341'>[26] <span class="wj">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-342'>[27] <span class="wj">This is </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-343'>[28] <span class="wj">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-344'>[29] <span>And all the people that heard </span><i>him</i><span>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-345'>[30] <span>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-346'>[31] <span>And the Lord said, </span><span class="wj">Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-347'>[32] <span class="wj">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-348'>[33] <span class="wj">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-351'>[36] <span>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-352'>[37] <span>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that </span><i>Jesus</i><span> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-354'>[39] <span>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw </span><i>it</i><span>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman </span><i>this is</i><span> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-355'>[40] <span>And Jesus answering said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.</span><span> And he saith, Master, say on.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-356'>[41] <span class="wj">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-357'>[42] <span class="wj">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-367'>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'>[1] <span>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'>[2] <span>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'>[3] <span>Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'>[4] <span>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'>[5] <span>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'>[6] <span>Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'>[7] <span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'>[8] <span>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-376'>[9] <span>His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-377'>[10] <span>He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378'>[11] <span>"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'>[12] <span>Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'>[13] <span>Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'>[14] <span>The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'>[15] <span>But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-383'>[16] <span>"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'>[17] <span>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'>[18] <span>Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'>[19] <span>Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-387'>[20] <span>Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-388'>[21] <span>He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-389'>[22] <span>One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-390'>[23] <span>As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-391'>[24] <span>The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'>[25] <span>"Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'>[26] <span>They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> which is across the lake from Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'>[27] <span>When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'>[28] <span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'>[29] <span>For Jesus had commanded the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'>[30] <span>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'>[31] <span>And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'>[32] <span>A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'>[33] <span>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'>[34] <span>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-402'>[35] <span>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-403'>[36] <span>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-404'>[37] <span>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'>[38] <span>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-406'>[39] <span>"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-407'>[40] <span>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-408'>[41] <span>Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-409'>[42] <span>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'>[43] <span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-4" id="niv-verse-8-4">d</a>]</sup><span> but no one could heal her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'>[44] <span>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-412'>[45] <span>"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-413'>[46] <span>But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'>[47] <span>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'>[48] <span>Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'>[49] <span>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'>[50] <span>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'>[51] <span>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'>[52] <span>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'>[53] <span>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'>[54] <span>But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'>[55] <span>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'>[56] <span>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-368'>[1] <span>And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve </span><i>were</i><span> with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-369'>[2] <span>And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-370'>[3] <span>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-371'>[4] <span>And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-372'>[5] <span class="wj">A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-373'>[6] <span class="wj">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-374'>[7] <span class="wj">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-375'>[8] <span class="wj">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.</span><span> And when he had said these things, he cried, </span><span class="wj">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-376'>[9] <span>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-377'>[10] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-378'>[11] <span class="wj">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-379'>[12] <span class="wj">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-380'>[13] <span class="wj">They on the rock </span><i class="wj">are they</i><span class="wj">, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-381'>[14] <span class="wj">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of </span><i class="wj">this</i><span class="wj"> life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-382'>[15] <span class="wj">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, and bring forth fruit with patience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-383'>[16] <span class="wj">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> under a bed; but setteth </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-384'>[17] <span class="wj">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither </span><i class="wj">any thing</i><span class="wj"> hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-385'>[18] <span class="wj">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-386'>[19] <span>Then came to him </span><i>his</i><span> mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-387'>[20] <span>And it was told him </span><i>by certain</i><span> which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-388'>[21] <span>And he answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-389'>[22] <span>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Let us go over unto the other side of the lake.</span><span> And they launched forth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-390'>[23] <span>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled </span><i>with water</i><span>, and were in jeopardy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-391'>[24] <span>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-392'>[25] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Where is your faith?</span><span> And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-393'>[26] <span>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-394'>[27] <span>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in </span><i>any</i><span> house, but in the tombs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-395'>[28] <span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, </span><i>thou</i><span> Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-396'>[29] <span>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-397'>[30] <span>And Jesus asked him, saying, </span><span class="wj">What is thy name?</span><span> And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-398'>[31] <span>And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-399'>[32] <span>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-400'>[33] <span>Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-401'>[34] <span>When they that fed </span><i>them</i><span> saw what was done, they fled, and went and told </span><i>it</i><span> in the city and in the country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-402'>[35] <span>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-403'>[36] <span>They also which saw </span><i>it</i><span> told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-404'>[37] <span>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-405'>[38] <span>Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-406'>[39] <span class="wj">Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee.</span><span> And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-407'>[40] <span>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people </span><i>gladly</i><span> received him: for they were all waiting for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-408'>[41] <span>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-409'>[42] <span>For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-410'>[43] <span>And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-411'>[44] <span>Came behind </span><i>him</i><span>, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-412'>[45] <span>And Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Who touched me?</span><span> When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press </span><i>thee</i><span>, and sayest thou, </span><span class="wj">Who touched me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-413'>[46] <span>And Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-414'>[47] <span>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-415'>[48] <span>And he said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-416'>[49] <span>While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's </span><i>house</i><span>, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-417'>[50] <span>But when Jesus heard </span><i>it</i><span>, he answered him, saying, </span><span class="wj">Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-418'>[51] <span>And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-419'>[52] <span>And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, </span><span class="wj">Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-420'>[53] <span>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-421'>[54] <span>And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, </span><span class="wj">Maid, arise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-422'>[55] <span>And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-423'>[56] <span>And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-425'>Chapter 9</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'>[1] <span>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'>[2] <span>and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'>[3] <span>He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-429'>[4] <span>Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-430'>[5] <span>If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'>[6] <span>So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'>[7] <span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'>[8] <span>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'>[9] <span>But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'>[10] <span>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'>[11] <span>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'>[12] <span>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'>[13] <span>He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'>[14] <span>(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440'>[15] <span>The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441'>[16] <span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442'>[17] <span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'>[18] <span>Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[19] <span>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[20] <span>"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'>[21] <span>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[22] <span>And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[23] <span>Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[24] <span>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[25] <span>What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[26] <span>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[27] <span>I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[28] <span>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[29] <span>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-455'>[30] <span>Two men, Moses and Elijah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-456'>[31] <span>appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-457'>[32] <span>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-458'>[33] <span>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-459'>[34] <span>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-460'>[35] <span>A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-461'>[36] <span>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-462'>[37] <span>The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-463'>[38] <span>A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-464'>[39] <span>A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-465'>[40] <span>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-466'>[41] <span>"O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-467'>[42] <span>Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">b</a>]</sup><span> spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-468'>[43] <span>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-469'>[44] <span>"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-470'>[45] <span>But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-471'>[46] <span>An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-472'>[47] <span>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-473'>[48] <span>Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-474'>[49] <span>"Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'>[50] <span>"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-476'>[51] <span>As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-477'>[52] <span>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-478'>[53] <span>but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-479'>[54] <span>When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-3" id="niv-verse-9-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-480'>[55] <span>But Jesus turned and rebuked them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[56] <span>and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-4" id="niv-verse-9-4">d</a>]</sup><span> they went to another village.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-482'>[57] <span>As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-483'>[58] <span>Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-484'>[59] <span>He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-485'>[60] <span>Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-486'>[61] <span>Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-487'>[62] <span>Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-426'>[1] <span>Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-427'>[2] <span>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-428'>[3] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Take nothing for </span><i class="wj">your</i><span class="wj"> journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-429'>[4] <span class="wj">And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-430'>[5] <span class="wj">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-431'>[6] <span>And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-432'>[7] <span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-433'>[8] <span>And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-434'>[9] <span>And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-435'>[10] <span>And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-436'>[11] <span>And the people, when they knew </span><i>it</i><span>, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-437'>[12] <span>And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-438'>[13] <span>But he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Give ye them to eat.</span><span> And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-439'>[14] <span>For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, </span><span class="wj">Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-440'>[15] <span>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-441'>[16] <span>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-442'>[17] <span>And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-443'>[18] <span>And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Whom say the people that I am?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-444'>[19] <span>They answering said, John the Baptist; but some </span><i>say</i><span>, Elias; and others </span><i>say</i><span>, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-445'>[20] <span>He said unto them, </span><span class="wj">But whom say ye that I am?</span><span> Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-446'>[21] <span>And he straitly charged them, and commanded </span><i>them</i><span> to tell no man that thing;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-447'>[22] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-448'>[23] <span>And he said to </span><i>them</i><span> all, </span><span class="wj">If any </span><i class="wj">man</i><span class="wj"> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-449'>[24] <span class="wj">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-450'>[25] <span class="wj">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-451'>[26] <span class="wj">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and </span><i class="wj">in his</i><span class="wj"> Father's, and of the holy angels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-452'>[27] <span class="wj">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-453'>[28] <span>And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-454'>[29] <span>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment </span><i>was</i><span> white </span><i>and</i><span> glistering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-455'>[30] <span>And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-456'>[31] <span>Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-457'>[32] <span>But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-458'>[33] <span>And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-459'>[34] <span>While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-460'>[35] <span>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-461'>[36] <span>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept </span><i>it</i><span> close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-462'>[37] <span>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-463'>[38] <span>And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-464'>[39] <span>And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-465'>[40] <span>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-466'>[41] <span>And Jesus answering said, </span><span class="wj">O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-467'>[42] <span>And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare </span><i>him</i><span>. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-468'>[43] <span>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-469'>[44] <span class="wj">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-470'>[45] <span>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-471'>[46] <span>Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-472'>[47] <span>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-473'>[48] <span>And said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-474'>[49] <span>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-475'>[50] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Forbid </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> not: for he that is not against us is for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-476'>[51] <span>And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-477'>[52] <span>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-478'>[53] <span>And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-479'>[54] <span>And when his disciples James and John saw </span><i>this</i><span>, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-480'>[55] <span>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, </span><span class="wj">Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-481'>[56] <span class="wj">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj">.</span><span> And they went to another village.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-482'>[57] <span>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain </span><i>man</i><span> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-483'>[58] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Foxes have holes, and birds of the air </span><i class="wj">have</i><span class="wj"> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> head.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-484'>[59] <span>And he said unto another, </span><span class="wj">Follow me.</span><span> But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-485'>[60] <span>Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-486'>[61] <span>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-487'>[62] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[1] <span>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup><span> others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-491'>[2] <span>He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-492'>[3] <span>Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'>[12] <span>I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'>[13] <span>"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'>[14] <span>But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'>[15] <span>And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'>[16] <span>"He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'>[17] <span>The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[18] <span>He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'>[19] <span>I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[20] <span>However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[21] <span>At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'>[22] <span>"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'>[23] <span>Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'>[24] <span>For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'>[25] <span>On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'>[26] <span>"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'>[27] <span>He answered: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-3" id="niv-verse-10-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ; and, `Love your neighbor as yourself.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-4" id="niv-verse-10-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'>[28] <span>"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'>[29] <span>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'>[30] <span>In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'>[31] <span>A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'>[32] <span>So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'>[33] <span>But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'>[34] <span>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'>[35] <span>The next day he took out two silver coins </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and gave them to the innkeeper. `Look after him,' he said, `and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'>[36] <span>"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'>[37] <span>The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'>[38] <span>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'>[39] <span>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'>[40] <span>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-530'>[41] <span>"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-531'>[42] <span>but only one thing is needed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-6" id="niv-verse-10-6">f</a>]</sup><span> Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[1] <span>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[2] <span>He said to them, "When you pray, say: "`Father, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'>[5] <span>Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, `Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[6] <span>because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[7] <span>"Then the one inside answers, `Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'>[8] <span>I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-5" id="niv-verse-11-5">e</a>]</sup><span> he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'>[9] <span>"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'>[10] <span>For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'>[11] <span>"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-6" id="niv-verse-11-6">f</a>]</sup><span> a fish, will give him a snake instead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'>[12] <span>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[13] <span>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[14] <span>Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[15] <span>But some of them said, "By Beelzebub, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-7" id="niv-verse-11-7">g</a>]</sup><span> the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[16] <span>Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[17] <span>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[18] <span>If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[19] <span>Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[20] <span>But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'>[21] <span>"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'>[22] <span>But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'>[23] <span>"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'>[24] <span>"When an evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-8" id="niv-verse-11-8">h</a>]</sup><span> spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, `I will return to the house I left.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-558'>[25] <span>When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-559'>[26] <span>Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'>[27] <span>As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'>[28] <span>He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'>[29] <span>As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'>[30] <span>For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'>[31] <span>The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-9" id="niv-verse-11-9">i</a>]</sup><span> greater than Solomon is here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'>[32] <span>The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'>[33] <span>"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'>[34] <span>Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'>[35] <span>See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'>[36] <span>Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'>[37] <span>When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'>[38] <span>But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'>[39] <span>Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'>[40] <span>You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'>[41] <span>But give what is inside [the dish] </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-10" id="niv-verse-11-10">j</a>]</sup><span> to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'>[42] <span>"Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'>[43] <span>"Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'>[44] <span>"Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'>[45] <span>One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'>[46] <span>Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'>[47] <span>"Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'>[48] <span>So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'>[49] <span>Because of this, God in his wisdom said, `I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'>[50] <span>Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'>[51] <span>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'>[52] <span>"Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'>[53] <span>When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-651'>[1] <span>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-652'>[2] <span>Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-653'>[3] <span>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-654'>[4] <span>Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-655'>[5] <span>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-656'>[6] <span>Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-657'>[7] <span>So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, `For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-658'>[8] <span>"`Sir,' the man replied, `leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-659'>[9] <span>If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-660'>[10] <span>On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-661'>[11] <span>and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-662'>[12] <span>When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-663'>[13] <span>Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-664'>[14] <span>Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-665'>[15] <span>The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-666'>[16] <span>Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-667'>[17] <span>When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-668'>[18] <span>Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-669'>[19] <span>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-670'>[20] <span>Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-671'>[21] <span>It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of flour until it worked all through the dough."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-672'>[22] <span>Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-673'>[23] <span>Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-674'>[24] <span>"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-675'>[25] <span>Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, `Sir, open the door for us.' "But he will answer, `I don't know you or where you come from.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-676'>[26] <span>"Then you will say, `We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-677'>[27] <span>"But he will reply, `I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-678'>[28] <span>"There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-679'>[29] <span>People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-680'>[30] <span>Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-681'>[31] <span>At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-682'>[32] <span>He replied, "Go tell that fox, `I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-683'>[33] <span>In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-684'>[34] <span>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-685'>[35] <span>Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, `Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-688'>[1] <span>One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-689'>[2] <span>There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-690'>[3] <span>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-691'>[4] <span>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-692'>[5] <span>Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'>[6] <span>And they had nothing to say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'>[7] <span>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'>[8] <span>"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'>[9] <span>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, `Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'>[10] <span>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, `Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-698'>[11] <span>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'>[12] <span>Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700'>[13] <span>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701'>[14] <span>and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-702'>[15] <span>When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703'>[16] <span>Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-704'>[17] <span>At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, `Come, for everything is now ready.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-705'>[18] <span>"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, `I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-706'>[19] <span>"Another said, `I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-712'>[25] <span>Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-714'>[27] <span>And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-715'>[28] <span>"Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-716'>[29] <span>For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-688'>[1] <span>And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-689'>[2] <span>And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-690'>[3] <span>And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, </span><span class="wj">Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-691'>[4] <span>And they held their peace. And he took </span><i>him</i><span>, and healed him, and let him go;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-692'>[5] <span>And answered them, saying, </span><span class="wj">Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-694'>[7] <span>And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-698'>[11] <span class="wj">For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-699'>[12] <span>Then said he also to him that bade him, </span><span class="wj">When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor </span><i class="wj">thy</i><span class="wj"> rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-700'>[13] <span class="wj">But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-703'>[16] <span>Then said he unto him, </span><span class="wj">A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-706'>[19] <span class="wj">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-708'>[21] <span class="wj">So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-735'>[11] <span>Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-738'>[14] <span>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-739'>[15] <span>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-740'>[16] <span>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-763'>[5] <span>"So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, `How much do you owe my master?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-764'>[6] <span>"`Eight hundred gallons</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-16-1" id="niv-verse-16-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of olive oil,' he replied. "The manager told him, `Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-766'>[8] <span>"The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-759'>[1] <span>And he said also unto his disciples, </span><span class="wj">There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-760'>[2] <span class="wj">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-761'>[3] <span class="wj">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-762'>[4] <span class="wj">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-763'>[5] <span class="wj">So he called every one of his lord's debtors </span><i class="wj">unto him</i><span class="wj">, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-765'>[7] <span class="wj">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-766'>[8] <span class="wj">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-767'>[9] <span class="wj">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-771'>[13] <span class="wj">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-779'>[21] <span class="wj">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-780'>[22] <span class="wj">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-781'>[23] <span class="wj">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-783'>[25] <span class="wj">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-784'>[26] <span class="wj">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that </span><i class="wj">would come</i><span class="wj"> from thence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-785'>[27] <span class="wj">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-786'>[28] <span class="wj">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-787'>[29] <span class="wj">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-788'>[30] <span class="wj">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-792'>[1] <span>Jesus said to his disciples: "Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-793'>[2] <span>It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-794'>[3] <span>So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-795'>[4] <span>If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, `I repent,' forgive him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-796'>[5] <span>The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797'>[6] <span>He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, `Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-798'>[7] <span>"Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, `Come along now and sit down to eat'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799'>[8] <span>Would he not rather say, `Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800'>[9] <span>Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'>[10] <span>So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, `We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'>[11] <span>Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'>[12] <span>As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-1" id="niv-verse-17-1">a</a>]</sup><span> met him. They stood at a distance</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'>[13] <span>and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805'>[14] <span>When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'>[15] <span>One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'>[16] <span>He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'>[17] <span>Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'>[18] <span>Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810'>[19] <span>Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-811'>[20] <span>Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812'>[21] <span>nor will people say, `Here it is,' or `There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-2" id="niv-verse-17-2">b</a>]</sup><span> you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813'>[22] <span>Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814'>[23] <span>Men will tell you, `There he is!' or `Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'>[24] <span>For the Son of Man in his day </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-3" id="niv-verse-17-3">c</a>]</sup><span> will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'>[30] <span>"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'>[31] <span>On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-830'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'>[1] <span>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'>[2] <span>He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'>[3] <span>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, `Grant me justice against my adversary.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'>[4] <span>"For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, `Even though I don't fear God or care about men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'>[5] <span>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'>[6] <span>And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'>[7] <span>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'>[8] <span>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'>[9] <span>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[10] <span>"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'>[11] <span>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'>[12] <span>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'>[13] <span>"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'>[14] <span>"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'>[15] <span>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'>[16] <span>But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'>[17] <span>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'>[18] <span>A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'>[19] <span>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'>[20] <span>You know the commandments: `Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'>[21] <span>"All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'>[22] <span>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'>[23] <span>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'>[24] <span>Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-855'>[25] <span>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-856'>[26] <span>Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857'>[27] <span>Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858'>[28] <span>Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-859'>[29] <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-860'>[30] <span>will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-861'>[31] <span>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-862'>[32] <span>He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863'>[33] <span>On the third day he will rise again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864'>[34] <span>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-865'>[35] <span>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866'>[36] <span>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867'>[37] <span>They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-868'>[38] <span>He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-869'>[39] <span>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-870'>[40] <span>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-871'>[41] <span>"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-872'>[42] <span>Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-873'>[43] <span>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-830'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-831'>[1] <span>And he spake a parable unto them </span><i>to this end</i><span>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-832'>[2] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-833'>[3] <span class="wj">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-834'>[4] <span class="wj">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-835'>[5] <span class="wj">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-836'>[6] <span>And the Lord said, </span><span class="wj">Hear what the unjust judge saith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-837'>[7] <span class="wj">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-838'>[8] <span class="wj">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-839'>[9] <span>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-840'>[10] <span class="wj">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-841'>[11] <span class="wj">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj">, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-842'>[12] <span class="wj">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-843'>[13] <span class="wj">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as </span><i class="wj">his</i><span class="wj"> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-844'>[14] <span class="wj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified </span><i class="wj">rather</i><span class="wj"> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-845'>[15] <span>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when </span><i>his</i><span> disciples saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they rebuked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-846'>[16] <span>But Jesus called them </span><i>unto him</i><span>, and said, </span><span class="wj">Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-847'>[17] <span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-848'>[18] <span>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-849'>[19] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Why callest thou me good? none </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> good, save one, </span><i class="wj">that is</i><span class="wj">, God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'>[20] <span class="wj">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-852'>[22] <span>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-853'>[23] <span>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-854'>[24] <span>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, </span><span class="wj">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-855'>[25] <span class="wj">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-856'>[26] <span>And they that heard </span><i>it</i><span> said, Who then can be saved?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-857'>[27] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-858'>[28] <span>Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-859'>[29] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-860'>[30] <span class="wj">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-861'>[31] <span>Then he took </span><i>unto him</i><span> the twelve, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-862'>[32] <span class="wj">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-864'>[34] <span>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-865'>[35] <span>And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-866'>[36] <span>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-867'>[37] <span>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-868'>[38] <span>And he cried, saying, Jesus, </span><i>thou</i><span> Son of David, have mercy on me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-869'>[39] <span>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, </span><i>Thou</i><span> Son of David, have mercy on me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-870'>[40] <span>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-871'>[41] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</span><span> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-873'>[43] <span>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw </span><i>it</i><span>, gave praise unto God.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-875'>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-876'>[1] <span>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-877'>[2] <span>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-878'>[3] <span>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-879'>[4] <span>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-880'>[5] <span>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-881'>[6] <span>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-882'>[7] <span>All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a `sinner.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883'>[8] <span>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-884'>[9] <span>Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-885'>[10] <span>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-886'>[11] <span>While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-887'>[12] <span>He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888'>[13] <span>So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> `Put this money to work,' he said, `until I come back.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-889'>[14] <span>"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, `We don't want this man to be our king.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-890'>[15] <span>"He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-891'>[16] <span>"The first one came and said, `Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-892'>[17] <span>"`Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. `Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-893'>[18] <span>"The second came and said, `Sir, your mina has earned five more.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-894'>[19] <span>"His master answered, `You take charge of five cities.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-895'>[20] <span>"Then another servant came and said, `Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-896'>[21] <span>I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-897'>[22] <span>"His master replied, `I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-898'>[23] <span>Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-899'>[24] <span>"Then he said to those standing by, `Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-900'>[25] <span>"`Sir,' they said, `he already has ten!'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-903'>[28] <span>After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-904'>[29] <span>As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-905'>[30] <span>"Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-907'>[32] <span>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-908'>[33] <span>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909'>[34] <span>They replied, "The Lord needs it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-910'>[35] <span>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-911'>[36] <span>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912'>[37] <span>When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-913'>[38] <span>"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-914'>[39] <span>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-915'>[40] <span>"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-916'>[41] <span>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-917'>[42] <span>and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-918'>[43] <span>The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919'>[44] <span>They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'>[45] <span>Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-921'>[46] <span>"It is written," he said to them, "`My house will be a house of prayer' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup><span> ; but you have made it `a den of robbers.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-4" id="niv-verse-19-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-922'>[47] <span>Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-923'>[48] <span>Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-876'>[1] <span>And </span><i>Jesus</i><span> entered and passed through Jericho.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-877'>[2] <span>And, behold, </span><i>there was</i><span> a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-878'>[3] <span>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-879'>[4] <span>And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that </span><i>way</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-880'>[5] <span>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-881'>[6] <span>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-882'>[7] <span>And when they saw </span><i>it</i><span>, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-883'>[8] <span>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore </span><i>him</i><span> fourfold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-884'>[9] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-885'>[10] <span class="wj">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-886'>[11] <span>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-887'>[12] <span>He said therefore, </span><span class="wj">A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-888'>[13] <span class="wj">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-889'>[14] <span class="wj">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this </span><i class="wj">man</i><span class="wj"> to reign over us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-890'>[15] <span class="wj">And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-891'>[16] <span class="wj">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-892'>[17] <span class="wj">And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-893'>[18] <span class="wj">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-894'>[19] <span class="wj">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-895'>[20] <span class="wj">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, </span><i class="wj">here is</i><span class="wj"> thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-896'>[21] <span class="wj">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-897'>[22] <span class="wj">And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, </span><i class="wj">thou</i><span class="wj"> wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-898'>[23] <span class="wj">Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-899'>[24] <span class="wj">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj"> to him that hath ten pounds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-900'>[25] <span class="wj">(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-901'>[26] <span class="wj">For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-902'>[27] <span class="wj">But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-903'>[28] <span>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-904'>[29] <span>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called </span><i>the mount</i><span> of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-905'>[30] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">Go ye into the village over against </span><i class="wj">you</i><span class="wj">; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring </span><i class="wj">him hither</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-906'>[31] <span class="wj">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj">? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-907'>[32] <span>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-908'>[33] <span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-909'>[34] <span>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-910'>[35] <span>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-911'>[36] <span>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-912'>[37] <span>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-913'>[38] <span>Saying, Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-914'>[39] <span>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-915'>[40] <span>And he answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-916'>[41] <span>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-917'>[42] <span>Saying, </span><span class="wj">If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things </span><i class="wj">which belong</i><span class="wj"> unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-918'>[43] <span class="wj">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-919'>[44] <span class="wj">And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-920'>[45] <span>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-921'>[46] <span>Saying unto them, </span><span class="wj">It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-922'>[47] <span>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-923'>[48] <span>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-925'>Chapter 20</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-926'>[1] <span>One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-927'>[2] <span>"Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-928'>[3] <span>He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-929'>[4] <span>John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-930'>[5] <span>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will ask, `Why didn't you believe him?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-931'>[6] <span>But if we say, `From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-932'>[7] <span>So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-933'>[8] <span>Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-934'>[9] <span>He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-935'>[10] <span>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-936'>[11] <span>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-937'>[12] <span>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-938'>[13] <span>"Then the owner of the vineyard said, `What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-939'>[14] <span>"But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. `This is the heir,' they said. `Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-940'>[15] <span>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-941'>[16] <span>He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-942'>[17] <span>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-2" id="niv-verse-20-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-943'>[18] <span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-944'>[19] <span>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-945'>[20] <span>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-946'>[21] <span>So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-947'>[22] <span>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-948'>[23] <span>He saw through their duplicity and said to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-949'>[24] <span>"Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-950'>[25] <span>"Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-951'>[26] <span>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-952'>[27] <span>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-953'>[28] <span>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-954'>[29] <span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-955'>[30] <span>The second</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-956'>[31] <span>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-957'>[32] <span>Finally, the woman died too.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-958'>[33] <span>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-959'>[34] <span>Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-960'>[35] <span>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-961'>[36] <span>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-962'>[37] <span>But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord `the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-3" id="niv-verse-20-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-963'>[38] <span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-964'>[39] <span>Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-965'>[40] <span>And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-966'>[41] <span>Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-4" id="niv-verse-20-4">d</a>]</sup><span> is the Son of David?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-967'>[42] <span>David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-968'>[43] <span>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-5" id="niv-verse-20-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-969'>[44] <span>David calls him `Lord.' How then can he be his son?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-970'>[45] <span>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-971'>[46] <span>"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-972'>[47] <span>They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-954'>[29] <span>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-955'>[30] <span>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-956'>[31] <span>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-957'>[32] <span>Last of all the woman died also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-958'>[33] <span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-959'>[34] <span>And Jesus answering said unto them, </span><span class="wj">The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-960'>[35] <span class="wj">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-961'>[36] <span class="wj">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-962'>[37] <span class="wj">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-963'>[38] <span class="wj">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-964'>[39] <span>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-965'>[40] <span>And after that they durst not ask him any </span><i>question at all</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-966'>[41] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">How say they that Christ is David's son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-967'>[42] <span class="wj">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-969'>[44] <span class="wj">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-970'>[45] <span>Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-971'>[46] <span class="wj">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1015'>[1] <span>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1016'>[2] <span>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1021'>[7] <span>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1022'>[8] <span>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1023'>[9] <span>"Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1024'>[10] <span>He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1025'>[11] <span>and say to the owner of the house, `The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1027'>[13] <span>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1028'>[14] <span>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1029'>[15] <span>And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1031'>[17] <span>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1034'>[20] <span>In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1038'>[24] <span>Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1039'>[25] <span>Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1040'>[26] <span>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1041'>[27] <span>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1047'>[33] <span>But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1048'>[34] <span>Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1049'>[35] <span>Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1050'>[36] <span>He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1051'>[37] <span>It is written: `And he was numbered with the transgressors' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-2" id="niv-verse-22-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1052'>[38] <span>The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That is enough," he replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1053'>[39] <span>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1054'>[40] <span>On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1055'>[41] <span>He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1056'>[42] <span>"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1057'>[43] <span>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1058'>[44] <span>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-3" id="niv-verse-22-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1059'>[45] <span>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1060'>[46] <span>"Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1061'>[47] <span>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1062'>[48] <span>but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1063'>[49] <span>When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1064'>[50] <span>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1065'>[51] <span>But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1066'>[52] <span>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1067'>[53] <span>Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1068'>[54] <span>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1069'>[55] <span>But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1070'>[56] <span>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1071'>[57] <span>But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1072'>[58] <span>A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1073'>[59] <span>About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1074'>[60] <span>Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1075'>[61] <span>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1076'>[62] <span>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1077'>[63] <span>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1078'>[64] <span>They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1079'>[65] <span>And they said many other insulting things to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1080'>[66] <span>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1081'>[67] <span>"If you are the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-4" id="niv-verse-22-4">d</a>]</sup><span> " they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1083'>[69] <span>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1084'>[70] <span>They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1085'>[71] <span>Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1053'>[39] <span>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1054'>[40] <span>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1059'>[45] <span>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1060'>[46] <span>And said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1061'>[47] <span>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1062'>[48] <span>But Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1063'>[49] <span>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1065'>[51] <span>And Jesus answered and said, </span><span class="wj">Suffer ye thus far.</span><span> And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1066'>[52] <span>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, </span><span class="wj">Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1067'>[53] <span class="wj">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1068'>[54] <span>Then took they him, and led </span><i>him</i><span>, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1069'>[55] <span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1072'>[58] <span>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1075'>[61] <span>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1076'>[62] <span>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1077'>[63] <span>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1089'>[2] <span>And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1090'>[3] <span>So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1091'>[4] <span>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1092'>[5] <span>But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">b</a>]</sup><span> by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1093'>[6] <span>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1094'>[7] <span>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1095'>[8] <span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1096'>[9] <span>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1097'>[10] <span>The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1098'>[11] <span>Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1099'>[12] <span>That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1107'>[20] <span>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1108'>[21] <span>But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1109'>[22] <span>For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1110'>[23] <span>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1111'>[24] <span>So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1112'>[25] <span>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1120'>[33] <span>When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1125'>[38] <span>There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1089'>[2] <span>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this </span><i>fellow</i><span> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1090'>[3] <span>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, </span><span class="wj">Thou sayest </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1091'>[4] <span>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and </span><i>to</i><span> the people, I find no fault in this man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1092'>[5] <span>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1093'>[6] <span>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1094'>[7] <span>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1095'>[8] <span>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long </span><i>season</i><span>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1096'>[9] <span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1097'>[10] <span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1098'>[11] <span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked </span><i>him</i><span>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1109'>[22] <span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let </span><i>him</i><span> go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1110'>[23] <span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1111'>[24] <span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1112'>[25] <span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1113'>[26] <span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear </span><i>it</i><span> after Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1114'>[27] <span>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1121'>[34] <span>Then said Jesus, </span><span class="wj">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span><span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1122'>[35] <span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided </span><i>him</i><span>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1123'>[36] <span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1124'>[37] <span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1125'>[38] <span>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1126'>[39] <span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1127'>[40] <span>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1129'>[42] <span>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1130'>[43] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1131'>[44] <span>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1135'>[48] <span>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1136'>[49] <span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1146'>[1] <span>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1147'>[2] <span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1148'>[3] <span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1149'>[4] <span>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1150'>[5] <span>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1151'>[6] <span>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1152'>[7] <span>`The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1153'>[8] <span>Then they remembered his words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1154'>[9] <span>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1155'>[10] <span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1156'>[11] <span>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1157'>[12] <span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1158'>[13] <span>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">a</a>]</sup><span> from Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1159'>[14] <span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1160'>[15] <span>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1161'>[16] <span>but they were kept from recognizing him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1162'>[17] <span>He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1163'>[18] <span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1164'>[19] <span>"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1165'>[20] <span>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1166'>[21] <span>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1167'>[22] <span>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1168'>[23] <span>but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1169'>[24] <span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1170'>[25] <span>He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1171'>[26] <span>Did not the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-2" id="niv-verse-24-2">b</a>]</sup><span> have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1172'>[27] <span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1173'>[28] <span>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1174'>[29] <span>But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1175'>[30] <span>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1176'>[31] <span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1177'>[32] <span>They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1178'>[33] <span>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1179'>[34] <span>and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1180'>[35] <span>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1181'>[36] <span>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1182'>[37] <span>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1183'>[38] <span>He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1184'>[39] <span>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1185'>[40] <span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1186'>[41] <span>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1187'>[42] <span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1188'>[43] <span>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1189'>[44] <span>He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1190'>[45] <span>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1191'>[46] <span>He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1192'>[47] <span>and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1193'>[48] <span>You are witnesses of these things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1146'>[1] <span>Now upon the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain </span><i>others</i><span> with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1147'>[2] <span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1148'>[3] <span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1149'>[4] <span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1150'>[5] <span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down </span><i>their</i><span> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1151'>[6] <span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1152'>[7] <span>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1153'>[8] <span>And they remembered his words,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1154'>[9] <span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1155'>[10] <span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary </span><i>the mother</i><span> of James, and other </span><i>women that were</i><span> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1156'>[11] <span>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1157'>[12] <span>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1158'>[13] <span>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem </span><i>about</i><span> threescore furlongs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1159'>[14] <span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1160'>[15] <span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed </span><i>together</i><span> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1161'>[16] <span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1162'>[17] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">What manner of communications </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1163'>[18] <span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1164'>[19] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">What things?</span><span> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1165'>[20] <span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1166'>[21] <span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1167'>[22] <span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1168'>[23] <span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1169'>[24] <span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found </span><i>it</i><span> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1170'>[25] <span>Then he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1171'>[26] <span class="wj">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1172'>[27] <span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1173'>[28] <span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1174'>[29] <span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1175'>[30] <span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed </span><i>it</i><span>, and brake, and gave to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1176'>[31] <span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1177'>[32] <span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1178'>[33] <span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1179'>[34] <span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1180'>[35] <span>And they told what things </span><i>were done</i><span> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1181'>[36] <span>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Peace </span><i class="wj">be</i><span class="wj"> unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1182'>[37] <span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1183'>[38] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1184'>[39] <span class="wj">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1185'>[40] <span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them </span><i>his</i><span> hands and </span><i>his</i><span> feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1186'>[41] <span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Have ye here any meat?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1187'>[42] <span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1188'>[43] <span>And he took </span><i>it</i><span>, and did eat before them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1189'>[44] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">These </span><i class="wj">are</i><span class="wj"> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and </span><i class="wj">in</i><span class="wj"> the prophets, and </span><i class="wj">in</i><span class="wj"> the psalms, concerning me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1190'>[45] <span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1191'>[46] <span>And said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1192'>[47] <span class="wj">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1193'>[48] <span class="wj">And ye are witnesses of these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1194'>[49] <span class="wj">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1195'>[50] <span>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1196'>[51] <span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1197'>[52] <span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1198'>[53] <span>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span></div>
