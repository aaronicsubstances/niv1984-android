<h3>Luke 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_1">1</a>]</sup> among us,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_2">2</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'>"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-1-26'>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-1-27'>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-1-28'>The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-1-29'>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-1-30'>But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-1-31'>You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-1-32'>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-1-33'>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-1-34'>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-1-35'>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_3">3</a>]</sup> the Son of God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-1-36'>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-1-37'>For nothing is impossible with God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-1-38'>"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-1-39'>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-1-40'>where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-1-41'>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-1-42'>In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-1-43'>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-1-44'>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-1-45'>Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-1-46'>And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-1-47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-1-48'>for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-1-49'>for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-1-50'>His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-1-51'>He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-1-52'>He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-1-53'>He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-1-54'>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-1-55'>to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-1-56'>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='57'><li id='verse-1-57'>When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='58'><li id='verse-1-58'>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='59'><li id='verse-1-59'>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='60'><li id='verse-1-60'>but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='61'><li id='verse-1-61'>They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='62'><li id='verse-1-62'>Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='63'><li id='verse-1-63'>He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='64'><li id='verse-1-64'>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='65'><li id='verse-1-65'>The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='66'><li id='verse-1-66'>Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='67'><li id='verse-1-67'>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='68'><li id='verse-1-68'>"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='69'><li id='verse-1-69'>He has raised up a horn

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='70'><li id='verse-1-70'>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='71'><li id='verse-1-71'>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='72'><li id='verse-1-72'>to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='73'><li id='verse-1-73'>the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='74'><li id='verse-1-74'>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='75'><li id='verse-1-75'>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='76'><li id='verse-1-76'>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='80'><li id='verse-1-80'>And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.

<h3>Luke 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'>And everyone went to his own town to register.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup> the Lord.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-2-18'>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-2-20'>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-2-21'>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-2-22'>When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-2-23'>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord" 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_2">2</a>]</sup> ),
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-2-24'>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_3">3</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-2-25'>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-2-26'>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-2-27'>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-2-28'>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-2-29'>"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_4">4</a>]</sup> your servant in peace.

<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-2-30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-2-33'>The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-2-34'>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-2-35'>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-2-36'>There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-2-37'>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_5">5</a>]</sup> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-2-38'>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-2-39'>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-2-40'>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-2-41'>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-2-42'>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-2-43'>After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-2-44'>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-2-45'>When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-2-46'>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-2-47'>Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-2-48'>When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-2-49'>"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-2-50'>But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-2-51'>Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-2-52'>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-5-2'>he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-5-3'>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-5-5'>Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."

<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-5-22'>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-5-23'>Which is easier: to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up and walk'?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-5-24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."

<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-5-30'>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and `sinners'?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-5-31'>Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.

</li></ol>

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-6-2'>Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-6-3'>Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-6-4'>He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-6-5'>Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-6-6'>On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-6-7'>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-6-8'>But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-6-9'>Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-6-10'>He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-6-11'>But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-6-12'>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-6-13'>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-6-14'>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-6-15'>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-6-16'>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-6-17'>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-6-18'>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-6-19'>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-6-20'>Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-6-21'>Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-6-22'>Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-6-23'>"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.

<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-6-31'>Do to others as you would have them do to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-6-32'>"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even `sinners' love those who love them.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-6-34'>And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even `sinners' lend to `sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-6-35'>But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-6-36'>Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-6-37'>"Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-6-38'>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-6-39'>He also told them this parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?

<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-6-40'>A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-6-41'>"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-6-42'>How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-6-43'>"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.

<h3>Luke 7</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-7-1'>When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-7-2'>There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-7-3'>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-7-4'>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-7-5'>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-7-6'>So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-7-7'>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-7-8'>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, `Go,' and he goes; and that one, `Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, `Do this,' and he does it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-7-9'>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-7-10'>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-7-11'>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-7-12'>As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-7-13'>When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-7-14'>Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-7-15'>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-7-16'>They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-7-17'>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-7-18'>John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-7-19'>he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-7-20'>When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, `Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-7-21'>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-7-22'>So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-7-23'>Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-7-24'>After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-7-25'>If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-7-26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-7-28'>I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-7-29'>(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-7-30'>But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-7-32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: "`We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-7-36'>Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-7-37'>When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-7-38'>and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-7-39'>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-7-40'>Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-7-41'>"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-7-43'>Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-7-44'>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-7-45'>You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.

<h3>Luke 8</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-8-1'>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-8-2'>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-8-3'>Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-8-4'>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-8-5'>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.

<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-8-7'>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-8-8'>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-8-9'>His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-8-10'>He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup>

<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-8-33'>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-8-34'>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-8-35'>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-8-36'>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-8-37'>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-8-38'>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-8-39'>"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-8-40'>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-8-41'>Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-8-42'>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-8-43'>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_4">4</a>]</sup> but no one could heal her.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-8-44'>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-8-45'>"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-8-46'>But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-8-47'>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-8-48'>Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-8-49'>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-8-50'>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-8-51'>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-8-52'>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-8-53'>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-8-54'>But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-8-55'>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-8-56'>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.

<h3>Luke 9</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-9-1'>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-9-2'>and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-9-3'>He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-9-4'>Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-9-5'>If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-9-6'>So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-9-7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-9-8'>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-9-9'>But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-9-10'>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-9-11'>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-9-12'>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-9-13'>He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-9-14'>(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-9-15'>The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-9-16'>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-9-17'>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-9-18'>Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-9-19'>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-9-20'>"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup> of God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-9-21'>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-9-22'>And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-9-23'>Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-9-24'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-9-25'>What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-9-26'>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-9-27'>I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-9-28'>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-9-29'>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-9-30'>Two men, Moses and Elijah,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-9-31'>appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-9-32'>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-9-33'>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-9-34'>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-9-35'>A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-9-36'>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-9-37'>The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-9-38'>A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-9-39'>A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-9-40'>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-9-41'>"O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-9-42'>Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup> spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-9-43'>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-9-44'>"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-9-45'>But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-9-46'>An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-9-47'>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-9-48'>Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-9-49'>"Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-9-50'>"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-9-51'>As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-9-52'>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-9-53'>but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-9-54'>When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup> ?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-9-55'>But Jesus turned and rebuked them,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-9-56'>and 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup> they went to another village.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='57'><li id='verse-9-57'>As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='58'><li id='verse-9-58'>Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='59'><li id='verse-9-59'>He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='60'><li id='verse-9-60'>Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='61'><li id='verse-9-61'>Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='62'><li id='verse-9-62'>Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-10-26'>"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-10-28'>"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-10-29'>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-10-30'>In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-10-31'>A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-10-32'>So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-10-33'>But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-10-34'>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.

<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-10-35'>The next day he took out two silver coins

<h3>Luke 17</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-17-1'>Jesus said to his disciples: "Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-17-2'>It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-17-3'>So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-17-4'>If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, `I repent,' forgive him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-17-5'>The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-17-6'>He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, `Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-17-7'>"Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, `Come along now and sit down to eat'?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-17-8'>Would he not rather say, `Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-17-9'>Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-17-10'>So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, `We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-17-11'>Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-17-12'>As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_1">1</a>]</sup> met him. They stood at a distance
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-17-13'>and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-17-14'>When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-17-15'>One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-17-16'>He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-17-17'>Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-17-18'>Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-17-19'>Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-17-20'>Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-17-21'>nor will people say, `Here it is,' or `There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_2">2</a>]</sup> you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-17-22'>Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-17-23'>Men will tell you, `There he is!' or `Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-17-24'>For the Son of Man in his day 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_3">3</a>]</sup> will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-17-25'>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-17-26'>"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-17-27'>People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-17-28'>"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-17-29'>But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-17-30'>"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-17-31'>On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.

<h3>Luke 18</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-18-1'>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-18-2'>He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-18-3'>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, `Grant me justice against my adversary.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-18-4'>"For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, `Even though I don't fear God or care about men,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-18-5'>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-18-6'>And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-18-7'>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-18-8'>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-18-9'>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-18-10'>"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-18-11'>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_1">1</a>]</sup> himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-18-12'>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-18-13'>"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-18-14'>"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-18-15'>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-18-16'>But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-18-17'>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-18-18'>A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-18-19'>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-18-20'>You know the commandments: `Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.' 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_2">2</a>]</sup> "
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-18-21'>"All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-18-22'>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-18-23'>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-18-24'>Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-18-25'>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-18-26'>Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-18-27'>Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-18-28'>Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-18-29'>"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-18-30'>will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-18-31'>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-18-32'>He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-18-33'>On the third day he will rise again."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-18-34'>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-18-35'>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-18-36'>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-18-37'>They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-18-38'>He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-18-39'>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-18-40'>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-18-41'>"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-18-42'>Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-18-43'>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.

<h3>Luke 19</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-19-1'>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-19-2'>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-19-3'>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-19-4'>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-19-5'>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-19-6'>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-19-7'>All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a `sinner.'"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-19-8'>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-19-9'>Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-19-10'>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-19-11'>While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-19-12'>He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-19-13'>So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_1">1</a>]</sup> `Put this money to work,' he said, `until I come back.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-19-14'>"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, `We don't want this man to be our king.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-19-15'>"He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-19-16'>"The first one came and said, `Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-19-17'>"`Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. `Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-19-18'>"The second came and said, `Sir, your mina has earned five more.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-19-19'>"His master answered, `You take charge of five cities.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-19-20'>"Then another servant came and said, `Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-19-21'>I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-19-22'>"His master replied, `I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-19-23'>Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-19-24'>"Then he said to those standing by, `Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-19-25'>"`Sir,' they said, `he already has ten!'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-19-26'>"He replied, `I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-19-28'>After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-19-32'>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-19-33'>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-19-34'>They replied, "The Lord needs it."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-19-35'>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-19-36'>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-19-37'>When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:

<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-19-38'>"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!"

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-19-39'>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-19-40'>"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-19-41'>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-19-42'>and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.

<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-19-43'>The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-19-45'>Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-19-47'>Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.

<h3>Luke 20</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-20-1'>One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-20-2'>"Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-20-3'>He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-20-4'>John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-20-5'>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will ask, `Why didn't you believe him?'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-20-6'>But if we say, `From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-20-7'>So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-20-8'>Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-20-9'>He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-20-10'>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-20-11'>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-20-12'>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-20-13'>"Then the owner of the vineyard said, `What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-20-14'>"But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. `This is the heir,' they said. `Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-20-15'>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-20-16'>He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-20-17'>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_1">1</a>]</sup> ' 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_2">2</a>]</sup> ?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-20-18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-20-19'>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-20-20'>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-20-21'>So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-20-22'>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-20-23'>He saw through their duplicity and said to them,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-20-24'>"Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-20-25'>"Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-20-26'>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-20-27'>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-20-28'>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-20-29'>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-20-30'>The second
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-20-31'>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-20-32'>Finally, the woman died too.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-20-33'>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-20-34'>Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-20-35'>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-20-36'>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-20-37'>But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord `the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_3">3</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-20-38'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-20-39'>Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-20-40'>And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-20-41'>Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_4">4</a>]</sup> is the Son of David?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-20-42'>David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand

<sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_5">5</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-20-44'>David calls him `Lord.' How then can he be his son?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-20-45'>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-20-46'>"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-22-2'>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-22-3'>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-22-4'>And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-22-5'>They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-22-6'>He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-22-7'>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-22-8'>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-22-9'>"Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-22-10'>He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-22-11'>and say to the owner of the house, `The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'

<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-22-12'>He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-22-13'>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-22-14'>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-22-15'>And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-22-24'>Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-22-25'>Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.

</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-22-41'>He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-22-44'>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-22-47'>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-22-48'>but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-22-49'>When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-22-50'>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-22-51'>But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-22-52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?
</li></ol>

<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-22-54'>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-22-55'>But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-22-56'>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='57'><li id='verse-22-57'>But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='58'><li id='verse-22-58'>A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='59'><li id='verse-22-59'>About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='60'><li id='verse-22-60'>Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='61'><li id='verse-22-61'>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='62'><li id='verse-22-62'>And he went outside and wept bitterly.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='63'><li id='verse-22-63'>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='64'><li id='verse-22-64'>They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='65'><li id='verse-22-65'>And they said many other insulting things to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='66'><li id='verse-22-66'>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.

<ol class='niv' start='67'><li id='verse-22-67'>"If you are the Christ,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='69'><li id='verse-22-69'>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."

<h3>Luke 23</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-23-1'>Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-23-2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_1">1</a>]</sup> a king."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-23-3'>So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-23-4'>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-23-5'>But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_2">2</a>]</sup> by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-23-6'>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-23-7'>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-23-8'>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-23-9'>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-23-10'>The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-23-11'>Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-23-12'>That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-23-13'>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-23-14'>and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-23-15'>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-23-16'>Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.

<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-23-17'>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-23-18'>With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-23-19'>(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-23-20'>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-23-21'>But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-23-22'>For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-23-23'>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-23-24'>So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-23-25'>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-23-26'>As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-23-27'>A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-23-28'>Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-23-29'>For the time will come when you will say, `Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='33'><li id='verse-23-33'>When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='34'><li id='verse-23-34'>Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_5">5</a>]</sup> And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='35'><li id='verse-23-35'>The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='36'><li id='verse-23-36'>The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar

<ol class='niv' start='37'><li id='verse-23-37'>and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='38'><li id='verse-23-38'>There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='39'><li id='verse-23-39'>One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='40'><li id='verse-23-40'>But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='41'><li id='verse-23-41'>We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='42'><li id='verse-23-42'>Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='43'><li id='verse-23-43'>Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='44'><li id='verse-23-44'>It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='45'><li id='verse-23-45'>for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='46'><li id='verse-23-46'>Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='47'><li id='verse-23-47'>The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='48'><li id='verse-23-48'>When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='49'><li id='verse-23-49'>But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='50'><li id='verse-23-50'>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,

<ol class='niv' start='51'><li id='verse-23-51'>who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='52'><li id='verse-23-52'>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='53'><li id='verse-23-53'>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='54'><li id='verse-23-54'>It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='55'><li id='verse-23-55'>The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='56'><li id='verse-23-56'>Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
