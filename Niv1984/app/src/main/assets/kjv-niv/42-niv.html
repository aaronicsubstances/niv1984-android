<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>For nothing is impossible with God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[69]</span> <span>He has raised up a horn </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[72]</span> <span>to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[73]</span> <span>the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[74]</span> <span>to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[75]</span> <span>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[76]</span> <span>And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[77]</span> <span>to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[78]</span> <span>because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[79]</span> <span>to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[80]</span> <span>And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-83'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And everyone went to his own town to register.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> your servant in peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>which you have prepared in the sight of all people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-116'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-117'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-120'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-126'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Which is easier: to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Get up and walk'?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and `sinners'?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-376'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-377'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-383'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-387'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-388'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-389'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-390'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-391'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> which is across the lake from Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For Jesus had commanded the evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-404'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-406'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-408'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-409'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-4" id="niv-verse-8-4">d</a>]</sup><span> but no one could heal her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-412'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-688'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-689'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-690'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-691'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-692'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-693'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And they had nothing to say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-694'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-695'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-696'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, `Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-697'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, `Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-698'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-699'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-700'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-701'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-702'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-703'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-704'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, `Come, for everything is now ready.'</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, `Grant me justice against my adversary.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, `Even though I don't fear God or care about men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-855'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-856'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-926'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-927'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>"Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-928'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-929'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-930'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, `From heaven,' he will ask, `Why didn't you believe him?'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-931'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But if we say, `From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-932'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-933'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-934'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-935'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-936'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-937'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-938'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"Then the owner of the vineyard said, `What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-939'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>"But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. `This is the heir,' they said. `Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-940'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-941'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-942'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-2" id="niv-verse-20-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-943'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-944'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-945'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-946'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-947'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-948'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>He saw through their duplicity and said to them,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-950'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-951'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-952'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-953'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-954'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-955'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>The second</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-956'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-957'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Finally, the woman died too.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-958'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-959'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-960'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-961'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-962'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord `the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-3" id="niv-verse-20-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-963'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-964'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-965'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-966'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-4" id="niv-verse-20-4">d</a>]</sup><span> is the Son of David?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-967'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1062'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1063'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1072'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1075'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1076'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1077'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1080'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1089'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1090'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1091'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1093'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1094'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1095'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1096'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1109'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1162'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1163'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1164'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1165'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1168'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1169'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1170'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1172'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1173'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1174'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1175'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-1189'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</span></div>
