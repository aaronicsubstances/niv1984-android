<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>The same was in the beginning with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>There was a man sent from God, whose name </span><i>was</i><span> John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all </span><i>men</i><span> through him might believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>He was not that Light, but </span><i>was sent</i><span> to bear witness of that Light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <i>That</i><span> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, </span><i>even</i><span> to them that believe on his name:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For the law was given by Moses, </span><i>but</i><span> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>He said, I </span><i>am</i><span> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">What seek ye?</span><span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>He saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Come and see.</span><span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>One of the two which heard John </span><i>speak</i><span>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, </span><span class="wj">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</span><span> which is by interpretation, A stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Follow me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[47] <span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, </span><span class="wj">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[48] <span>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[49] <span>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[50] <span>Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[51] <span>And he saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[1] <span>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[2] <span>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[3] <span>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[4] <span>Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[6] <span>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[7] <span>Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Fill the waterpots with water.</span><span> And they filled them up to the brim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[8] <span>And he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</span><span> And they bare </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[9] <span>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[10] <span>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: </span><i>but</i><span> thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[11] <span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[12] <span>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'>[13] <span>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'>[14] <span>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'>[15] <span>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[16] <span>And said unto them that sold doves, </span><span class="wj">Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'>[17] <span>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[18] <span>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[19] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'>[20] <span>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'>[21] <span>But he spake of the temple of his body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'>[22] <span>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'>[23] <span>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast </span><i>day</i><span>, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-82'>[1] <span>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-83'>[2] <span>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'>[4] <span>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-86'>[5] <span>Jesus answered, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and </span><i class="wj">of</i><span class="wj"> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'>[6] <span class="wj">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-90'>[9] <span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-91'>[10] <span>Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-95'>[14] <span class="wj">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-96'>[15] <span class="wj">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-97'>[16] <span class="wj">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-98'>[17] <span class="wj">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-99'>[18] <span class="wj">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-100'>[19] <span class="wj">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-101'>[20] <span class="wj">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-102'>[21] <span class="wj">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-103'>[22] <span>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-177'>[2] <span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep </span><i>market</i><span> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-178'>[3] <span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-298'>[1] <span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-299'>[2] <span>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-300'>[3] <span>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-301'>[4] <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> no man </span><i>that</i><span> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-302'>[5] <span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-303'>[6] <span>Then Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-304'>[7] <span class="wj">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-305'>[8] <span class="wj">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-306'>[9] <span>When he had said these words unto them, he abode </span><i>still</i><span> in Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-307'>[10] <span>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-308'>[11] <span>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-309'>[12] <span>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-310'>[13] <span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-311'>[14] <span>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-312'>[15] <span>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-313'>[16] <span>Jesus answered them, and said, </span><span class="wj">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-317'>[20] <span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-318'>[21] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-319'>[22] <span class="wj">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-320'>[23] <span class="wj">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-324'>[27] <span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-325'>[28] <span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, </span><span class="wj">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-326'>[29] <span class="wj">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-327'>[30] <span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-328'>[31] <span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this </span><i>man</i><span> hath done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-329'>[32] <span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-330'>[33] <span>Then said Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">Yet a little while am I with you, and </span><i class="wj">then</i><span class="wj"> I go unto him that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-331'>[34] <span class="wj">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find </span><i class="wj">me</i><span class="wj">: and where I am, </span><i class="wj">thither</i><span class="wj"> ye cannot come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-332'>[35] <span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-333'>[36] <span>What </span><i>manner of</i><span> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find </span><i>me</i><span>: and where I am, </span><i>thither</i><span> ye cannot come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-334'>[37] <span>In the last day, that great </span><i>day</i><span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, </span><span class="wj">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-335'>[38] <span class="wj">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-336'>[39] <span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet </span><i>given</i><span>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'>[40] <span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-338'>[41] <span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-339'>[42] <span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-340'>[43] <span>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-341'>[44] <span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-342'>[45] <span>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-343'>[46] <span>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-344'>[47] <span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-345'>[48] <span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-346'>[49] <span>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-347'>[50] <span>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-361'>[9] <span>And they which heard </span><i>it</i><span>, being convicted by </span><i>their own</i><span> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, </span><i>even</i><span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-362'>[10] <span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-413'>Chapter 9</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-414'>[1] <span>And as </span><i>Jesus</i><span> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from </span><i>his</i><span> birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-415'>[2] <span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-416'>[3] <span>Jesus answered, </span><span class="wj">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-417'>[4] <span class="wj">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-418'>[5] <span class="wj">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-419'>[6] <span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-420'>[7] <span>And said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span><span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-421'>[8] <span>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-422'>[9] <span>Some said, This is he: others </span><i>said</i><span>, He is like him: </span><i>but</i><span> he said, I am </span><i>he</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-423'>[10] <span>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-424'>[11] <span>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-425'>[12] <span>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-426'>[13] <span>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-427'>[14] <span>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-428'>[15] <span>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-429'>[16] <span>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-430'>[17] <span>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-431'>[18] <span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-432'>[19] <span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-433'>[20] <span>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-434'>[21] <span>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-435'>[22] <span>These </span><i>words</i><span> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-436'>[23] <span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-437'>[24] <span>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-438'>[25] <span>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner </span><i>or no</i><span>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-439'>[26] <span>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-440'>[27] <span>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear </span><i>it</i><span> again? will ye also be his disciples?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-441'>[28] <span>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-442'>[29] <span>We know that God spake unto Moses: </span><i>as for</i><span> this </span><i>fellow</i><span>, we know not from whence he is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-443'>[30] <span>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and </span><i>yet</i><span> he hath opened mine eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-444'>[31] <span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-445'>[32] <span>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-446'>[33] <span>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-447'>[34] <span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-448'>[35] <span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-449'>[36] <span>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-450'>[37] <span>And Jesus said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-451'>[38] <span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-452'>[39] <span>And Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-453'>[40] <span>And </span><i>some</i><span> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-454'>[41] <span>Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-457'>[1] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-458'>[2] <span class="wj">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-469'>[13] <span class="wj">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-470'>[14] <span class="wj">I am the good shepherd, and know my </span><i class="wj">sheep</i><span class="wj">, and am known of mine.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-473'>[17] <span class="wj">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-474'>[18] <span class="wj">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-475'>[19] <span>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-476'>[20] <span>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-477'>[21] <span>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-478'>[22] <span>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-479'>[23] <span>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-480'>[24] <span>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-481'>[25] <span>Jesus answered them, </span><span class="wj">I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-491'>[35] <span class="wj">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-492'>[36] <span class="wj">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-560'>[1] <span>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-561'>[2] <span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-562'>[3] <span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-564'>[5] <span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-565'>[6] <span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-566'>[7] <span>Then said Jesus, </span><span class="wj">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-568'>[9] <span>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-569'>[10] <span>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-570'>[11] <span>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-571'>[12] <span>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-572'>[13] <span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-573'>[14] <span>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-574'>[15] <span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-575'>[16] <span>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and </span><i>that</i><span> they had done these things unto him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-579'>[20] <span>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-580'>[21] <span>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-582'>[23] <span>And Jesus answered them, saying, </span><span class="wj">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-583'>[24] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-587'>[28] <span class="wj">Father, glorify thy name.</span><span> Then came there a voice from heaven, </span><i>saying</i><span>, I have both glorified </span><i>it</i><span>, and will glorify </span><i>it</i><span> again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-588'>[29] <span>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard </span><i>it</i><span>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-589'>[30] <span>Jesus answered and said, </span><span class="wj">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-590'>[31] <span class="wj">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-592'>[33] <span>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-593'>[34] <span>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-594'>[35] <span>Then Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-595'>[36] <span class="wj">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span><span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-596'>[37] <span>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-599'>[40] <span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with </span><i>their</i><span> eyes, nor understand with </span><i>their</i><span> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-600'>[41] <span>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-601'>[42] <span>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess </span><i>him</i><span>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-602'>[43] <span>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-603'>[44] <span>Jesus cried and said, </span><span class="wj">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-820'>[2] <span>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put </span><i>it</i><span> on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-825'>[7] <span>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-827'>[9] <span>And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-830'>[12] <span>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-831'>[13] <span>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-832'>[14] <span>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-834'>[16] <span>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led </span><i>him</i><span> away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-835'>[17] <span>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called </span><i>the place</i><span> of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-837'>[19] <span>And Pilate wrote a title, and put </span><i>it</i><span> on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-838'>[20] <span>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, </span><i>and</i><span> Greek, </span><i>and</i><span> Latin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-839'>[21] <span>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-840'>[22] <span>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-841'>[23] <span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also </span><i>his</i><span> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-842'>[24] <span>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-843'>[25] <span>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the </span><i>wife</i><span> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-844'>[26] <span>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, </span><span class="wj">Woman, behold thy son!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-845'>[27] <span>Then saith he to the disciple, </span><span class="wj">Behold thy mother!</span><span> And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own </span><i>home</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-846'>[28] <span>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, </span><span class="wj">I thirst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-847'>[29] <span>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put </span><i>it</i><span> upon hyssop, and put </span><i>it</i><span> to his mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-848'>[30] <span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, </span><span class="wj">It is finished:</span><span> and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-849'>[31] <span>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and </span><i>that</i><span> they might be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'>[32] <span>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-851'>[33] <span>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-852'>[34] <span>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-853'>[35] <span>And he that saw </span><i>it</i><span> bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-854'>[36] <span>For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-856'>[38] <span>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave </span><i>him</i><span> leave.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-857'>[39] <span>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound </span><i>weight</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-858'>[40] <span>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-859'>[41] <span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-873'>[11] <span>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, </span><i>and looked</i><span> into the sepulchre,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-880'>[18] <span>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and </span><i>that</i><span> he had spoken these things unto her.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-882'>[20] <span>And when he had so said, he shewed unto them </span><i>his</i><span> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-888'>[26] <span>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: </span><i>then</i><span> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, </span><span class="wj">Peace </span><i class="wj">be</i><span class="wj"> unto you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-897'>[2] <span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the </span><i>sons</i><span> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-903'>[8] <span>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-904'>[9] <span>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-908'>[13] <span>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</span></div>

And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Feed my sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-913'>[18] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj"> whither thou wouldest not.</span></div>
