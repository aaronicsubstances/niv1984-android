<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <i>That</i><span> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, </span><i>even</i><span> to them that believe on his name:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">What seek ye?</span><span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Come and see.</span><span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>One of the two which heard John </span><i>speak</i><span>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, </span><span class="wj">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</span><span> which is by interpretation, A stone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Follow me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, </span><span class="wj">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Jesus answered and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>And he saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</span></div>
