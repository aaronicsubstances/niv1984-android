<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>He was with God in the beginning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>children born not of natural descent, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-7" id="niv-verse-1-7">g</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, `Make straight the way for the Lord.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-8" id="niv-verse-1-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Now some Pharisees who had been sent</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>"I baptize with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-9" id="niv-verse-1-9">i</a>]</sup><span> water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>This is the one I meant when I said, `A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[33] <span>I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, `The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[34] <span>I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[35] <span>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[36] <span>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[37] <span>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[38] <span>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[39] <span>"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[40] <span>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[41] <span>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[42] <span>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-10" id="niv-verse-1-10">j</a>]</sup><span> ).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[43] <span>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[44] <span>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[45] <span>Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[46] <span>"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[47] <span>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[48] <span>"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[49] <span>Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[50] <span>Jesus said, "You believe </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-11" id="niv-verse-1-11">k</a>]</sup><span> because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[51] <span>He then added, "I tell you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-12" id="niv-verse-1-12">l</a>]</sup><span> the truth, you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-13" id="niv-verse-1-13">m</a>]</sup><span> shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-54'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[1] <span>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[2] <span>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[3] <span>When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[4] <span>"Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[5] <span>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[6] <span>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[7] <span>Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[8] <span>Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[9] <span>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[10] <span>and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[11] <span>This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[12] <span>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[13] <span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[14] <span>In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[15] <span>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[16] <span>To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[17] <span>His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[18] <span>Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[19] <span>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[4] <span>"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[5] <span>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[17] <span>"I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'>[18] <span>The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[19] <span>"Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[20] <span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[21] <span>Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[22] <span>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[23] <span>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[24] <span>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[25] <span>The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[26] <span>Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[27] <span>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'>[28] <span>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[29] <span>"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[30] <span>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[31] <span>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[32] <span>But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[33] <span>Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'>[34] <span>"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[35] <span>Do you not say, `Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[36] <span>Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[37] <span>Thus the saying `One sows and another reaps' is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[38] <span>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[39] <span>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[40] <span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[41] <span>And because of his words many more became believers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[42] <span>They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[43] <span>After the two days he left for Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[44] <span>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[45] <span>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[46] <span>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[47] <span>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[48] <span>"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[49] <span>The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[50] <span>Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[51] <span>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[52] <span>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'>[53] <span>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'>[54] <span>This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-120'>[1] <span>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-121'>[2] <span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-122'>[3] <span>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-123'>[4] <span>And he must needs go through Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-124'>[5] <span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-125'>[6] <span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with </span><i>his</i><span> journey, sat thus on the well: </span><i>and</i><span> it was about the sixth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-126'>[7] <span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Give me to drink.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-128'>[9] <span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-129'>[10] <span>Jesus answered and said unto her, </span><span class="wj">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-130'>[11] <span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-134'>[15] <span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-138'>[19] <span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'>[20] <span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-140'>[21] <span>Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-141'>[22] <span class="wj">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-142'>[23] <span class="wj">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-143'>[24] <span class="wj">God </span><i class="wj">is</i><span class="wj"> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship </span><i class="wj">him</i><span class="wj"> in spirit and in truth.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-146'>[27] <span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-147'>[28] <span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-148'>[29] <span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-149'>[30] <span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-150'>[31] <span>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-151'>[32] <span>But he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-152'>[33] <span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him </span><i>ought</i><span> to eat?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-153'>[34] <span>Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-154'>[35] <span class="wj">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and </span><i class="wj">then</i><span class="wj"> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-155'>[36] <span class="wj">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-156'>[37] <span class="wj">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-157'>[38] <span class="wj">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-158'>[39] <span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-159'>[40] <span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-160'>[41] <span>And many more believed because of his own word;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-161'>[42] <span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard </span><i>him</i><span> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-162'>[43] <span>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-163'>[44] <span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-164'>[45] <span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-165'>[46] <span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-166'>[47] <span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-167'>[48] <span>Then said Jesus unto him, </span><span class="wj">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-168'>[49] <span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-169'>[50] <span>Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span><span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-175'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'>[1] <span>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'>[2] <span>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'>[3] <span>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'>[4] </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'>[5] <span>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'>[6] <span>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'>[7] <span>"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'>[8] <span>Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'>[9] <span>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'>[10] <span>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'>[11] <span>But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, `Pick up your mat and walk.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'>[12] <span>So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'>[13] <span>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'>[14] <span>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'>[15] <span>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'>[16] <span>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[17] <span>Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[18] <span>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[19] <span>Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'>[20] <span>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-196'>[21] <span>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-197'>[22] <span>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-198'>[23] <span>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'>[24] <span>"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-200'>[25] <span>I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-201'>[26] <span>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-202'>[27] <span>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-203'>[28] <span>"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-204'>[29] <span>and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-205'>[30] <span>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-206'>[31] <span>"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-207'>[32] <span>There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-208'>[33] <span>"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-209'>[34] <span>Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-210'>[35] <span>John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-211'>[36] <span>"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-212'>[37] <span>And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-213'>[38] <span>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-214'>[39] <span>You diligently study </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-215'>[40] <span>yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-216'>[41] <span>"I do not accept praise from men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-217'>[42] <span>but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-218'>[43] <span>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-219'>[44] <span>How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-4" id="niv-verse-5-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-175'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-176'>[1] <span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-177'>[2] <span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep </span><i>market</i><span> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-178'>[3] <span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-179'>[4] <span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-180'>[5] <span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-181'>[6] <span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time </span><i>in that case</i><span>, he saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Wilt thou be made whole?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-182'>[7] <span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-183'>[8] <span>Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-184'>[9] <span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-185'>[10] <span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry </span><i>thy</i><span> bed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-186'>[11] <span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-187'>[12] <span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-188'>[13] <span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in </span><i>that</i><span> place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-189'>[14] <span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-190'>[15] <span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-191'>[16] <span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-192'>[17] <span>But Jesus answered them, </span><span class="wj">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-193'>[18] <span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-194'>[19] <span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-195'>[20] <span class="wj">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-196'>[21] <span class="wj">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj">; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-197'>[22] <span class="wj">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-200'>[25] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-201'>[26] <span class="wj">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-202'>[27] <span class="wj">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-203'>[28] <span class="wj">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-204'>[29] <span class="wj">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-205'>[30] <span class="wj">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-206'>[31] <span class="wj">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-207'>[32] <span class="wj">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-210'>[35] <span class="wj">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-211'>[36] <span class="wj">But I have greater witness than </span><i class="wj">that</i><span class="wj"> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-212'>[37] <span class="wj">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-224'>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'>[1] <span>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'>[2] <span>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'>[3] <span>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'>[4] <span>The Jewish Passover Feast was near.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'>[5] <span>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'>[6] <span>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'>[7] <span>Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'>[8] <span>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'>[9] <span>"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'>[10] <span>Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'>[11] <span>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'>[12] <span>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'>[13] <span>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'>[14] <span>After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'>[15] <span>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'>[16] <span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'>[17] <span>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'>[18] <span>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[19] <span>When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[20] <span>But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[21] <span>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[22] <span>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[23] <span>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[24] <span>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[25] <span>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[26] <span>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[27] <span>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[28] <span>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[29] <span>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'>[30] <span>So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'>[31] <span>Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'>[32] <span>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'>[33] <span>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[34] <span>"Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[35] <span>Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[36] <span>But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[37] <span>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'>[38] <span>For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'>[39] <span>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'>[40] <span>For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'>[41] <span>At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'>[42] <span>They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, `I came down from heaven'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'>[43] <span>"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'>[44] <span>"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[45] <span>It is written in the Prophets: `They will all be taught by God.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[46] <span>No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[47] <span>I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[48] <span>I am the bread of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'>[49] <span>Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[50] <span>But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'>[51] <span>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-276'>[52] <span>Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'>[53] <span>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'>[54] <span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'>[55] <span>For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'>[56] <span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'>[57] <span>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'>[58] <span>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283'>[59] <span>He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'>[60] <span>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'>[61] <span>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'>[62] <span>What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'>[63] <span>The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-5" id="niv-verse-6-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and they are life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'>[64] <span>Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'>[65] <span>He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'>[66] <span>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'>[67] <span>"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'>[68] <span>Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293'>[69] <span>We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294'>[70] <span>Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'>[71] <span>(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-234'>[10] <span>And Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Make the men sit down.</span><span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-235'>[11] <span>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-236'>[12] <span>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, </span><span class="wj">Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-237'>[13] <span>Therefore they gathered </span><i>them</i><span> together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-238'>[14] <span>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-239'>[15] <span>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-240'>[16] <span>And when even was </span><i>now</i><span> come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-241'>[17] <span>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-242'>[18] <span>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-243'>[19] <span>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-244'>[20] <span>But he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">It is I; be not afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-245'>[21] <span>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-246'>[22] <span>The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but </span><i>that</i><span> his disciples were gone away alone;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-247'>[23] <span>(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-248'>[24] <span>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-249'>[25] <span>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-250'>[26] <span>Jesus answered them and said, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-251'>[27] <span class="wj">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-252'>[28] <span>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-253'>[29] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-254'>[30] <span>They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-255'>[31] <span>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-256'>[32] <span>Then Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-257'>[33] <span class="wj">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-258'>[34] <span>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-259'>[35] <span>And Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-260'>[36] <span class="wj">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-261'>[37] <span class="wj">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-262'>[38] <span class="wj">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-263'>[39] <span class="wj">And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-264'>[40] <span class="wj">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-265'>[41] <span>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-266'>[42] <span>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-267'>[43] <span>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Murmur not among yourselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-268'>[44] <span class="wj">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-269'>[45] <span class="wj">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-270'>[46] <span class="wj">Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-271'>[47] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-272'>[48] <span class="wj">I am that bread of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-273'>[49] <span class="wj">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-274'>[50] <span class="wj">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-275'>[51] <span class="wj">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-276'>[52] <span>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us </span><i>his</i><span> flesh to eat?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-277'>[53] <span>Then Jesus said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-278'>[54] <span class="wj">Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-279'>[55] <span class="wj">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-282'>[58] <span class="wj">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-283'>[59] <span>These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-284'>[60] <span>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard </span><i>this</i><span>, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-285'>[61] <span>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Doth this offend you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-286'>[62] <i class="wj">What</i><span class="wj"> and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-287'>[63] <span class="wj">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, </span><i class="wj">they</i><span class="wj"> are spirit, and </span><i class="wj">they</i><span class="wj"> are life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-288'>[64] <span class="wj">But there are some of you that believe not.</span><span> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-289'>[65] <span>And he said, </span><span class="wj">Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-290'>[66] <span>From that </span><i>time</i><span> many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-291'>[67] <span>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, </span><span class="wj">Will ye also go away?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-292'>[68] <span>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-297'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298'>[1] <span>After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-299'>[2] <span>But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'>[3] <span>Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'>[4] <span>No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[5] <span>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[6] <span>Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[7] <span>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[8] <span>You go to the Feast. I am not yet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[9] <span>Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[10] <span>However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[11] <span>Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[12] <span>Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'>[13] <span>But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[14] <span>Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'>[15] <span>The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'>[16] <span>Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-314'>[17] <span>If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'>[18] <span>He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316'>[19] <span>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317'>[20] <span>"You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'>[21] <span>Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'>[22] <span>Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320'>[23] <span>Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321'>[24] <span>Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'>[25] <span>At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'>[26] <span>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'>[27] <span>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'>[28] <span>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'>[29] <span>but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327'>[30] <span>At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328'>[31] <span>Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329'>[32] <span>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'>[33] <span>Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331'>[34] <span>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332'>[35] <span>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333'>[36] <span>What did he mean when he said, `You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and `Where I am, you cannot come'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'>[37] <span>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'>[38] <span>Whoever believes in me, as </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'>[39] <span>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'>[40] <span>On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'>[41] <span>Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'>[42] <span>Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'>[43] <span>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-341'>[44] <span>Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-342'>[45] <span>Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'>[46] <span>"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'>[47] <span>"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'>[48] <span>"Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'>[49] <span>No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'>[50] <span>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'>[51] <span>"Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'>[52] <span>They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-5" id="niv-verse-7-5">e</a>]</sup><span> does not come out of Galilee."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'>[53] <sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-6" id="niv-verse-7-6">f</a>]</sup><span> Then each went to his own home.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-298'>[1] <span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-313'>[16] <span>Jesus answered them, and said, </span><span class="wj">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-314'>[17] <span class="wj">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or </span><i class="wj">whether</i><span class="wj"> I speak of myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-315'>[18] <span class="wj">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-316'>[19] <span class="wj">Did not Moses give you the law, and </span><i class="wj">yet</i><span class="wj"> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-317'>[20] <span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-318'>[21] <span>Jesus answered and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-319'>[22] <span class="wj">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-320'>[23] <span class="wj">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-321'>[24] <span class="wj">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-322'>[25] <span>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-323'>[26] <span>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-324'>[27] <span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-325'>[28] <span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, </span><span class="wj">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-326'>[29] <span class="wj">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-327'>[30] <span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-328'>[31] <span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this </span><i>man</i><span> hath done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-329'>[32] <span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-330'>[33] <span>Then said Jesus unto them, </span><span class="wj">Yet a little while am I with you, and </span><i class="wj">then</i><span class="wj"> I go unto him that sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-331'>[34] <span class="wj">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find </span><i class="wj">me</i><span class="wj">: and where I am, </span><i class="wj">thither</i><span class="wj"> ye cannot come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-332'>[35] <span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-333'>[36] <span>What </span><i>manner of</i><span> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find </span><i>me</i><span>: and where I am, </span><i>thither</i><span> ye cannot come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-334'>[37] <span>In the last day, that great </span><i>day</i><span> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, </span><span class="wj">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-335'>[38] <span class="wj">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-336'>[39] <span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet </span><i>given</i><span>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-337'>[40] <span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-338'>[41] <span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-339'>[42] <span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-340'>[43] <span>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-341'>[44] <span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-342'>[45] <span>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-343'>[46] <span>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-344'>[47] <span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-345'>[48] <span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-346'>[49] <span>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-347'>[50] <span>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-348'>[51] <span>Doth our law judge </span><i>any</i><span> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-349'>[52] <span>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-350'>[53] <span>And every man went unto his own house.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-352'>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'>[1] <span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'>[2] <span>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'>[3] <span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'>[4] <span>and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'>[5] <span>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'>[6] <span>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'>[7] <span>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'>[8] <span>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'>[9] <span>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'>[10] <span>Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'>[11] <span>"No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'>[12] <span>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'>[13] <span>The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'>[14] <span>Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'>[15] <span>You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'>[16] <span>But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'>[17] <span>In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'>[18] <span>I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'>[19] <span>Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'>[20] <span>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'>[21] <span>Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'>[22] <span>This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, `Where I go, you cannot come'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'>[23] <span>But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-376'>[24] <span>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am [the one I claim to be], </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> you will indeed die in your sins."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-377'>[25] <span>"Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378'>[26] <span>"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'>[27] <span>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'>[28] <span>So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [the one I claim to be] and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'>[29] <span>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-382'>[30] <span>Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-383'>[31] <span>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-384'>[32] <span>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'>[33] <span>They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'>[34] <span>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-387'>[35] <span>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-388'>[36] <span>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-389'>[37] <span>I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-390'>[38] <span>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-391'>[39] <span>"Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-4" id="niv-verse-8-4">d</a>]</sup><span> do the things Abraham did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'>[40] <span>As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'>[41] <span>You are doing the things your own father does." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'>[42] <span>Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'>[43] <span>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'>[44] <span>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'>[45] <span>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'>[46] <span>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'>[47] <span>He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'>[48] <span>The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'>[49] <span>"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-402'>[50] <span>I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-403'>[51] <span>I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-404'>[52] <span>At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'>[53] <span>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-406'>[54] <span>Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-407'>[55] <span>Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-408'>[56] <span>Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-409'>[57] <span>"You are not yet fifty years old," the Jews said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'>[58] <span>"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'>[59] <span>At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-354'>[2] <span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-355'>[3] <span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-357'>[5] <span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-358'>[6] <span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with </span><i>his</i><span> finger wrote on the ground, </span><i>as though he heard them not</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-359'>[7] <span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-360'>[8] <span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-361'>[9] <span>And they which heard </span><i>it</i><span>, being convicted by </span><i>their own</i><span> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, </span><i>even</i><span> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-362'>[10] <span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-363'>[11] <span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, </span><span class="wj">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-364'>[12] <span>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, </span><span class="wj">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-386'>[34] <span>Jesus answered them, </span><span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'>[1] <span>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'>[2] <span>His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'>[3] <span>"Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'>[4] <span>As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'>[5] <span>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'>[6] <span>Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'>[7] <span>"Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'>[8] <span>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'>[9] <span>Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'>[10] <span>"How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'>[11] <span>He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'>[12] <span>"Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'>[13] <span>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'>[14] <span>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-428'>[15] <span>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-429'>[16] <span>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-430'>[17] <span>Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-431'>[18] <span>The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-432'>[19] <span>"Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-433'>[20] <span>"We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-434'>[21] <span>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-435'>[22] <span>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> would be put out of the synagogue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-436'>[23] <span>That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-437'>[24] <span>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">b</a>]</sup><span> " they said. "We know this man is a sinner."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-438'>[25] <span>He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-439'>[26] <span>Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-440'>[27] <span>He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-441'>[28] <span>Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-442'>[29] <span>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-443'>[30] <span>The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-444'>[31] <span>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-445'>[32] <span>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-446'>[33] <span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-447'>[34] <span>To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-448'>[35] <span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-449'>[36] <span>"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-450'>[37] <span>Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-451'>[38] <span>Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-452'>[39] <span>Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-453'>[40] <span>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-454'>[41] <span>Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-481'>[25] <span>Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-488'>[32] <span>but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-489'>[33] <span>"We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-490'>[34] <span>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, `I have said you are gods' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">e</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-500'>Chapter 11</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'>[1] <span>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'>[2] <span>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'>[3] <span>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'>[4] <span>When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'>[5] <span>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'>[6] <span>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'>[7] <span>Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'>[8] <span>"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'>[9] <span>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'>[10] <span>It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'>[11] <span>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'>[12] <span>His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'>[13] <span>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'>[14] <span>So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'>[15] <span>and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'>[16] <span>Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'>[17] <span>On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-518'>[18] <span>Bethany was less than two miles </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> from Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'>[19] <span>and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'>[20] <span>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'>[21] <span>"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-522'>[22] <span>But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'>[23] <span>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'>[24] <span>Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'>[25] <span>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'>[26] <span>and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'>[27] <span>"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'>[28] <span>And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'>[29] <span>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-530'>[30] <span>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-531'>[31] <span>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'>[32] <span>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'>[33] <span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'>[34] <span>"Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'>[35] <span>Jesus wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'>[36] <span>Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'>[37] <span>But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'>[38] <span>Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'>[39] <span>"Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'>[40] <span>Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'>[41] <span>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'>[42] <span>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'>[43] <span>When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'>[44] <span>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'>[45] <span>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'>[46] <span>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'>[47] <span>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'>[48] <span>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and our nation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'>[49] <span>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'>[50] <span>You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'>[51] <span>He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'>[52] <span>and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'>[53] <span>So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'>[54] <span>Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'>[55] <span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'>[56] <span>They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'>[57] <span>But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-511'>[11] <span>These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-512'>[12] <span>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-513'>[13] <span>Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-514'>[14] <span>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, </span><span class="wj">Lazarus is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-515'>[15] <span class="wj">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-516'>[16] <span>Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-517'>[17] <span>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had </span><i>lain</i><span> in the grave four days already.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-518'>[18] <span>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-519'>[19] <span>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-520'>[20] <span>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat </span><i>still</i><span> in the house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-521'>[21] <span>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-522'>[22] <span>But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give </span><i>it</i><span> thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-523'>[23] <span>Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Thy brother shall rise again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-524'>[24] <span>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-525'>[25] <span>Jesus said unto her, </span><span class="wj">I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-526'>[26] <span class="wj">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-527'>[27] <span>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-528'>[28] <span>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-529'>[29] <span>As soon as she heard </span><i>that</i><span>, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-530'>[30] <span>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-531'>[31] <span>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-532'>[32] <span>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-533'>[33] <span>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-534'>[34] <span>And said, </span><span class="wj">Where have ye laid him?</span><span> They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-535'>[35] <span>Jesus wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-536'>[36] <span>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-537'>[37] <span>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-538'>[38] <span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-539'>[39] <span>Jesus said, </span><span class="wj">Take ye away the stone.</span><span> Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been </span><i>dead</i><span> four days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-540'>[40] <span>Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-541'>[41] <span>Then they took away the stone </span><i>from the place</i><span> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up </span><i>his</i><span> eyes, and said, </span><span class="wj">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-542'>[42] <span class="wj">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-543'>[43] <span>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, </span><span class="wj">Lazarus, come forth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-544'>[44] <span>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">Loose him, and let him go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-545'>[45] <span>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-546'>[46] <span>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-547'>[47] <span>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-548'>[48] <span>If we let him thus alone, all </span><i>men</i><span> will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-549'>[49] <span>And one of them, </span><i>named</i><span> Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-550'>[50] <span>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-551'>[51] <span>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-552'>[52] <span>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-553'>[53] <span>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-554'>[54] <span>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-555'>[55] <span>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-556'>[56] <span>Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-557'>[57] <span>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew </span><i>it</i><span>, that they might take him.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-559'>Chapter 12</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'>[1] <span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'>[2] <span>Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'>[3] <span>Then Mary took about a pint </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-563'>[4] <span>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-564'>[5] <span>"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-2" id="niv-verse-12-2">b</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'>[6] <span>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-566'>[7] <span>"Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "[It was intended] that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-567'>[8] <span>You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-568'>[9] <span>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-569'>[10] <span>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-570'>[11] <span>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-571'>[12] <span>The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-572'>[13] <span>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-3" id="niv-verse-12-3">c</a>]</sup><span> " "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-4" id="niv-verse-12-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "Blessed is the King of Israel!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-573'>[14] <span>Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-574'>[15] <span>"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-5" id="niv-verse-12-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-575'>[16] <span>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-576'>[17] <span>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'>[18] <span>Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-578'>[19] <span>So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'>[20] <span>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'>[21] <span>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-581'>[22] <span>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'>[23] <span>Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'>[24] <span>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'>[25] <span>The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-585'>[26] <span>Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-586'>[27] <span>"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? `Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'>[28] <span>Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'>[29] <span>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'>[30] <span>Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'>[31] <span>Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-591'>[32] <span>But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'>[33] <span>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'>[34] <span>The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-6" id="niv-verse-12-6">f</a>]</sup><span> will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'>[35] <span>Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'>[36] <span>Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'>[37] <span>Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'>[38] <span>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-7" id="niv-verse-12-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'>[39] <span>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'>[40] <span>"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-8" id="niv-verse-12-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-600'>[41] <span>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-601'>[42] <span>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'>[43] <span>for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'>[44] <span>Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-604'>[45] <span>When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'>[46] <span>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'>[47] <span>"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'>[48] <span>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'>[49] <span>For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-609'>[50] <span>I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-560'>[1] <span>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-561'>[2] <span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-562'>[3] <span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-563'>[4] <span>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's </span><i>son</i><span>, which should betray him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-564'>[5] <span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-565'>[6] <span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-566'>[7] <span>Then said Jesus, </span><span class="wj">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-567'>[8] <span class="wj">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-568'>[9] <span>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-569'>[10] <span>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-570'>[11] <span>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-571'>[12] <span>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-572'>[13] <span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-573'>[14] <span>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-575'>[16] <span>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and </span><i>that</i><span> they had done these things unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-576'>[17] <span>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-577'>[18] <span>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-578'>[19] <span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-579'>[20] <span>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-580'>[21] <span>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-582'>[23] <span>And Jesus answered them, saying, </span><span class="wj">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-611'>Chapter 13</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'>[1] <span>It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'>[2] <span>The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'>[3] <span>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'>[4] <span>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'>[5] <span>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'>[6] <span>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-618'>[7] <span>Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'>[8] <span>"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'>[9] <span>"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'>[10] <span>Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'>[11] <span>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'>[12] <span>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'>[13] <span>"You call me `Teacher' and `Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-625'>[14] <span>Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-626'>[15] <span>I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-627'>[16] <span>I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-628'>[17] <span>Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-629'>[18] <span>"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture: `He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-630'>[19] <span>"I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-631'>[20] <span>I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-632'>[21] <span>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-633'>[22] <span>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-634'>[23] <span>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-635'>[24] <span>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-636'>[25] <span>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'>[26] <span>Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'>[27] <span>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'>[28] <span>but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'>[29] <span>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-641'>[30] <span>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-642'>[31] <span>When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-643'>[32] <span>If God is glorified in him, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-3" id="niv-verse-13-3">c</a>]</sup><span> God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-644'>[33] <span>"My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-645'>[34] <span>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-646'>[35] <span>By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-647'>[36] <span>Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-648'>[37] <span>Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-649'>[38] <span>Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-612'>[1] <span>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-613'>[2] <span>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's </span><i>son</i><span>, to betray him;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-777'>[1] <span>When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-778'>[2] <span>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-779'>[3] <span>So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-780'>[4] <span>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-781'>[5] <span>"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-782'>[6] <span>When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-783'>[7] <span>Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-784'>[8] <span>"I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-785'>[9] <span>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-786'>[10] <span>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-787'>[11] <span>Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-788'>[12] <span>Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-789'>[13] <span>and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-790'>[14] <span>Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-791'>[15] <span>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-792'>[16] <span>but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-793'>[17] <span>"You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-794'>[18] <span>It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-795'>[19] <span>Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-796'>[20] <span>"I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-797'>[21] <span>Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-798'>[22] <span>When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-799'>[23] <span>"If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-800'>[24] <span>Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-801'>[25] <span>As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-802'>[26] <span>One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-803'>[27] <span>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'>[28] <span>Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805'>[29] <span>So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'>[30] <span>"If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'>[31] <span>Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'>[32] <span>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'>[33] <span>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810'>[34] <span>"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-811'>[35] <span>"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812'>[36] <span>Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813'>[37] <span>"You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814'>[38] <span>"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'>[39] <span>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release `the king of the Jews'?"</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-776'>Chapter 18</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-777'>[1] <span>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-778'>[2] <span>And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-779'>[3] <span>Judas then, having received a band </span><i>of men</i><span> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-780'>[4] <span>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, </span><span class="wj">Whom seek ye?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-781'>[5] <span>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, </span><span class="wj">I am </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">.</span><span> And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-782'>[6] <span>As soon then as he had said unto them, </span><span class="wj">I am </span><i class="wj">he</i><span>, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-783'>[7] <span>Then asked he them again, </span><span class="wj">Whom seek ye?</span><span> And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-784'>[8] <span>Jesus answered, </span><span class="wj">I have told you that I am </span><i class="wj">he</i><span class="wj">: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-785'>[9] <span>That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, </span><span class="wj">Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-786'>[10] <span>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-787'>[11] <span>Then said Jesus unto Peter, </span><span class="wj">Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-788'>[12] <span>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-789'>[13] <span>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-790'>[14] <span>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-791'>[15] <span>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and </span><i>so did</i><span> another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-792'>[16] <span>But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-793'>[17] <span>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also </span><i>one</i><span> of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-794'>[18] <span>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-795'>[19] <span>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-796'>[20] <span>Jesus answered him, </span><span class="wj">I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-797'>[21] <span class="wj">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-798'>[22] <span>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-799'>[23] <span>Jesus answered him, </span><span class="wj">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-800'>[24] <span>Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-801'>[25] <span>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also </span><i>one</i><span> of his disciples? He denied </span><i>it</i><span>, and said, I am not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-802'>[26] <span>One of the servants of the high priest, being </span><i>his</i><span> kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-803'>[27] <span>Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-804'>[28] <span>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-805'>[29] <span>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-806'>[30] <span>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-807'>[31] <span>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-808'>[32] <span>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-809'>[33] <span>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-810'>[34] <span>Jesus answered him, </span><span class="wj">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-811'>[35] <span>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-812'>[36] <span>Jesus answered, </span><span class="wj">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-813'>[37] <span>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, </span><span class="wj">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-814'>[38] <span>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault </span><i>at all</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-815'>[39] <span>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-816'>[40] <span>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-818'>Chapter 19</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-819'>[1] <span>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'>[2] <span>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'>[3] <span>and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'>[4] <span>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-823'>[5] <span>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-824'>[6] <span>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-825'>[7] <span>The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'>[8] <span>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'>[9] <span>and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'>[10] <span>"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'>[11] <span>Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'>[12] <span>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'>[13] <span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'>[14] <span>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'>[15] <span>But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'>[16] <span>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'>[17] <span>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'>[18] <span>Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'>[19] <span>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'>[20] <span>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'>[21] <span>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write `The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'>[22] <span>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'>[23] <span>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'>[24] <span>"Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> So this is what the soldiers did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'>[25] <span>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'>[26] <span>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'>[27] <span>and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'>[28] <span>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'>[29] <span>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'>[30] <span>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'>[31] <span>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'>[32] <span>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'>[33] <span>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'>[34] <span>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'>[35] <span>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'>[36] <span>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-855'>[37] <span>and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-3" id="niv-verse-19-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-856'>[38] <span>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857'>[39] <span>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-4" id="niv-verse-19-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858'>[40] <span>Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-859'>[41] <span>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-860'>[42] <span>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-827'>[9] <span>And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-828'>[10] <span>Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-830'>[12] <span>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-831'>[13] <span>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-834'>[16] <span>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led </span><i>him</i><span> away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-835'>[17] <span>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called </span><i>the place</i><span> of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-838'>[20] <span>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, </span><i>and</i><span> Greek, </span><i>and</i><span> Latin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-839'>[21] <span>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-840'>[22] <span>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-841'>[23] <span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also </span><i>his</i><span> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-848'>[30] <span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, </span><span class="wj">It is finished:</span><span> and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-849'>[31] <span>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and </span><i>that</i><span> they might be taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-850'>[32] <span>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863'>[1] <span>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864'>[2] <span>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-865'>[3] <span>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866'>[4] <span>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867'>[5] <span>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-868'>[6] <span>Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-869'>[7] <span>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-870'>[8] <span>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-871'>[9] <span>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-872'>[10] <span>Then the disciples went back to their homes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-873'>[11] <span>but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-874'>[12] <span>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-875'>[13] <span>They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-876'>[14] <span>At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-877'>[15] <span>"Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-878'>[16] <span>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-879'>[17] <span>Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, `I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-880'>[18] <span>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-881'>[19] <span>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-882'>[20] <span>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883'>[21] <span>Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-884'>[22] <span>And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-885'>[23] <span>If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-886'>[24] <span>Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-887'>[25] <span>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888'>[26] <span>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-889'>[27] <span>Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-890'>[28] <span>Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-891'>[29] <span>Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-892'>[30] <span>Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-893'>[31] <span>But these are written that you may </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">a</a>]</sup><span> believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-870'>[8] <span>Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-872'>[10] <span>Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-873'>[11] <span>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, </span><i>and looked</i><span> into the sepulchre,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-875'>[13] <span>And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-876'>[14] <span>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-877'>[15] <span>Jesus saith unto her, </span><span class="wj">Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?</span><span> She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-880'>[18] <span>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and </span><i>that</i><span> he had spoken these things unto her.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-882'>[20] <span>And when he had so said, he shewed unto them </span><i>his</i><span> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-883'>[21] <span>Then said Jesus to them again, </span><span class="wj">Peace </span><i class="wj">be</i><span class="wj"> unto you: as </span><i class="wj">my</i><span class="wj"> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-888'>[26] <span>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: </span><i>then</i><span> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, </span><span class="wj">Peace </span><i class="wj">be</i><span class="wj"> unto you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-896'>[1] <span>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> It happened this way:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-897'>[2] <span>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-898'>[3] <span>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-899'>[4] <span>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-900'>[5] <span>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-901'>[6] <span>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-902'>[7] <span>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-903'>[8] <span>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-904'>[9] <span>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-905'>[10] <span>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-906'>[11] <span>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-907'>[12] <span>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-908'>[13] <span>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909'>[14] <span>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-910'>[15] <span>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-911'>[16] <span>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912'>[17] <span>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-913'>[18] <span>I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-914'>[19] <span>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-915'>[20] <span>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-916'>[21] <span>When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-917'>[22] <span>Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-918'>[23] <span>Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-919'>[24] <span>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'>[25] <span>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </span></div>

And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, </span><span class="wj">Feed my sheep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-913'>[18] <span class="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry </span><i class="wj">thee</i><span class="wj"> whither thou wouldest not.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-915'>[20] <span>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-916'>[21] <span>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what </span><i>shall</i><span> this man </span><i>do</i><span>?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-919'>[24] <span>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-920'>[25] <span>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</span></div>
