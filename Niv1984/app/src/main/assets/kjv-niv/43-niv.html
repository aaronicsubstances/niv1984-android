<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-7" id="niv-verse-1-7">g</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, `Make straight the way for the Lord.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-8" id="niv-verse-1-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now some Pharisees who had been sent</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>"I baptize with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-9" id="niv-verse-1-9">i</a>]</sup><span> water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>This is the one I meant when I said, `A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, `The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-10" id="niv-verse-1-10">j</a>]</sup><span> ).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Jesus said, "You believe </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-11" id="niv-verse-1-11">k</a>]</sup><span> because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He then added, "I tell you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-12" id="niv-verse-1-12">l</a>]</sup><span> the truth, you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-13" id="niv-verse-1-13">m</a>]</sup><span> shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-54'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>"Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-121'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-122'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-123'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Now he had to go through Samaria.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-124'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-125'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Do you not say, `Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Thus the saying `One sows and another reaps' is true.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And because of his words many more became believers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>After the two days he left for Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-173'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, `Pick up your mat and walk.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-224'>Chapter 6</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-225'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-226'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-227'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-228'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>The Jewish Passover Feast was near.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-229'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-230'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-231'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-232'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-233'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-234'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-235'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-236'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-237'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-238'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-239'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-240'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-241'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-242'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-255'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-3" id="niv-verse-6-3">c</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-256'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-257'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-262'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-263'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-264'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-265'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-266'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, `I came down from heaven'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-267'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>It is written in the Prophets: `They will all be taught by God.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-4" id="niv-verse-6-4">d</a>]</sup><span> Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>I am the bread of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-276'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'><span class='verse-num'>[58]</span> <span>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283'><span class='verse-num'>[59]</span> <span>He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'><span class='verse-num'>[60]</span> <span>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'><span class='verse-num'>[61]</span> <span>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'><span class='verse-num'>[62]</span> <span>What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'><span class='verse-num'>[63]</span> <span>The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-5" id="niv-verse-6-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and they are life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'><span class='verse-num'>[64]</span> <span>Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'><span class='verse-num'>[65]</span> <span>He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'><span class='verse-num'>[66]</span> <span>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'><span class='verse-num'>[67]</span> <span>"You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'><span class='verse-num'>[68]</span> <span>Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294'><span class='verse-num'>[70]</span> <span>Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'><span class='verse-num'>[71]</span> <span>(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-297'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-298'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-299'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-300'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>You go to the Feast. I am not yet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-310'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-314'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-317'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>"You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-327'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-328'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-329'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-331'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-332'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-333'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>What did he mean when he said, `You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and `Where I am, you cannot come'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-334'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-335'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Whoever believes in me, as </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-336'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-337'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-338'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-339'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-4" id="niv-verse-7-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-340'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, `Where I go, you cannot come'?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-377'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>"Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-383'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>"I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-475'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>At these words the Jews were again divided.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-501'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-502'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-503'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-504'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-505'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-506'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-507'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-508'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-509'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-510'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-511'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-512'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-513'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-514'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-515'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-516'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-517'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-519'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-520'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-521'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-523'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-524'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-525'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-526'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-527'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>"Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-528'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-529'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-530'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-531'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-532'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-533'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-534'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-535'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Jesus wept.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-536'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-537'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-538'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-539'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>"Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-540'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-541'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-542'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-543'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-544'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-545'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-546'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-547'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-548'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and our nation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-549'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-550'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-551'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-552'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-553'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-554'><span class='verse-num'>[54]</span> <span>Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-555'><span class='verse-num'>[55]</span> <span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-556'><span class='verse-num'>[56]</span> <span>They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-557'><span class='verse-num'>[57]</span> <span>But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-560'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-561'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-562'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Then Mary took about a pint </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-565'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-577'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-579'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-580'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-582'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-583'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-584'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-587'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-588'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-589'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-590'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-592'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-6" id="niv-verse-12-6">f</a>]</sup><span> will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-594'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-595'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-596'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-597'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-7" id="niv-verse-12-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-598'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-599'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-8" id="niv-verse-12-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-600'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-601'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-602'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-618'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>"No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>"Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>"You call me `Teacher' and `Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-804'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-805'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-806'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>"If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-807'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-808'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-809'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-810'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>"Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-811'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>"Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-812'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-813'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>"You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-814'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>"What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-815'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release `the king of the Jews'?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-816'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-819'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-820'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-821'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-822'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-823'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-824'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-825'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-826'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-827'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>"Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-829'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-833'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-834'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-836'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-837'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-838'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-839'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write `The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-840'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-841'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-842'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>"Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">a</a>]</sup><span> So this is what the soldiers did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-843'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-844'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-845'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-846'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-847'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-848'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-849'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-850'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-851'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-852'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-853'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-854'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-2" id="niv-verse-19-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-856'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-857'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-858'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-863'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-864'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-865'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-868'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-869'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-870'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-871'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-872'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Then the disciples went back to their homes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-873'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-874'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-875'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-876'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-877'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>"Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-878'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-879'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, `I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-880'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-881'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-882'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-883'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-884'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-885'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-886'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-887'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-888'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-889'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-892'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-896'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">a</a>]</sup><span> It happened this way:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-897'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-898'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>"I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-899'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-900'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-901'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-902'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-903'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-2" id="niv-verse-21-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-904'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-905'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-906'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-908'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-909'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-911'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-912'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-915'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-920'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </span></div>
