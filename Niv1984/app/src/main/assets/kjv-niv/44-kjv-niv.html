<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And, being assembled together with </span><i>them</i><span>, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, </span><span class="wj">but wait for the promise of the Father, which,</span> <i>saith he</i><span>, </span><span class="wj">ye have heard of me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For John baptized with </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span class="wj">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>He said to them: "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span class="wj">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>"Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> from the city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James </span><i>the son</i><span> of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas </span><i>the brother</i><span> of James.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>In those days Peter stood up among the believers </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>and said, "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>he was one of our number and shared in this ministry."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>(With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>"For," said Peter, "it is written in the book of Psalms, "`May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup><span> and, "`May another take his place of leadership.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">5</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all </span><i>men</i><span>, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer--at three in the afternoon.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, </span><i>being</i><span> the ninth </span><i>hour</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted </span><i>him</i><span> up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And they laid hands on them, and put </span><i>them</i><span> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: "By what power or what name did you do this?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: "Rulers and elders of the people!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, </span><i>even</i><span> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>He is "`the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>"What are we going to do with these men?" they asked. "Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them </span><i>is</i><span> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all </span><i>men</i><span> glorified God for that which was done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">1</a>]</sup><span> spirits, and all of them were healed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>There came also a multitude </span><i>out</i><span> of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>"Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people the full message of this new life."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And when they heard </span><i>that</i><span>, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>"We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And when they had brought them, they set </span><i>them</i><span> before the council: and the high priest asked them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Peter and the other apostles replied: "We must obey God rather than men!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Then Peter and the </span><i>other</i><span> apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead--whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Him hath God exalted with his right hand </span><i>to be</i><span> a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And we are his witnesses of these things; and </span><i>so is</i><span> also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>When they heard </span><i>that</i><span>, they were cut </span><i>to the heart</i><span>, and took counsel to slay them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>Then he addressed them: "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, </span><i>even</i><span> as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten </span><i>them</i><span>, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)--Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed </span><i>them</i><span> to prison.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">1</a>]</sup><span> there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And there was great joy in that city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">3</a>]</sup><span> the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then laid they </span><i>their</i><span> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and </span><i>in</i><span> the bond of iniquity.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-4" id="niv-verse-8-4">4</a>]</sup><span> eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And Philip ran thither to </span><i>him</i><span>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>"How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-5" id="niv-verse-8-5">5</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-6" id="niv-verse-8-6">6</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>And as they went on </span><i>their</i><span> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, </span><i>here is</i><span> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, </span><span class="wj">Ananias.</span><span> And he said, Behold, I </span><i>am here</i><span>, Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>"Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But the Lord said unto him, </span><span class="wj">Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span class="wj">For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then Ananias went to the house and entered it.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, </span><i>even</i><span> Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">1</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Then the disciples took him by night, and let </span><i>him</i><span> down by the wall in a basket.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>But Barnabas took him, and brought </span><i>him</i><span> to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <i>Which</i><span> when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ), who was always doing good and helping the poor.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid </span><i>her</i><span> in an upper chamber.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, "Please come at once!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning </span><i>him</i><span> to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian </span><i>band</i><span>,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <i>A</i><span> devout </span><i>man</i><span>, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And now send men to Joppa, and call for </span><i>one</i><span> Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And when he had declared all </span><i>these</i><span> things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>"Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And the voice </span><i>spake</i><span> unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, </span><i>that</i><span> call not thou common.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">1</a>]</sup><span> men are looking for you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what </span><i>is</i><span> the cause wherefore ye are come?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>The men replied, "We have come from Cornelius the centurion.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Then called he them in, and lodged </span><i>them</i><span>. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Therefore came I </span><i>unto you</i><span> without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Cornelius answered: "Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth </span><i>his</i><span> hands to vex certain of the church.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And when he had apprehended him, he put </span><i>him</i><span> in prison, and delivered </span><i>him</i><span> to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon </span><i>him</i><span>, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and </span><i>from</i><span> all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And when he had considered </span><i>the thing</i><span>, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"You're out of your mind," they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "It must be his angel."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened </span><i>the door</i><span>, and saw him, they were astonished.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use </span><i>them</i><span> despitefully, and to stone them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>They were ware of </span><i>it</i><span>, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>where they continued to preach the good news.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And there they preached the gospel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>and called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <i>Which</i><span> when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard </span><i>of</i><span>, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>In the past, he let all nations go their own way.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And there came thither </span><i>certain</i><span> Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew </span><i>him</i><span> out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and </span><i>to</i><span> Iconium, and Antioch,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Confirming the souls of the disciples, </span><i>and</i><span> exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: "Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, </span><i>and said</i><span>, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and </span><i>of</i><span> the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command </span><i>them</i><span> to keep the law of Moses.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>The apostles and elders met to consider this question.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as </span><i>he did</i><span> unto us;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>When they finished, James spoke up: "Brothers, listen to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, hearken unto me:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Simon </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">1</a>]</sup><span> has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>"`After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-2" id="niv-verse-15-2">2</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and </span><i>from</i><span> fornication, and </span><i>from</i><span> things strangled, and </span><i>from</i><span> blood.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; </span><i>namely</i><span>, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And they wrote </span><i>letters</i><span> by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren </span><i>send</i><span> greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, </span><i>Ye must</i><span> be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no </span><i>such</i><span> commandment:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell </span><i>you</i><span> the same things by mouth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-4" id="niv-verse-15-4">4</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And after they had tarried </span><i>there</i><span> a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, </span><i>and see</i><span> how they do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father </span><i>was</i><span> a Greek:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next </span><i>day</i><span> to Neapolis;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, </span><i>and</i><span> a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted </span><i>thither</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard </span><i>us</i><span>: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought </span><i>us</i><span>, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide </span><i>there</i><span>. And she constrained us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew </span><i>them</i><span> into the marketplace unto the rulers,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast </span><i>them</i><span> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed </span><i>their</i><span> stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>But Paul said to the officers: "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast </span><i>us</i><span> into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And they came and besought them, and brought </span><i>them</i><span> out, and desired </span><i>them</i><span> to depart out of the city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And they went out of the prison, and entered into </span><i>the house of</i><span> Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>explaining and proving that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-1" id="niv-verse-17-1">1</a>]</sup><span> had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-2" id="niv-verse-17-2">2</a>]</sup><span> " he said.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-17-3" id="niv-verse-17-3">3</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, </span><i>one</i><span> Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming </span><i>thither</i><span> went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, </span><i>is</i><span>?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, </span><i>Ye</i><span> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>`For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, `We are his offspring.'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by </span><i>that</i><span> man whom he hath ordained; </span><i>whereof</i><span> he hath given assurance unto all </span><i>men</i><span>, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this </span><i>matter</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>At that, Paul left the Council.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>So Paul departed from among them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">1</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews </span><i>that</i><span> Jesus </span><i>was</i><span> Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook </span><i>his</i><span> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood </span><i>be</i><span> upon your own heads; I </span><i>am</i><span> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain </span><i>man's</i><span> house, named Justus, </span><i>one</i><span> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, </span><span class="wj">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span class="wj">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And he continued </span><i>there</i><span> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>"This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Saying, This </span><i>fellow</i><span> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when Paul was now about to open </span><i>his</i><span> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O </span><i>ye</i><span> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law--settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But if it be a question of words and names, and </span><i>of</i><span> your law, look ye </span><i>to it</i><span>; for I will be no judge of such </span><i>matters</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>So he had them ejected from the court.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And he drave them from the judgment seat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat </span><i>him</i><span> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And Paul </span><i>after this</i><span> tarried </span><i>there</i><span> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn </span><i>his</i><span> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>When they desired </span><i>him</i><span> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And after he had spent some time </span><i>there</i><span>, he departed, and went over </span><i>all</i><span> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, </span><i>and</i><span> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-2" id="niv-verse-18-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto </span><i>them</i><span>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-1" id="niv-verse-19-1">1</a>]</sup><span> you believed?"

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" "John's baptism," they replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-19-4" id="niv-verse-19-4">4</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all </span><i>men</i><span>: and they counted the price of them, and found </span><i>it</i><span> fifty thousand </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>For a certain </span><i>man</i><span> named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: "Men, you know we receive a good income from this business.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And when they heard </span><i>these sayings</i><span>, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great </span><i>is</i><span> Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring </span><i>him</i><span> that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great </span><i>is</i><span> Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: "Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, </span><i>Ye</i><span> men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the </span><i>image</i><span> which fell down from Jupiter?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said good-by and set out for Macedonia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto </span><i>him</i><span> the disciples, and embraced </span><i>them</i><span>, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And </span><i>there</i><span> abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>These going before tarried for us at Troas.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And upon the first </span><i>day</i><span> of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing </span><i>him</i><span> said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Kios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And we sailed thence, and came the next </span><i>day</i><span> over against Chios; and the next </span><i>day</i><span> we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next </span><i>day</i><span> we came to Miletus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>When they arrived, he said to them: "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <i>And</i><span> how I kept back nothing that was profitable </span><i>unto you</i><span>, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>"And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me--the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>"Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I </span><i>am</i><span> pure from the blood of all </span><i>men</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-1" id="niv-verse-20-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Be shepherds of the church of God, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-20-2" id="niv-verse-20-2">2</a>]</sup><span> which he bought with his own blood.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>"Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: `It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, </span><span class="wj">It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>When he had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the </span><i>day</i><span> following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But when our time was up, we left and continued on our way. All the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till </span><i>we were</i><span> out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>After saying good-by to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when we had finished </span><i>our</i><span> course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And the next </span><i>day</i><span> we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was </span><i>one</i><span> of the seven; and abode with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And as we tarried </span><i>there</i><span> many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, "The Holy Spirit says, `In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver </span><i>him</i><span> into the hands of the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>After this, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>There went with us also </span><i>certain</i><span> of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us warmly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And the </span><i>day</i><span> following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And when they heard </span><i>it</i><span>, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise </span><i>their</i><span> children, neither to walk after the customs.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave </span><i>their</i><span> heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but </span><i>that</i><span> thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written </span><i>and</i><span> concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from </span><i>things</i><span> offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>shouting, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all </span><i>men</i><span> every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple area.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded </span><i>him</i><span> to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>The crowd that followed kept shouting, "Away with him!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" "Do you speak Greek?" he replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>"Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert some time ago?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>But Paul said, I am a man </span><i>which am</i><span> a Jew of Tarsus, </span><i>a city</i><span> in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>Having received the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-1" id="niv-verse-21-1">1</a>]</sup><span> :</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto </span><i>them</i><span> in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, `Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, </span><span class="wj">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>"`Who are you, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,' he replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>"`What shall I do, Lord?' I asked. "`Get up,' the Lord said, `and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And he said unto me, </span><span class="wj">Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And they gave him audience unto this word, and </span><i>then</i><span> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a </span><i>fellow</i><span> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And as they cried out, and cast off </span><i>their</i><span> clothes, and threw dust into the air,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>When the centurion heard </span><i>that</i><span>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Then the commander said, "I had to pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was </span><i>free</i><span> born.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from </span><i>his</i><span> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, </span><i>thou</i><span> whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Those who were standing near Paul said, "You dare to insult God's high priest?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: `Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-1" id="niv-verse-23-1">1</a>]</sup><span> "</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And there arose a great cry: and the scribes </span><i>that were</i><span> of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring </span><i>him</i><span> into the castle.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>More than forty men were involved in this plot.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Then Paul called one of the centurions unto </span><i>him</i><span>, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>So he took him, and brought </span><i>him</i><span> to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto </span><i>him</i><span>, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went </span><i>with him</i><span> aside privately, and asked </span><i>him</i><span>, What is that thou hast to tell me?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>He said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>So the chief captain </span><i>then</i><span> let the young man depart, and charged </span><i>him, See thou</i><span> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-23-2" id="niv-verse-23-2">2</a>]</sup><span> to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And he called unto </span><i>him</i><span> two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And provide </span><i>them</i><span> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring </span><i>him</i><span> safe unto Felix the governor.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>He wrote a letter as follows: </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And he wrote a letter after this manner:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix </span><i>sendeth</i><span> greeting.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what </span><i>they had</i><span> against him. Farewell.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought </span><i>him</i><span> by night to Antipatris.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>And when the governor had read </span><i>the letter</i><span>, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that </span><i>he was</i><span> of Cilicia;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers get here." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and </span><i>with</i><span> a certain orator </span><i>named</i><span> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse </span><i>him</i><span>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>We accept </span><i>it</i><span> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>"We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For we have found this man </span><i>a</i><span> pestilent </span><i>fellow</i><span>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But the chief captain Lysias came </span><i>upon us</i><span>, and with great violence took </span><i>him</i><span> away out of our hands,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>By </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-24-1" id="niv-verse-24-1">1</a>]</sup><span> examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and </span><i>toward</i><span> men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>"After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Or else let these same </span><i>here</i><span> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: `It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of </span><i>that</i><span> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let </span><i>him</i><span> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>They urgently requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Festus answered, "Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly </span><i>thither</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there, if he has done anything wrong."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with </span><i>me</i><span>, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>After spending eight or ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Then Paul made his defense: "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Paul answered: "I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. He said: "There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed </span><i>me</i><span>, desiring </span><i>to have</i><span> judgment against him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>"I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked </span><i>him</i><span> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>When Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." He replied, "Tomorrow you will hear him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Festus said: "King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and </span><i>also</i><span> here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For I think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes </span><i>laid</i><span> against him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>"King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Especially </span><i>because I know</i><span> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>"The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Unto which </span><i>promise</i><span> our twelve tribes, instantly serving </span><i>God</i><span> day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>"I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled </span><i>them</i><span> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted </span><i>them</i><span> even unto strange cities.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>"On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-1" id="niv-verse-26-1">1</a>]</sup><span> `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, </span><span class="wj">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? </span><i class="wj">it is</i><span class="wj"> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"Then I asked, `Who are you, Lord?' "`I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, </span><span class="wj">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>`Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span class="wj">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span class="wj">Delivering thee from the people, and </span><i class="wj">from</i><span class="wj"> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span class="wj">To open their eyes, </span><i class="wj">and</i><span class="wj"> to turn </span><i class="wj">them</i><span class="wj"> from darkness to light, and </span><i class="wj">from</i><span class="wj"> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>"So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and </span><i>then</i><span> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill </span><i>me</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>that the Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-26-2" id="niv-verse-26-2">2</a>]</sup><span> would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>That Christ should suffer, </span><i>and</i><span> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. "You are out of your mind, Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning is driving you insane."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>"I am not insane, most excellent Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying is true and reasonable.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?"</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Paul replied, "Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto </span><i>one</i><span> named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; </span><i>one</i><span> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>And the next </span><i>day</i><span> we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave </span><i>him</i><span> liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, </span><i>a city</i><span> of Lycia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city </span><i>of</i><span> Lasea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-1" id="niv-verse-27-1">1</a>]</sup><span> So Paul warned them,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished </span><i>them</i><span>,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>"Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, </span><i>and there</i><span> to winter; </span><i>which is</i><span> an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained </span><i>their</i><span> purpose, loosing </span><i>thence</i><span>, they sailed close by Crete.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the "northeaster," swept down from the island.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let </span><i>her</i><span> drive.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next </span><i>day</i><span> they lightened the ship;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And the third </span><i>day</i><span> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on </span><i>us</i><span>, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of </span><i>any man's</i><span> life among you, but of the ship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>and said, `Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-2" id="niv-verse-27-2">2</a>]</sup><span> Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-3" id="niv-verse-27-3">3</a>]</sup><span> deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-27-4" id="niv-verse-27-4">4</a>]</sup><span> deep.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And sounded, and found </span><i>it</i><span> twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found </span><i>it</i><span> fifteen fathoms.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[33] <span>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought </span><i>them</i><span> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[34] <span>Wherefore I pray you to take </span><i>some</i><span> meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[35] <span>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken </span><i>it</i><span>, he began to eat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[36] <span>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took </span><i>some</i><span> meat.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>Altogether there were 276 of us on board.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[37] <span>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[38] <span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[39] <span>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[40] <span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed </span><i>themselves</i><span> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[41] <span>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[42] <span>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[43] <span>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from </span><i>their</i><span> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast </span><i>themselves</i><span> first </span><i>into the sea</i><span>, and get to land:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[44] <span>And the rest, some on boards, and some on </span><i>broken pieces</i><span> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>They honored us in many ways and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded </span><i>us</i><span> with such things as were necessary.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried </span><i>there</i><span> three days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>There we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: "My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let </span><i>me</i><span> go, because there was no cause of death in me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--not that I had any charge to bring against my own people.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But when the Jews spake against </span><i>it</i><span>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see </span><i>you</i><span>, and to speak with </span><i>you</i><span>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>They replied, "We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into </span><i>his</i><span> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and </span><i>out of</i><span> the prophets, from morning till evening.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>"`Go to this people and say, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with </span><i>their</i><span> eyes, and hear with </span><i>their</i><span> ears, and understand with </span><i>their</i><span> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>"Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-28-2" id="niv-verse-28-2">2</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and </span><i>that</i><span> they will hear it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</span></div></div>
