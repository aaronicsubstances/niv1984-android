<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And, being assembled together with </span><i>them</i><span>, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, </span><span class="wj">but wait for the promise of the Father, which,</span> <i>saith he</i><span>, </span><span class="wj">ye have heard of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span class="wj">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he said unto them, </span><span class="wj">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span class="wj">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James </span><i>the son</i><span> of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas </span><i>the brother</i><span> of James.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all </span><i>men</i><span>, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-29'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all </span><i>ye</i><span> that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is </span><i>but</i><span> the third hour of the day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And it shall come to pass, </span><i>that</i><span> whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>Now when they heard </span><i>this</i><span>, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men </span><i>and</i><span> brethren, what shall we do?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, </span><i>even</i><span> as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added </span><i>unto them</i><span> about three thousand souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all </span><i>men</i><span>, as every man had need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-78'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, </span><i>being</i><span> the ninth </span><i>hour</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-82'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-85'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted </span><i>him</i><span> up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-86'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-88'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-89'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-90'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when Peter saw </span><i>it</i><span>, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-91'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let </span><i>him</i><span> go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-92'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-93'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-94'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-273'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-274'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-280'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-305'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-306'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian </span><i>band</i><span>,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <i>A</i><span> devout </span><i>man</i><span>, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And now send men to Joppa, and call for </span><i>one</i><span> Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And when he had declared all </span><i>these</i><span> things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the voice </span><i>spake</i><span> unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, </span><i>that</i><span> call not thou common.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-375'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-376'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what </span><i>is</i><span> the cause wherefore ye are come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-377'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-378'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Then called he them in, and lodged </span><i>them</i><span>. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-379'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-380'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped </span><i>him</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-381'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-382'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-383'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-384'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Therefore came I </span><i>unto you</i><span> without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-387'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of </span><i>one</i><span> Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-388'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-389'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Then Peter opened </span><i>his</i><span> mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-390'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-391'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>The word which </span><i>God</i><span> sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-393'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-394'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-395'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-396'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, </span><i>even</i><span> to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-397'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God </span><i>to be</i><span> the Judge of quick and dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-400'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-409'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But Peter rehearsed </span><i>the matter</i><span> from the beginning, and expounded </span><i>it</i><span> by order unto them, saying,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-410'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-411'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-412'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, </span><i>that</i><span> call not thou common.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, </span><span class="wj">John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as </span><i>he did</i><span> unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-432'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-440'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-441'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when he had apprehended him, he put </span><i>him</i><span> in prison, and delivered </span><i>him</i><span> to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-442'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-445'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-448'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and </span><i>from</i><span> all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-449'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And when he had considered </span><i>the thing</i><span>, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-458'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-593'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-594'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-595'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-596'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-597'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-598'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-599'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-600'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-601'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-602'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next </span><i>day</i><span> to Neapolis;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-603'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, </span><i>and</i><span> a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-604'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted </span><i>thither</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-605'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard </span><i>us</i><span>: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-606'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought </span><i>us</i><span>, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide </span><i>there</i><span>. And she constrained us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-607'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-608'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-609'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-610'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew </span><i>them</i><span> into the marketplace unto the rulers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-611'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-612'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-613'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-614'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast </span><i>them</i><span> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-615'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-616'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-617'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-618'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-619'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-620'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-621'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-622'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-623'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-624'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed </span><i>their</i><span> stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-625'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-626'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-629'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-630'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And they came and besought them, and brought </span><i>them</i><span> out, and desired </span><i>them</i><span> to depart out of the city.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-634'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-635'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-636'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-637'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-638'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-639'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-640'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, </span><i>one</i><span> Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-641'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-642'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-643'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming </span><i>thither</i><span> went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-644'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-645'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-646'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-647'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-648'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-649'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-650'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-651'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-652'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, </span><i>is</i><span>?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-653'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-654'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-655'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, </span><i>Ye</i><span> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-656'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-657'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-661'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-662'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-663'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-664'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by </span><i>that</i><span> man whom he hath ordained; </span><i>whereof</i><span> he hath given assurance unto all </span><i>men</i><span>, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-665'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this </span><i>matter</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-666'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>So Paul departed from among them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-676'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain </span><i>man's</i><span> house, named Justus, </span><i>one</i><span> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-677'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-709'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-710'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-711'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-712'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-713'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And there were seven sons of </span><i>one</i><span> Sceva, a Jew, </span><i>and</i><span> chief of the priests, which did so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-714'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-715'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-716'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-717'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-718'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all </span><i>men</i><span>: and they counted the price of them, and found </span><i>it</i><span> fifty thousand </span><i>pieces</i><span> of silver.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-719'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-720'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-721'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-722'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-723'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For a certain </span><i>man</i><span> named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-724'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-725'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-726'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-727'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And when they heard </span><i>these sayings</i><span>, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great </span><i>is</i><span> Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-728'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-729'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-730'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring </span><i>him</i><span> that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-731'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-732'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-733'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great </span><i>is</i><span> Diana of the Ephesians.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-734'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, </span><i>Ye</i><span> men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the </span><i>image</i><span> which fell down from Jupiter?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-735'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-736'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-737'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-738'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-739'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-740'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-751'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-753'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-754'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-755'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-758'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-759'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-828'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-830'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-831'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, </span><span class="wj">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-832'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, </span><span class="wj">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-835'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-863'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-866'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring </span><i>him</i><span> into the castle.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-867'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, </span><span class="wj">Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-877'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-878'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>So the chief captain </span><i>then</i><span> let the young man depart, and charged </span><i>him, See thou</i><span> tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-887'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought </span><i>him</i><span> by night to Antipatris.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-888'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-936'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-937'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed </span><i>me</i><span>, desiring </span><i>to have</i><span> judgment against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-938'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-939'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-940'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-941'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-942'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked </span><i>him</i><span> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-943'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-944'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-945'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-946'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and </span><i>also</i><span> here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-947'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-959'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-960'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-961'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against </span><i>them</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-962'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled </span><i>them</i><span> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted </span><i>them</i><span> even unto strange cities.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-963'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-964'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-965'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, </span><span class="wj">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? </span><i class="wj">it is</i><span class="wj"> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-966'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, </span><span class="wj">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-972'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill </span><i>me</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-973'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-975'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-976'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-986'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto </span><i>one</i><span> named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-987'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; </span><i>one</i><span> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-988'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And the next </span><i>day</i><span> we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave </span><i>him</i><span> liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-989'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-990'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, </span><i>a city</i><span> of Lycia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-991'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-992'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-993'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city </span><i>of</i><span> Lasea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-994'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished </span><i>them</i><span>,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-995'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-996'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-997'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, </span><i>and there</i><span> to winter; </span><i>which is</i><span> an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-998'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained </span><i>their</i><span> purpose, loosing </span><i>thence</i><span>, they sailed close by Crete.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-999'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1000'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let </span><i>her</i><span> drive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1001'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1002'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1003'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next </span><i>day</i><span> they lightened the ship;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1014'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1015'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1016'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1017'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1018'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought </span><i>them</i><span> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1020'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken </span><i>it</i><span>, he began to eat.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1023'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1024'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1025'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed </span><i>themselves</i><span> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1026'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1027'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1028'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from </span><i>their</i><span> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast </span><i>themselves</i><span> first </span><i>into the sea</i><span>, and get to land:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-1029'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>And the rest, some on boards, and some on </span><i>broken pieces</i><span> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</span></div>
