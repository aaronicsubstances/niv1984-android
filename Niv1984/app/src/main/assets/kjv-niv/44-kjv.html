<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</i>
