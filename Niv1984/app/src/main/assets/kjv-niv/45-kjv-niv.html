<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed </span><i>it</i><span> unto them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, </span><i>even</i><span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified </span><i>him</i><span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>And even as they did not like to retain God in </span><i>their</i><span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath </span><i>whereof</i><span> to glory; but not before God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <i>Cometh</i><span> this blessedness then upon the circumcision </span><i>only</i><span>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which </span><i>he had yet</i><span> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which </span><i>he had</i><span> being </span><i>yet</i><span> uncircumcised.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, </span><i>was</i><span> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>For if they which are of the law </span><i>be</i><span> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, </span><i>there is</i><span> no transgression.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Therefore </span><i>it is</i><span> of faith, that </span><i>it might be</i><span> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, </span><i>even</i><span> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-4" id="niv-verse-4-4">4</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>And not only </span><i>so</i><span>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But not as the offence, so also </span><i>is</i><span> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, </span><i>which is</i><span> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And not as </span><i>it was</i><span> by one that sinned, </span><i>so is</i><span> the gift: for the judgment </span><i>was</i><span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift </span><i>is</i><span> of many offences unto justification.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Therefore as by the offence of one </span><i>judgment came</i><span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one </span><i>the free gift came</i><span> upon all men unto justification of life.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to </span><i>her</i><span> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of </span><i>her</i><span> husband.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So then if, while </span><i>her</i><span> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, </span><i>even</i><span> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not </span><i>in</i><span> the oldness of the letter.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law.

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>What shall we say then? </span><i>Is</i><span> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin </span><i>was</i><span> dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>And the commandment, which </span><i>was ordained</i><span> to life, I found </span><i>to be</i><span> unto death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew </span><i>me</i><span>.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that </span><i>it is</i><span> good.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">3</a>]</sup><span> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but </span><i>how</i><span> to perform that which is good I find not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in </span><i>your</i><span> prayers to God for me;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which </span><i>I have</i><span> for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[32] <span>That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</span></div></div>
