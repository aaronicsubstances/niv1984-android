<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called </span><i>to be</i><span> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And declared </span><i>to be</i><span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called </span><i>to be</i><span> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed </span><i>it</i><span> unto them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, </span><i>even</i><span> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified </span><i>him</i><span> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And even as they did not like to retain God in </span><i>their</i><span> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For there is no respect of persons with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-132'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-133'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-134'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And not only </span><i>so</i><span>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-141'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But not as the offence, so also </span><i>is</i><span> the free gift.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-142'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And not as </span><i>it was</i><span> by one that sinned, </span><i>so is</i><span> the gift: for the judgment </span><i>was</i><span> by one to condemnation, but the free gift </span><i>is</i><span> of many offences unto justification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Therefore as by the offence of one </span><i>judgment came</i><span> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one </span><i>the free gift came</i><span> upon all men unto justification of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-178'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, </span><i>even</i><span> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-179'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</span></div>
