<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>and who through the Spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. </span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[26] <span>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[27] <span>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[28] <span>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[29] <span>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[30] <span>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[31] <span>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[32] <span>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-33'>[1] <span>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[2] <span>Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[3] <span>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[4] <span>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[5] <span>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[6] <span>God "will give to each person according to what he has done." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-39'>[7] <span>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[8] <span>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[9] <span>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[10] <span>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[11] <span>For God does not show favoritism.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[12] <span>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[13] <span>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[14] <span>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[15] <span>since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[16] <span>This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[17] <span>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God;</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[18] <span>if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[19] <span>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,</span></div>

<div id='verse-52'>[20] <span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[21] <span>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[22] <span>You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[23] <span>You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[24] <span>As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-57'>[25] <span>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[26] <span>If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[27] <span>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[28] <span>A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[29] <span>No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-62'>[1] <span>What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[2] <span>Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[3] <span>What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[4] <span>Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-66'>[5] <span>But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[6] <span>Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?</span></div>

<div id='verse-68'>[7] <span>Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[8] <span>Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[9] <span>What shall we conclude then? Are we any better </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> ? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[10] <span>As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one;</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[11] <span>there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[12] <span>All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-74'>[13] <span>"Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-4" id="niv-verse-3-4">d</a>]</sup><span> "The poison of vipers is on their lips." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-5" id="niv-verse-3-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-75'>[14] <span>"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-6" id="niv-verse-3-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-76'>[15] <span>"Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[16] <span>ruin and misery mark their ways,</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[17] <span>and the way of peace they do not know." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-7" id="niv-verse-3-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-79'>[18] <span>"There is no fear of God before their eyes." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-8" id="niv-verse-3-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-80'>[19] <span>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[20] <span>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-82'>[21] <span>But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[22] <span>This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[23] <span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[24] <span>and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[25] <span>God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-9" id="niv-verse-3-9">i</a>]</sup><span> through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[26] <span>he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[27] <span>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[28] <span>For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[29] <span>Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[30] <span>since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[31] <span>Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-93'>[1] <span>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[2] <span>If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[3] <span>What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-96'>[4] <span>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[5] <span>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[6] <span>David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[7] <span>"Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[8] <span>Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-101'>[9] <span>Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-102'>[10] <span>Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[11] <span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[12] <span>And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[13] <span>It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[14] <span>For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[15] <span>because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[16] <span>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[17] <span>As it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup><span> He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed--the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[18] <span>Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-4" id="niv-verse-4-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-111'>[19] <span>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-112'>[20] <span>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-113'>[21] <span>being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</span></div>

<div id='verse-114'>[22] <span>This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."</span></div>

<div id='verse-115'>[23] <span>The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,</span></div>

<div id='verse-116'>[24] <span>but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-117'>[25] <span>He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</span></div>

<div id='verse-127'>[10] <span>For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[11] <span>Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[12] <span>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--</span></div>

<div id='verse-130'>[13] <span>for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-131'>[14] <span>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[15] <span>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</span></div>

<div id='verse-133'>[16] <span>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</span></div>

<div id='verse-134'>[17] <span>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[18] <span>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[19] <span>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[20] <span>The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</span></div>

<div id='verse-138'>[21] <span>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-139'>[1] <span>What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[2] <span>By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[3] <span>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span></div>

<div id='verse-142'>[4] <span>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-143'>[5] <span>If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[6] <span>For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> that we should no longer be slaves to sin--</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[7] <span>because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[8] <span>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[9] <span>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[10] <span>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[11] <span>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[12] <span>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[13] <span>Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[14] <span>For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[15] <span>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[16] <span>Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[17] <span>But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[18] <span>You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[19] <span>I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[20] <span>When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[21] <span>What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[22] <span>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[23] <span>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-162'>[1] <span>Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[2] <span>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[3] <span>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[4] <span>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[5] <span>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[6] <span>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[7] <span>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-169'>[8] <span>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[9] <span>Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-171'>[10] <span>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[11] <span>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[12] <span>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[13] <span>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[14] <span>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[15] <span>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[16] <span>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[17] <span>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-179'>[18] <span>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</span></div>

<div id='verse-180'>[19] <span>For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-181'>[20] <span>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[21] <span>So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[22] <span>For in my inner being I delight in God's law;</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[23] <span>but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[24] <span>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</span></div>

<div id='verse-186'>[25] <span>Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-188'>[2] <span>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-189'>[3] <span>For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup><span> God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-3" id="niv-verse-8-3">c</a>]</sup><span> And so he condemned sin in sinful man, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-4" id="niv-verse-8-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-190'>[4] <span>in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[5] <span>Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[6] <span>The mind of sinful man </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-5" id="niv-verse-8-5">e</a>]</sup><span> is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;</span></div>

<div id='verse-193'>[7] <span>the sinful mind </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-6" id="niv-verse-8-6">f</a>]</sup><span> is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.</span></div>

<div id='verse-194'>[8] <span>Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[9] <span>You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[10] <span>But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-197'>[11] <span>And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-198'>[12] <span>Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-199'>[13] <span>For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live,</span></div>

<div id='verse-200'>[14] <span>because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-201'>[15] <span>For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-7" id="niv-verse-8-7">g</a>]</sup><span> And by him we cry, "Abba, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-8" id="niv-verse-8-8">h</a>]</sup><span> Father."</span></div>

<div id='verse-202'>[16] <span>The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.</span></div>

<div id='verse-203'>[17] <span>Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[18] <span>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[19] <span>The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-206'>[20] <span>For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope</span></div>

<div id='verse-207'>[21] <span>that </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-9" id="niv-verse-8-9">i</a>]</sup><span> the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[22] <span>We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</span></div>

<div id='verse-209'>[23] <span>Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-210'>[24] <span>For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has?</span></div>

<div id='verse-211'>[25] <span>But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.</span></div>

<div id='verse-212'>[26] <span>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</span></div>

<div id='verse-213'>[27] <span>And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will.</span></div>

<div id='verse-214'>[28] <span>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-10" id="niv-verse-8-10">j</a>]</sup><span> who </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-11" id="niv-verse-8-11">k</a>]</sup><span> have been called according to his purpose.</span></div>

<div id='verse-215'>[29] <span>For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-216'>[30] <span>And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-217'>[31] <span>What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span></div>

<div id='verse-218'>[32] <span>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?</span></div>

<div id='verse-219'>[33] <span>Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.</span></div>

<div id='verse-220'>[34] <span>Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-221'>[35] <span>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?</span></div>

<div id='verse-222'>[36] <span>As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-12" id="niv-verse-8-12">l</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-223'>[37] <span>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</span></div>

<div id='verse-227'>[2] <span>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</span></div>

<div id='verse-228'>[3] <span>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</span></div>

<div id='verse-229'>[4] <span>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</span></div>

<div id='verse-231'>[6] <span>It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</span></div>

<div id='verse-241'>[16] <span>It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-259'>[1] <span>Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-260'>[2] <span>For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</span></div>

<div id='verse-261'>[3] <span>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[4] <span>Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-263'>[5] <span>Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: "The man who does these things will live by them." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-264'>[6] <span>But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup><span> " (that is, to bring Christ down)</span></div>

<div id='verse-265'>[7] <span>"or `Who will descend into the deep?' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-3" id="niv-verse-10-3">c</a>]</sup><span> " (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span></div>

<div id='verse-266'>[8] <span>But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-4" id="niv-verse-10-4">d</a>]</sup><span> that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:</span></div>

<div id='verse-267'>[9] <span>That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-268'>[10] <span>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.</span></div>

<div id='verse-269'>[11] <span>As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-270'>[12] <span>For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,</span></div>

<div id='verse-271'>[13] <span>for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-6" id="niv-verse-10-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-272'>[14] <span>How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?</span></div>

<div id='verse-273'>[15] <span>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-7" id="niv-verse-10-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-274'>[16] <span>But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-8" id="niv-verse-10-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-275'>[17] <span>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[18] <span>But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-9" id="niv-verse-10-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-277'>[19] <span>Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-10" id="niv-verse-10-10">j</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-278'>[20] <span>And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-11" id="niv-verse-10-11">k</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-279'>[21] <span>But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-12" id="niv-verse-10-12">l</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-280'>[1] <span>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-281'>[2] <span>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[3] <span>"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[4] <span>And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-284'>[5] <span>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[6] <span>And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-286'>[7] <span>What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[8] <span>as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-4" id="niv-verse-11-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-288'>[9] <span>And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[10] <span>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-5" id="niv-verse-11-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-290'>[11] <span>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[12] <span>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[13] <span>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[14] <span>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[15] <span>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[16] <span>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span></div>

<div id='verse-296'>[17] <span>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[18] <span>do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[19] <span>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[20] <span>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[21] <span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[22] <span>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[23] <span>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-303'>[24] <span>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</span></div>

<div id='verse-304'>[25] <span>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</span></div>

<div id='verse-305'>[26] <span>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</span></div>

<div id='verse-306'>[27] <span>And this is </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-6" id="niv-verse-11-6">f</a>]</sup><span> my covenant with them when I take away their sins." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-7" id="niv-verse-11-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-307'>[28] <span>As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,</span></div>

<div id='verse-308'>[29] <span>for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.</span></div>

<div id='verse-309'>[30] <span>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</span></div>

<div id='verse-310'>[31] <span>so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-8" id="niv-verse-11-8">h</a>]</sup><span> receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-311'>[32] <span>For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</span></div>

<div id='verse-312'>[33] <span>Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-9" id="niv-verse-11-9">i</a>]</sup><span> knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!</span></div>

<div id='verse-313'>[34] <span>"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-10" id="niv-verse-11-10">j</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-314'>[35] <span>"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-11" id="niv-verse-11-11">k</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-337'>[1] <span>Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-338'>[2] <span>Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-339'>[3] <span>For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-340'>[4] <span>For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-341'>[5] <span>Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.</span></div>

<div id='verse-342'>[6] <span>This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-343'>[7] <span>Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-344'>[8] <span>Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-345'>[9] <span>The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: "Love your neighbor as yourself." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-2" id="niv-verse-13-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-346'>[10] <span>Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-347'>[11] <span>And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-348'>[12] <span>The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.</span></div>

<div id='verse-349'>[13] <span>Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.</span></div>

<div id='verse-350'>[14] <span>Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-3" id="niv-verse-13-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-351'>[1] <span>Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-352'>[2] <span>One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.</span></div>

<div id='verse-353'>[3] <span>The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-354'>[4] <span>Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-355'>[5] <span>One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.</span></div>

<div id='verse-356'>[6] <span>He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-357'>[7] <span>For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone.</span></div>

<div id='verse-358'>[8] <span>If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-359'>[9] <span>For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.</span></div>

<div id='verse-360'>[10] <span>You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-361'>[11] <span>It is written: "`As surely as I live,' says the Lord, `every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-362'>[12] <span>So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-363'>[13] <span>Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-364'>[14] <span>As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-2" id="niv-verse-14-2">b</a>]</sup><span> is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</span></div>

<div id='verse-365'>[15] <span>If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-366'>[16] <span>Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil.</span></div>

<div id='verse-367'>[17] <span>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,</span></div>

<div id='verse-368'>[18] <span>because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-369'>[19] <span>Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.</span></div>

<div id='verse-370'>[20] <span>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</span></div>

<div id='verse-371'>[21] <span>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.</span></div>

<div id='verse-372'>[22] <span>So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-373'>[23] <span>But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-374'>[1] <span>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.</span></div>

<div id='verse-375'>[2] <span>Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[3] <span>For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-377'>[4] <span>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[5] <span>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[6] <span>so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-380'>[7] <span>Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-381'>[8] <span>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-2" id="niv-verse-15-2">b</a>]</sup><span> on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs</span></div>

<div id='verse-382'>[9] <span>so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to your name." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-3" id="niv-verse-15-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-383'>[10] <span>Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-4" id="niv-verse-15-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-384'>[11] <span>And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you peoples." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-5" id="niv-verse-15-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-385'>[12] <span>And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will hope in him." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-6" id="niv-verse-15-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-386'>[13] <span>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[14] <span>I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another.</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[15] <span>I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[16] <span>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[17] <span>Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-391'>[18] <span>I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done--</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[19] <span>by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[20] <span>It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[21] <span>Rather, as it is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-7" id="niv-verse-15-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-395'>[22] <span>This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[23] <span>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you,</span></div>

<div id='verse-397'>[24] <span>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[25] <span>Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.</span></div>

<div id='verse-399'>[26] <span>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[27] <span>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-401'>[28] <span>So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.</span></div>

<div id='verse-402'>[29] <span>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-403'>[30] <span>I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-404'>[31] <span>Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,</span></div>

<div id='verse-405'>[32] <span>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-406'>[33] <span>The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span></div>
