<h3>Romans 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>and who through the Spirit 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_1">1</a>]</sup> of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_2">2</a>]</sup> by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_3">3</a>]</sup> just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_4">4</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-1-26'>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='27'><li id='verse-1-27'>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-1-28'>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='29'><li id='verse-1-29'>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='30'><li id='verse-1-30'>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='31'><li id='verse-1-31'>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='32'><li id='verse-1-32'>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

<h3>Romans 5</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-5-1'>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup> have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-5-2'>through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_2">2</a>]</sup> rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-5-3'>Not only so, but we 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_3">3</a>]</sup> also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-5-4'>perseverance, character; and character, hope.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-5-5'>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-5-6'>You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-5-7'>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-5-8'>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-5-9'>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-5-10'>For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-5-11'>Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-5-12'>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-5-13'>for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-5-14'>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-5-15'>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-5-16'>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-5-17'>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-5-18'>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-5-19'>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-5-20'>The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-5-21'>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-6-13'>Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-6-14'>For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>

</li></ol>

<h3>Romans 7</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-7-1'>Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-7-2'>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-7-3'>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-7-4'>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-7-5'>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-7-6'>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-7-7'>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_2">2</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-7-8'>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-7-9'>Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-7-10'>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-7-11'>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-7-12'>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-7-13'>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-7-14'>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-7-15'>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-7-16'>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-7-17'>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-7-18'>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_3">3</a>]</sup> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-7-19'>For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-7-20'>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-7-21'>So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-7-22'>For in my inner being I delight in God's law;
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-7-23'>but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-7-24'>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-7-25'>Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-10-3'>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-10-6'>But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?'

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-10-9'>That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

<h3>Romans 13</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-13-1'>Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-13-2'>Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-13-3'>For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-13-5'>Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.

<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-13-6'>This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.
