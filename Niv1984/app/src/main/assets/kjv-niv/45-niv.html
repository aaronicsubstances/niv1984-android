<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>and who through the Spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[32] <span>Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[1] <span>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[2] <span>Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[3] <span>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[4] <span>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[5] <span>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[6] <span>God "will give to each person according to what he has done." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[7] <span>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[8] <span>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[9] <span>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[10] <span>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[11] <span>For God does not show favoritism.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[12] <span>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[13] <span>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[14] <span>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[15] <span>since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[16] <span>This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[17] <span>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[18] <span>if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[19] <span>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[20] <span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[21] <span>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[22] <span>You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[25] <span>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[26] <span>If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[27] <span>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[28] <span>A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[29] <span>No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[1] <span>What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[2] <span>Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[3] <span>What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[4] <span>Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[5] <span>But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[6] <span>Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[7] <span>Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[8] <span>Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[11] <span>there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[12] <span>All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[19] <span>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[20] <span>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[21] <span>But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[22] <span>This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[23] <span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[24] <span>and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[25] <span>God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-9" id="niv-verse-3-9">i</a>]</sup><span> through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[26] <span>he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[27] <span>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[28] <span>For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[1] <span>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[2] <span>If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[3] <span>What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[4] <span>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[5] <span>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[6] <span>David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'>[9] <span>Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[12] <span>And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[13] <span>It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'>[14] <span>For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'>[15] <span>because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-118'>[19] <span>Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-119'>[20] <span>Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-126'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[1] <span>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'>[2] <span>through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[3] <span>Not only so, but we </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup><span> also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[4] <span>perseverance, character; and character, hope.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[5] <span>And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[6] <span>You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[7] <span>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[8] <span>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[9] <span>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[10] <span>For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'>[11] <span>Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[12] <span>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[13] <span>for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[14] <span>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[15] <span>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[16] <span>Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[17] <span>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[18] <span>Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[19] <span>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[20] <span>The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'>[21] <span>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[2] <span>By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[3] <span>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'>[4] <span>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[5] <span>If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[6] <span>For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> that we should no longer be slaves to sin--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[7] <span>because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[8] <span>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[9] <span>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[10] <span>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[11] <span>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[12] <span>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[13] <span>Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[14] <span>For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[15] <span>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[16] <span>Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[17] <span>But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[18] <span>You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[19] <span>I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[20] <span>When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-174'>Chapter 7</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'>[1] <span>Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'>[2] <span>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'>[3] <span>So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'>[4] <span>So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'>[5] <span>For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'>[6] <span>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'>[7] <span>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'>[8] <span>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'>[9] <span>Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'>[10] <span>I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'>[11] <span>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'>[12] <span>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'>[13] <span>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-188'>[14] <span>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-189'>[15] <span>I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-190'>[16] <span>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'>[17] <span>As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[18] <span>I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-3" id="niv-verse-7-3">c</a>]</sup><span> For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[19] <span>For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[20] <span>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'>[21] <span>So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-196'>[22] <span>For in my inner being I delight in God's law;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-197'>[23] <span>but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-198'>[24] <span>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-199'>[25] <span>Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-243'>[1] <span>I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-244'>[2] <span>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-245'>[3] <span>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-246'>[4] <span>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-247'>[5] <span>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-248'>[6] <span>It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-249'>[7] <span>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-250'>[8] <span>In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-251'>[9] <span>For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-3" id="niv-verse-9-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[10] <span>Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-253'>[11] <span>Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[16] <span>It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[17] <span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-7" id="niv-verse-9-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-260'>[18] <span>Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-261'>[19] <span>One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?"</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[27] <span>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[30] <span>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[32] <span>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone."</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-277'>Chapter 10</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'>[1] <span>Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'>[2] <span>For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'>[3] <span>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'>[4] <span>Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'>[5] <span>Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: "The man who does these things will live by them." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283'>[6] <span>But the righteousness that is by faith says: "Do not say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">b</a>]</sup><span> " (that is, to bring Christ down)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'>[7] <span>"or `Who will descend into the deep?' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-3" id="niv-verse-10-3">c</a>]</sup><span> " (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'>[8] <span>But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-4" id="niv-verse-10-4">d</a>]</sup><span> that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'>[9] <span>That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'>[10] <span>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-288'>[11] <span>As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-289'>[12] <span>For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-290'>[13] <span>for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-6" id="niv-verse-10-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-291'>[14] <span>How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-292'>[15] <span>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-7" id="niv-verse-10-7">g</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-293'>[16] <span>But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-8" id="niv-verse-10-8">h</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-294'>[17] <span>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-295'>[18] <span>But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-9" id="niv-verse-10-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-296'>[19] <span>Again I ask: Did Israel not understand?

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-300'>Chapter 11</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-301'>[1] <span>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-302'>[2] <span>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-303'>[3] <span>"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-1" id="niv-verse-11-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-304'>[4] <span>And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-2" id="niv-verse-11-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-305'>[5] <span>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-306'>[6] <span>And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-3" id="niv-verse-11-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-307'>[7] <span>What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-308'>[8] <span>as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-11-4" id="niv-verse-11-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-309'>[9] <span>And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-311'>[11] <span>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-312'>[12] <span>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-313'>[13] <span>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-314'>[14] <span>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-315'>[15] <span>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-316'>[16] <span>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-318'>[18] <span>do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-319'>[19] <span>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-320'>[20] <span>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-321'>[21] <span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-322'>[22] <span>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-323'>[23] <span>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-324'>[24] <span>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-325'>[25] <span>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-326'>[26] <span>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-330'>[30] <span>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'>[1] <span>Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'>[2] <span>Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'>[3] <span>For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'>[4] <span>For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'>[5] <span>Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'>[6] <span>This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'>[7] <span>Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'>[8] <span>Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.</span></div>

But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'>[15] <span>If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'>[16] <span>Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'>[17] <span>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'>[18] <span>because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'>[19] <span>Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'>[20] <span>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'>[21] <span>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'>[22] <span>So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.</span></div>
