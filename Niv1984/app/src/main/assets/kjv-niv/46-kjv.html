<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, called </span><i>to be</i><span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes </span><i>our</i><span> brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called </span><i>to be</i><span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and </span><i>in</i><span> all knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, </span><i>that ye may be</i><span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>God </span><i>is</i><span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and </span><i>that</i><span> there be no divisions among you; but </span><i>that</i><span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them </span><i>which are of the house</i><span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Where </span><i>is</i><span> the wise? where </span><i>is</i><span> the scribe? where </span><i>is</i><span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, </span><i>are called</i><span>:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, </span><i>yea</i><span>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'>[30] <span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'>[31] <span>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[1] <span>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[2] <span>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[3] <span>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[4] <span>And my speech and my preaching </span><i>was</i><span> not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[5] <span>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[6] <span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[7] <span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, </span><i>even</i><span> the hidden </span><i>wisdom</i><span>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[8] <span>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known </span><i>it</i><span>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[9] <span>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[10] <span>But God hath revealed </span><i>them</i><span> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[11] <span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[12] <span>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[13] <span>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[14] <span>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know </span><i>them</i><span>, because they are spiritually discerned.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[15] <span>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[16] <span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[1] <span>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, </span><i>even</i><span> as unto babes in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[2] <span>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able </span><i>to bear it</i><span>, neither yet now are ye able.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[3] <span>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas </span><i>there is</i><span> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'>[4] <span>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I </span><i>am</i><span> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[5] <span>Who then is Paul, and who </span><i>is</i><span> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[6] <span>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[7] <span>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[8] <span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[9] <span>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, </span><i>ye are</i><span> God's building.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[10] <span>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[11] <span>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[13] <span>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[14] <span>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'>[15] <span>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'>[16] <span>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and </span><i>that</i><span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'>[17] <span>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which </span><i>temple</i><span> ye are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[18] <span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'>[19] <span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[20] <span>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[21] <span>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-144'>[7] <span>For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-148'>[11] <span>But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to </span><i>her</i><span> husband: and let not the husband put away </span><i>his</i><span> wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-149'>[12] <span>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-150'>[13] <span>And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-151'>[14] <span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-152'>[15] <span>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such </span><i>cases</i><span>: but God hath called us to peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-153'>[16] <span>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save </span><i>thy</i><span> husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save </span><i>thy</i><span> wife?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-154'>[17] <span>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-155'>[18] <span>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-156'>[19] <span>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-157'>[20] <span>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-158'>[21] <span>Art thou called </span><i>being</i><span> a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use </span><i>it</i><span> rather.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-159'>[22] <span>For he that is called in the Lord, </span><i>being</i><span> a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, </span><i>being</i><span> free, is Christ's servant.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-160'>[23] <span>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-161'>[24] <span>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-162'>[25] <span>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-163'>[26] <span>I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, </span><i>I say</i><span>, that </span><i>it is</i><span> good for a man so to be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-164'>[27] <span>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-165'>[28] <span>But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-166'>[29] <span>But this I say, brethren, the time </span><i>is</i><span> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-167'>[30] <span>And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-168'>[31] <span>And they that use this world, as not abusing </span><i>it</i><span>: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-169'>[32] <span>But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-170'>[33] <span>But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please </span><i>his</i><span> wife.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-171'>[34] <span>There is difference </span><i>also</i><span> between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please </span><i>her</i><span> husband.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-172'>[35] <span>And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-173'>[36] <span>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of </span><i>her</i><span> age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-174'>[37] <span>Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-175'>[38] <span>So then he that giveth </span><i>her</i><span> in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth </span><i>her</i><span> not in marriage doeth better.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-176'>[39] <span>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-177'>[40] <span>But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-276'>[18] <span>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-281'>[23] <span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the </span><i>same</i><span> night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-282'>[24] <span>And when he had given thanks, he brake </span><i>it</i><span>, and said, </span><span class="wj">Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-283'>[25] <span>After the same manner also </span><i>he took</i><span> the cup, when he had supped, saying, </span><span class="wj">This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, in remembrance of me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-284'>[26] <span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-302'>[8] <span>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-317'>[23] <span>And those </span><i>members</i><span> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely </span><i>parts</i><span> have more abundant comeliness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-318'>[24] <span>For our comely </span><i>parts</i><span> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that </span><i>part</i><span> which lacked:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-412'>[28] <span>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-413'>[29] <span>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-414'>[30] <span>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-415'>[31] <span>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-416'>[32] <span>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-417'>[33] <span>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-418'>[34] <span>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak </span><i>this</i><span> to your shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-419'>[35] <span>But some </span><i>man</i><span> will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-420'>[36] <i>Thou</i><span> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-421'>[37] <span>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other </span><i>grain</i><span>:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-422'>[38] <span>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-423'>[39] <span>All flesh </span><i>is</i><span> not the same flesh: but </span><i>there is</i><span> one </span><i>kind of</i><span> flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, </span><i>and</i><span> another of birds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-424'>[40] <i>There are</i><span> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial </span><i>is</i><span> one, and the </span><i>glory</i><span> of the terrestrial </span><i>is</i><span> another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-425'>[41] <i>There is</i><span> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for </span><i>one</i><span> star differeth from </span><i>another</i><span> star in glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-426'>[42] <span>So also </span><i>is</i><span> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-427'>[43] <span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-428'>[44] <span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-429'>[45] <span>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam </span><i>was made</i><span> a quickening spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-430'>[46] <span>Howbeit that </span><i>was</i><span> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-431'>[47] <span>The first man </span><i>is</i><span> of the earth, earthy: the second man </span><i>is</i><span> the Lord from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-432'>[48] <span>As </span><i>is</i><span> the earthy, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are earthy: and as </span><i>is</i><span> the heavenly, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are heavenly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-433'>[49] <span>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-434'>[50] <span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-435'>[51] <span>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-436'>[52] <span>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-437'>[53] <span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal </span><i>must</i><span> put on immortality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-438'>[54] <span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-439'>[55] <span>O death, where </span><i>is</i><span> thy sting? O grave, where </span><i>is</i><span> thy victory?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-440'>[56] <span>The sting of death </span><i>is</i><span> sin; and the strength of sin </span><i>is</i><span> the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-441'>[57] <span>But thanks </span><i>be</i><span> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-442'>[58] <span>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</span></div>
