<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, called </span><i>to be</i><span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes </span><i>our</i><span> brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called </span><i>to be</i><span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and </span><i>in</i><span> all knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, </span><i>that ye may be</i><span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God </span><i>is</i><span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and </span><i>that</i><span> there be no divisions among you; but </span><i>that</i><span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them </span><i>which are of the house</i><span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Where </span><i>is</i><span> the wise? where </span><i>is</i><span> the scribe? where </span><i>is</i><span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, </span><i>are called</i><span>:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, </span><i>yea</i><span>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, </span><i>even</i><span> the hidden </span><i>wisdom</i><span>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known </span><i>it</i><span>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But God hath revealed </span><i>them</i><span> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-387'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-388'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-389'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-390'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-391'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-392'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-393'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-394'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which </span><i>was bestowed</i><span> upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-395'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Therefore whether </span><i>it were</i><span> I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <i>There are</i><span> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial </span><i>is</i><span> one, and the </span><i>glory</i><span> of the terrestrial </span><i>is</i><span> another.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So also </span><i>is</i><span> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-427'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-428'><span class='verse-num'>[44]</span> <span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-429'><span class='verse-num'>[45]</span> <span>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam </span><i>was made</i><span> a quickening spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-430'><span class='verse-num'>[46]</span> <span>Howbeit that </span><i>was</i><span> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-431'><span class='verse-num'>[47]</span> <span>The first man </span><i>is</i><span> of the earth, earthy: the second man </span><i>is</i><span> the Lord from heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-432'><span class='verse-num'>[48]</span> <span>As </span><i>is</i><span> the earthy, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are earthy: and as </span><i>is</i><span> the heavenly, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are heavenly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-433'><span class='verse-num'>[49]</span> <span>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-434'><span class='verse-num'>[50]</span> <span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-435'><span class='verse-num'>[51]</span> <span>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-436'><span class='verse-num'>[52]</span> <span>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-437'><span class='verse-num'>[53]</span> <span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal </span><i>must</i><span> put on immortality.</span></div>
