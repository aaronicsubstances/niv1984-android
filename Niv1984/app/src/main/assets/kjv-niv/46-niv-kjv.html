<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, </span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Paul, called </span><i>to be</i><span> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes </span><i>our</i><span> brother,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours: </span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called </span><i>to be</i><span> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and </span><i>in</i><span> all knowledge;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, </span><i>that ye may be</i><span> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>God </span><i>is</i><span> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and </span><i>that</i><span> there be no divisions among you; but </span><i>that</i><span> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them </span><i>which are of the house</i><span> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> "; still another, "I follow Christ."</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Where </span><i>is</i><span> the wise? where </span><i>is</i><span> the scribe? where </span><i>is</i><span> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, </span><i>are called</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, </span><i>yea</i><span>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so that no one may boast before him.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And my speech and my preaching </span><i>was</i><span> not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, </span><i>even</i><span> the hidden </span><i>wisdom</i><span>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known </span><i>it</i><span>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> --</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But God hath revealed </span><i>them</i><span> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, </span><i>even</i><span> as unto babes in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able </span><i>to bear it</i><span>, neither yet now are ye able.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas </span><i>there is</i><span> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I </span><i>am</i><span> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who then is Paul, and who </span><i>is</i><span> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, </span><i>ye are</i><span> God's building.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and </span><i>that</i><span> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which </span><i>temple</i><span> ye are.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> ;</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: </span><i>It is</i><span> good for a man not to touch a woman.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nevertheless, </span><i>to avoid</i><span> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I speak this by permission, </span><i>and</i><span> not of commandment.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the man who loves God is known by God.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol </span><i>is</i><span> nothing in the world, and that </span><i>there is</i><span> none other God but one.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But to us </span><i>there is but</i><span> one God, the Father, of whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, and we by him.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Howbeit </span><i>there is</i><span> not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat </span><i>it</i><span> as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered </span><i>them</i><span> to you.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman </span><i>is</i><span> the man; and the head of Christ </span><i>is</i><span> God.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When ye come together therefore into one place, </span><i>this</i><span> is not to eat the Lord's supper.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the </span><i>same</i><span> night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>After the same manner also </span><i>he took</i><span> the cup, when he had supped, saying, </span><span class="wj">This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink </span><i class="wj">it</i><span class="wj">, in remembrance of me.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink </span><i>this</i><span> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of </span><i>that</i><span> bread, and drink of </span><i>that</i><span> cup.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this cause many </span><i>are</i><span> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and </span><i>that</i><span> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also </span><i>is</i><span> Christ.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if they were all one member, where </span><i>were</i><span> the body?</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And those </span><i>members</i><span> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely </span><i>parts</i><span> have more abundant comeliness.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For our comely </span><i>parts</i><span> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that </span><i>part</i><span> which lacked:</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That there should be no schism in the body; but </span><i>that</i><span> the members should have the same care one for another.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Charity never faileth: but whether </span><i>there be</i><span> prophecies, they shall fail; whether </span><i>there be</i><span> tongues, they shall cease; whether </span><i>there be</i><span> knowledge, it shall vanish away.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Follow after charity, and desire spiritual </span><i>gifts</i><span>, but rather that ye may prophesy.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For anyone who speaks in a tongue </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">1</a>]</sup><span> does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-2" id="niv-verse-14-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he that speaketh in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth </span><i>him</i><span>; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men </span><i>to</i><span> edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>He that speaketh in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">3</a>]</sup><span> but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">4</a>]</sup><span> unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater </span><i>is</i><span> he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them </span><i>is</i><span> without signification.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh </span><i>shall be</i><span> a barbarian unto me.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual </span><i>gifts</i><span>, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue pray that he may interpret.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if I pray in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-5" id="niv-verse-14-5">5</a>]</sup><span> say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that </span><i>by my voice</i><span> I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the Law it is written: "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">6</a>]</sup><span> says the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In the law it is written, With </span><i>men of</i><span> other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying </span><i>serveth</i><span> not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">7</a>]</sup><span> or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in </span><i>those that are</i><span> unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">8</a>]</sup><span> comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or </span><i>one</i><span> unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on </span><i>his</i><span> face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man speak in an </span><i>unknown</i><span> tongue, </span><i>let it be</i><span> by two, or at the most </span><i>by</i><span> three, and </span><i>that</i><span> by course; and let one interpret.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If </span><i>any thing</i><span> be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For God is not </span><i>the author</i><span> of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but </span><i>they are commanded</i><span> to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>KJV</b>] <span>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[38 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-9" id="niv-verse-14-9">9</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[39 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</span></div>
<div>[39 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The last enemy </span><i>that</i><span> shall be destroyed </span><i>is</i><span> death.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For he "has put everything under his feet." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-3" id="niv-verse-15-3">3</a>]</sup><span> Now when it says that "everything" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under </span><i>him, it is</i><span> manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-4" id="niv-verse-15-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character."</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak </span><i>this</i><span> to your shame.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But someone may ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?"</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But some </span><i>man</i><span> will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>NIV</b>] <span>How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Thou</i><span> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other </span><i>grain</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[38 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</span></div>
<div>[38 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span></div>
<div>[39 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</span></div>
<div>[39 <b>KJV</b>] <span>All flesh </span><i>is</i><span> not the same flesh: but </span><i>there is</i><span> one </span><i>kind of</i><span> flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, </span><i>and</i><span> another of birds.</span></div>
<div>[40 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</span></div>
<div>[40 <b>KJV</b>] <i>There are</i><span> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial </span><i>is</i><span> one, and the </span><i>glory</i><span> of the terrestrial </span><i>is</i><span> another.</span></div>
<div>[41 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</span></div>
<div>[41 <b>KJV</b>] <i>There is</i><span> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for </span><i>one</i><span> star differeth from </span><i>another</i><span> star in glory.</span></div>
<div>[42 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</span></div>
<div>[42 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So also </span><i>is</i><span> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span></div>
<div>[43 <b>NIV</b>] <span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span></div>
<div>[43 <b>KJV</b>] <span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span></div>
<div>[44 <b>NIV</b>] <span>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</span></div>
<div>[44 <b>KJV</b>] <span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span></div>
<div>[45 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-5" id="niv-verse-15-5">5</a>]</sup><span> ; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</span></div>
<div>[45 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam </span><i>was made</i><span> a quickening spirit.</span></div>
<div>[46 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.</span></div>
<div>[46 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Howbeit that </span><i>was</i><span> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span></div>
<div>[47 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.</span></div>
<div>[47 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The first man </span><i>is</i><span> of the earth, earthy: the second man </span><i>is</i><span> the Lord from heaven.</span></div>
<div>[48 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</span></div>
<div>[48 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As </span><i>is</i><span> the earthy, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are earthy: and as </span><i>is</i><span> the heavenly, such </span><i>are</i><span> they also that are heavenly.</span></div>
<div>[49 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-6" id="niv-verse-15-6">6</a>]</sup><span> bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</span></div>
<div>[49 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span></div>
<div>[50 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</span></div>
<div>[50 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span></div>
<div>[51 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--</span></div>
<div>[51 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span></div>
<div>[52 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</span></div>
<div>[52 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span></div>
<div>[53 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</span></div>
<div>[53 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal </span><i>must</i><span> put on immortality.</span></div>
<div>[54 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: "Death has been swallowed up in victory." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-7" id="niv-verse-15-7">7</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[54 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span></div>
<div>[55 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-8" id="niv-verse-15-8">8</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[55 <b>KJV</b>] <span>O death, where </span><i>is</i><span> thy sting? O grave, where </span><i>is</i><span> thy victory?</span></div>
<div>[56 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span></div>
<div>[56 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The sting of death </span><i>is</i><span> sin; and the strength of sin </span><i>is</i><span> the law.</span></div>
<div>[57 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
