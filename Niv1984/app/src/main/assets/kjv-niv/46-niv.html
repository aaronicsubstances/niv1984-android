<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> "; still another, "I follow Christ."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the name of Paul?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>so that no one may boast before him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written."

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-172'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-268'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-276'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-283'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-284'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-285'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-286'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-287'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-343'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-344'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For anyone who speaks in a tongue </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-1" id="niv-verse-14-1">a</a>]</sup><span> does not speak to men but to God.

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-345'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-346'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-347'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-3" id="niv-verse-14-3">c</a>]</sup><span> but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-4" id="niv-verse-14-4">d</a>]</sup><span> unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-348'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-349'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-350'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-351'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-352'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-353'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-354'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-355'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-356'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-357'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-358'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-5" id="niv-verse-14-5">e</a>]</sup><span> say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-359'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-360'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-361'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-362'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-363'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>In the Law it is written: "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-6" id="niv-verse-14-6">f</a>]</sup><span> says the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-364'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-365'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-7" id="niv-verse-14-7">g</a>]</sup><span> or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-366'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-8" id="niv-verse-14-8">h</a>]</sup><span> comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-367'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-368'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-369'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-370'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-371'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-372'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-373'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-374'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-375'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-376'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-377'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-378'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-379'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-380'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-14-9" id="niv-verse-14-9">i</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-381'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-384'>Chapter 15</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-385'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-386'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-387'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-1" id="niv-verse-15-1">a</a>]</sup><span> : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-388'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-389'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>and that he appeared to Peter, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-2" id="niv-verse-15-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and then to the Twelve.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-390'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-391'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-392'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-393'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-394'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-395'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-396'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-397'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-398'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-399'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-400'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-401'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-402'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-403'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-404'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-405'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-406'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-407'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-408'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-409'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-410'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-411'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For he "has put everything under his feet." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-3" id="niv-verse-15-3">c</a>]</sup><span> Now when it says that "everything" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-412'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-413'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-414'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-415'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-416'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-15-4" id="niv-verse-15-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-417'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-418'><span class='verse-num'>[34]</span> <span>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-419'><span class='verse-num'>[35]</span> <span>But someone may ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-420'><span class='verse-num'>[36]</span> <span>How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-421'><span class='verse-num'>[37]</span> <span>When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-422'><span class='verse-num'>[38]</span> <span>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-423'><span class='verse-num'>[39]</span> <span>All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-424'><span class='verse-num'>[40]</span> <span>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-425'><span class='verse-num'>[41]</span> <span>The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-426'><span class='verse-num'>[42]</span> <span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-427'><span class='verse-num'>[43]</span> <span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span></div>
