<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'><b>(NIV)</b> When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?

<h3>2 Corinthians 2</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'><b>(NIV)</b> If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'><b>(NIV)</b> The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-2-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'><b>(NIV)</b> Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-2-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'><b>(NIV)</b> I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-2-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'><b>(NIV)</b> The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'><b>(NIV)</b> If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-2-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'><b>(NIV)</b> in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-2-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'><b>(NIV)</b> Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-2-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'><b>(NIV)</b> I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-2-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'><b>(NIV)</b> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'><b>(NIV)</b> For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-2-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'><b>(NIV)</b> To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-2-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'><b>(NIV)</b> Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-2-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</i>

<h3>2 Corinthians 3</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-3-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-3-4'><b>(NIV)</b> Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.

<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-3-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-3-6'><b>(NIV)</b> He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

<h3>2 Corinthians 5</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-5-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-5-2'><b>(NIV)</b> Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-5-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-5-4'><b>(NIV)</b> For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-5-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-5-5'><b>(NIV)</b> Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-5-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-5-6'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-5-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</i>

<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-5-7'><b>(NIV)</b> We live by faith, not by sight.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-5-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-5-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-5-13'><b>(NIV)</b> If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-5-14'><b>(NIV)</b> For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-5-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-5-16'><b>(NIV)</b> So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.

<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-7-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-7-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-7-2'><b>(NIV)</b> Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-7-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-7-3'><b>(NIV)</b> I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-7-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-7-4'><b>(NIV)</b> I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-7-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-7-5'><b>(NIV)</b> For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-7-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-7-6'><b>(NIV)</b> But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-7-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-7-7'><b>(NIV)</b> and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-7-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-7-8'><b>(NIV)</b> Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-7-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-7-9'><b>(NIV)</b> yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-7-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-7-10'><b>(NIV)</b> Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-7-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-7-11'><b>(NIV)</b> See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-7-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-7-12'><b>(NIV)</b> So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-7-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-7-13'><b>(NIV)</b> By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-7-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-7-14'><b>(NIV)</b> I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-7-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-7-15'><b>(NIV)</b> And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-7-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-7-16'><b>(NIV)</b> I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
</li></ol>

<h3>2 Corinthians 8</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-8-1'><b>(NIV)</b> And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-8-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-8-2'><b>(NIV)</b> Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-8-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-8-3'><b>(NIV)</b> For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-8-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-8-4'><b>(NIV)</b> they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-8-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-8-5'><b>(NIV)</b> And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-8-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-8-6'><b>(NIV)</b> So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-8-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-8-7'><b>(NIV)</b> But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_1">1</a>]</sup> --see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-8-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-8-8'><b>(NIV)</b> I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-8-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-8-9'><b>(NIV)</b> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-8-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-8-10'><b>(NIV)</b> And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-8-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-8-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-8-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-8-12'><b>(NIV)</b> For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-8-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-8-13'><b>(NIV)</b> Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-8-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-8-14'><b>(NIV)</b> At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-8-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-8-15'><b>(NIV)</b> as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_2">2</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-8-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-8-16'><b>(NIV)</b> I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-8-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-8-17'><b>(NIV)</b> For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-8-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-8-18'><b>(NIV)</b> And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.

<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-8-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-8-19'><b>(NIV)</b> What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-8-19'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-8-20'><b>(NIV)</b> We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-8-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-8-21'><b>(NIV)</b> For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-8-21'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-8-22'><b>(NIV)</b> In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-8-22'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</i>

<h3>2 Corinthians 9</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-9-1'><b>(NIV)</b> There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-9-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-9-2'><b>(NIV)</b> For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-9-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-9-3'><b>(NIV)</b> But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-9-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-9-4'><b>(NIV)</b> For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-9-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-9-5'><b>(NIV)</b> So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.
