<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: </span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy </span><i>our</i><span> brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> to you and peace from God our Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And whether we be afflicted, </span><i>it is</i><span> for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, </span><i>it is</i><span> for your consolation and salvation.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And our hope of you </span><i>is</i><span> stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so </span><i>shall ye be</i><span> also of the consolation.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver </span><i>us</i><span>;</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift </span><i>bestowed</i><span> upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also </span><i>are</i><span> ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But </span><i>as</i><span> God </span><i>is</i><span> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, </span><i>even</i><span> by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For all the promises of God in him </span><i>are</i><span> yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, </span><i>is</i><span> God;</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is </span><i>the joy</i><span> of you all.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Sufficient to such a man </span><i>is</i><span> this punishment, which </span><i>was inflicted</i><span> of many.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So that contrariwise ye </span><i>ought</i><span> rather to forgive </span><i>him</i><span>, and comfort </span><i>him</i><span>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm </span><i>your</i><span> love toward him.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To whom ye forgive any thing, I </span><i>forgive</i><span> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave </span><i>it</i><span>, for your sakes </span><i>forgave I it</i><span> in the person of Christ;</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to </span><i>preach</i><span> Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now thanks </span><i>be</i><span> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To the one </span><i>we are</i><span> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who </span><i>is</i><span> sufficient for these things?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some </span><i>others</i><span>, epistles of commendation to you, or </span><i>letters</i><span> of commendation from you?</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Forasmuch as ye are</i><span> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency </span><i>is</i><span> of God;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if the ministration of death, written </span><i>and</i><span> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which </span><i>glory</i><span> was to be done away:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if the ministration of condemnation </span><i>be</i><span> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if that which is done away </span><i>was</i><span> glorious, much more that which remaineth </span><i>is</i><span> glorious.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And not as Moses, </span><i>which</i><span> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which </span><i>vail</i><span> is done away in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord </span><i>is</i><span>, there </span><i>is</i><span> liberty.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, </span><i>even</i><span> as by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to </span><i>give</i><span> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <i>We are</i><span> troubled on every side, yet not distressed; </span><i>we are</i><span> perplexed, but not in despair;</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup><span> With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present </span><i>us</i><span> with you.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we know that if our earthly house of </span><i>this</i><span> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we that are in </span><i>this</i><span> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing </span><i>is</i><span> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore </span><i>we are</i><span> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We live by faith, not by sight.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>We are confident, </span><i>I say</i><span>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things </span><i>done</i><span> in </span><i>his</i><span> body, according to that he hath done, whether </span><i>it be</i><span> good or bad.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to </span><i>answer</i><span> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For whether we be beside ourselves, </span><i>it is</i><span> to God: or whether we be sober, </span><i>it is</i><span> for your cause.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we </span><i>him</i><span> no more.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore if any man </span><i>be</i><span> in Christ, </span><i>he is</i><span> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And all things </span><i>are</i><span> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech </span><i>you</i><span> by us: we pray </span><i>you</i><span> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>God made him who had no sin to be sin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">1</a>]</sup><span> for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he hath made him </span><i>to be</i><span> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>We then, </span><i>as</i><span> workers together </span><i>with him</i><span>, beseech </span><i>you</i><span> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">1</a>]</sup><span> I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now </span><i>is</i><span> the accepted time; behold, now </span><i>is</i><span> the day of salvation.)</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But in all </span><i>things</i><span> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and </span><i>yet</i><span> true;</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As unknown, and </span><i>yet</i><span> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and </span><i>yet</i><span> possessing all things.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>O </span><i>ye</i><span> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God.

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I speak not </span><i>this</i><span> to condemn </span><i>you</i><span>: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with </span><i>you</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Great </span><i>is</i><span> my boldness of speech toward you, great </span><i>is</i><span> my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without </span><i>were</i><span> fightings, within </span><i>were</i><span> fears.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though </span><i>it were</i><span> but for a season.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> clearing of yourselves, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> indignation, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> fear, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> vehement desire, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> zeal, yea, </span><i>what</i><span> revenge! In all </span><i>things</i><span> ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, </span><i>I did it</i><span> not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which </span><i>I made</i><span> before Titus, is found a truth.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For to </span><i>their</i><span> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond </span><i>their</i><span> power </span><i>they were</i><span> willing of themselves;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and </span><i>take upon us</i><span> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>this they did</i><span>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And herein I give </span><i>my</i><span> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now therefore perform the doing </span><i>of it</i><span>; that as </span><i>there was</i><span> a readiness to will, so </span><i>there may be</i><span> a performance also out of that which ye have.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if there be first a willing mind, </span><i>it is</i><span> accepted according to that a man hath, </span><i>and</i><span> not according to that he hath not.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>I mean</i><span> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But by an equality, </span><i>that</i><span> now at this time your abundance </span><i>may be a supply</i><span> for their want, that their abundance also may be </span><i>a supply</i><span> for your want: that there may be equality:</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As it is written, He that </span><i>had gathered</i><span> much had nothing over; and he that </span><i>had gathered</i><span> little had no lack.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But thanks </span><i>be</i><span> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as </span><i>a matter of</i><span> bounty, and not as </span><i>of</i><span> covetousness.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But this </span><i>I say</i><span>, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, </span><i>so let him give</i><span>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for </span><i>your</i><span> liberal distribution unto them, and unto all </span><i>men</i><span>;</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present </span><i>you as</i><span> a chaste virgin to Christ.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I desired Titus, and with </span><i>him</i><span> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? </span><i>walked we</i><span> not in the same steps?</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but </span><i>we do</i><span> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and </span><i>that</i><span> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest </span><i>there be</i><span> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <i>And</i><span> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and </span><i>that</i><span> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> the third </span><i>time</i><span> I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him to serve you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, </span><i>even</i><span> your perfection.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority--the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</span></div>
