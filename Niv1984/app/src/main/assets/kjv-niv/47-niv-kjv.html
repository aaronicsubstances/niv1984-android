<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>15</b> NIV]</span> <span>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>16</b> NIV]</span> <span>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>18</b> NIV]</span> <span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>18</b> KJV]</span> <span>But </span><i>as</i><span> God </span><i>is</i><span> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>20</b> NIV]</span> <span>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>21</b> NIV]</span> <span>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>2</b> NIV]</span> <span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>3</b> NIV]</span> <span>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>4</b> NIV]</span> <span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>4</b> KJV]</span> <span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[<b>8</b> NIV]</span> <span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</span></div>
