<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-27'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[1] <span>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[2] <span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[3] <span>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[4] <span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[5] <span>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[6] <span>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[7] <span>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[8] <span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[9] <span>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[10] <span>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[11] <span>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[12] <span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[13] <span>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[14] <span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[15] <span>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[16] <span>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[17] <span>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-3'>
<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-46'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[1] <span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[2] <span>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[3] <span>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[4] <span>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[5] <span>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[6] <span>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[7] <span>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[8] <span>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[9] <span>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[10] <span>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[11] <span>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[12] <span>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[13] <span>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[14] <span>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[15] <span>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[16] <span>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[17] <span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[18] <span>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-66'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[1] <span>Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[2] <span>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[3] <span>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[4] <span>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[5] <span>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[6] <span>For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[7] <span>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[8] <span>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[9] <span>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[10] <span>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[11] <span>For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[12] <span>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[13] <span>It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup><span> With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[14] <span>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[15] <span>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[16] <span>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[17] <span>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[18] <span>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-86'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[1] <span>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[2] <span>Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[3] <span>because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[4] <span>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[5] <span>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[6] <span>Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[7] <span>We live by faith, not by sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[8] <span>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[9] <span>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[10] <span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[11] <span>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[12] <span>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[13] <span>If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[14] <span>For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[15] <span>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[16] <span>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[17] <span>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[18] <span>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[19] <span>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[20] <span>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[21] <span>God made him who had no sin to be sin </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[7] <span>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'>[8] <span>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[9] <span>yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[10] <span>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[11] <span>See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-141'>[12] <span>So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-142'>[13] <span>By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[14] <span>I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[15] <span>And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[16] <span>I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-147'>Chapter 8</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[1] <span>And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[2] <span>Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[3] <span>For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[4] <span>they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[5] <span>And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'>[6] <span>So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[7] <span>But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-1" id="niv-verse-8-1">a</a>]</sup><span> --see that you also excel in this grace of giving.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[8] <span>I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[9] <span>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[10] <span>And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[11] <span>Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[12] <span>For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[13] <span>Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[14] <span>At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-162'>[15] <span>as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-8-2" id="niv-verse-8-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-163'>[16] <span>I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-164'>[17] <span>For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-165'>[18] <span>And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-166'>[19] <span>What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-167'>[20] <span>We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-168'>[21] <span>For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-169'>[22] <span>In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-170'>[23] <span>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-171'>[24] <span>Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-174'>[1] <span>There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-175'>[2] <span>For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-176'>[3] <span>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-177'>[4] <span>For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-178'>[5] <span>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-179'>[6] <span>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-180'>[7] <span>Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-181'>[8] <span>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-182'>[9] <span>As it is written: "He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-183'>[10] <span>Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-184'>[11] <span>You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-185'>[12] <span>This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-186'>[13] <span>Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-187'>[14] <span>And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-191'>[1] <span>By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you--I, Paul, who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" when away!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-192'>[2] <span>I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-193'>[3] <span>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-194'>[4] <span>The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-195'>[5] <span>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-202'>[12] <span>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-203'>[13] <span>We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-204'>[14] <span>We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-252'>[7] <span>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-254'>[9] <span>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-258'>[13] <span>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-259'>[14] <span>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-269'>[1] <span>This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-13-1" id="niv-verse-13-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-270'>[2] <span>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-271'>[3] <span>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-272'>[4] <span>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him to serve you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-273'>[5] <span>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-274'>[6] <span>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-275'>[7] <span>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-276'>[8] <span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-277'>[9] <span>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-278'>[10] <span>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority--the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-279'>[11] <span>Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-280'>[12] <span>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-281'>[13] <span>All the saints send their greetings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-282'>[14] <span>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. </span></div>
