<h3>Galatians 1</h3>

<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!

<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'><b>(NIV)</b> As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'><b>(NIV)</b> I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.

<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'><b>(NIV)</b> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'><b>(NIV)</b> Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter

<h3>Galatians 2</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> [This matter arose] because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'><b>(NIV)</b> We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.

<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'><b>(NIV)</b> As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-2-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'><b>(NIV)</b> On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'><b>(NIV)</b> For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-2-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</i>

So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'><b>(NIV)</b> "If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
