<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia: </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> to you and peace from God the Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>To whom </span><i>be</i><span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>As we said before, so say I now again, If any </span><i>man</i><span> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught </span><i>it</i><span>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But when God, who set me apart from birth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> and called me by his grace, was pleased</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called </span><i>me</i><span> by his grace,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> and stayed with him fifteen days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</span></div></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with </span><i>me</i><span> also.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>[This matter arose] because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed </span><i>to be somewhat</i><span> in conference added nothing to me:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> just as Peter had been to the Jews. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as </span><i>the gospel</i><span> of the circumcision </span><i>was</i><span> unto Peter;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>James, Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup><span> and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we </span><i>should go</i><span> unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Only </span><i>they would</i><span> that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before </span><i>them</i><span> all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>"We who are Jews by birth and not `Gentile sinners'</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>We </span><i>who are</i><span> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>"If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, </span><i>is</i><span> therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a lawbreaker.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness </span><i>come</i><span> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-7" id="niv-verse-3-7">7</a>]</sup><span> meaning one person, who is Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>And this I say, </span><i>that</i><span> the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For if the inheritance </span><i>be</i><span> of the law, </span><i>it is</i><span> no more of promise: but God gave </span><i>it</i><span> to Abraham by promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>Wherefore then </span><i>serveth</i><span> the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; </span><i>and it was</i><span> ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Now a mediator is not </span><i>a mediator</i><span> of one, but God is one.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <i>Is</i><span> the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-8" id="niv-verse-3-8">8</a>]</sup><span> that we might be justified by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster </span><i>to bring us</i><span> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Now I say, </span><i>That</i><span> the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Father."</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I </span><i>am</i><span>; for I </span><i>am</i><span> as ye </span><i>are</i><span>: ye have not injured me at all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, </span><i>even</i><span> as Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if </span><i>it had been</i><span> possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you [from us], so that you may be zealous for them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>They zealously affect you, </span><i>but</i><span> not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>But </span><i>it is</i><span> good to be zealously affected always in </span><i>a</i><span> good </span><i>thing</i><span>, and not only when I am present with you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>But he </span><i>who was</i><span> of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman </span><i>was</i><span> by promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[24] <span>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[25] <span>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[26] <span>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For it is written: "Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[27] <span>For it is written, Rejoice, </span><i>thou</i><span> barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[28] <span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[29] <span>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him </span><i>that was born</i><span> after the Spirit, even so </span><i>it is</i><span> now.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">3</a>]</sup> </div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[30] <span>Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[31] <span>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>for each one should carry his own load.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For every man shall bear his own burden.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span></div></div>
