<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> to you and peace from God the Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To whom </span><i>be</i><span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>As we said before, so say I now again, If any </span><i>man</i><span> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught </span><i>it</i><span>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called </span><i>me</i><span> by his grace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And they glorified God in me.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-27'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with </span><i>me</i><span> also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed </span><i>to be somewhat</i><span> in conference added nothing to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as </span><i>the gospel</i><span> of the circumcision </span><i>was</i><span> unto Peter;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we </span><i>should go</i><span> unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Only </span><i>they would</i><span> that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before </span><i>them</i><span> all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>We </span><i>who are</i><span> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, </span><i>is</i><span> therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness </span><i>come</i><span> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if </span><i>it be</i><span> yet in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, </span><i>doeth he it</i><span> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, </span><i>saying</i><span>, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed </span><i>is</i><span> every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, </span><i>it is</i><span> evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed </span><i>is</i><span> every one that hangeth on a tree:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though </span><i>it be</i><span> but a man's covenant, yet </span><i>if it be</i><span> confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-67'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>And this I say, </span><i>that</i><span> the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For if the inheritance </span><i>be</i><span> of the law, </span><i>it is</i><span> no more of promise: but God gave </span><i>it</i><span> to Abraham by promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Wherefore then </span><i>serveth</i><span> the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; </span><i>and it was</i><span> ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Now a mediator is not </span><i>a mediator</i><span> of one, but God is one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <i>Is</i><span> the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster </span><i>to bring us</i><span> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-75'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-76'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-78'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>And if ye </span><i>be</i><span> Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-143'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-144'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-145'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-146'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-150'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-151'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-154'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-155'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-156'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span></div>
