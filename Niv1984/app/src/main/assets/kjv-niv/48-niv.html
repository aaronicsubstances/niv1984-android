<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>But when God, who set me apart from birth </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and called me by his grace, was pleased</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and stayed with him fifteen days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And they praised God because of me.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-27'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[1] <span>Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[2] <span>I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[3] <span>Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[4] <span>[This matter arose] because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[5] <span>We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[6] <span>As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[7] <span>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> just as Peter had been to the Jews. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[8] <span>For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[9] <span>James, Peter </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[10] <span>All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[11] <span>When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[12] <span>Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[13] <span>The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[14] <span>When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[15] <span>"We who are Jews by birth and not `Gentile sinners'</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[16] <span>know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[17] <span>"If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[18] <span>If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a lawbreaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[19] <span>For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[20] <span>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[21] <span>I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-50'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[1] <span>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[2] <span>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[3] <span>Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[4] <span>Have you suffered so much for nothing--if it really was for nothing?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[5] <span>Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you heard?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[6] <span>Consider Abraham: "He believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[7] <span>Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[8] <span>The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: "All nations will be blessed through you." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[9] <span>So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[10] <span>All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[11] <span>Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-4" id="niv-verse-3-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[12] <span>The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-5" id="niv-verse-3-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[13] <span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-6" id="niv-verse-3-6">f</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[14] <span>He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[15] <span>Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[16] <span>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-7" id="niv-verse-3-7">g</a>]</sup><span> meaning one person, who is Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[17] <span>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[18] <span>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[19] <span>What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[20] <span>A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[21] <span>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[22] <span>But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[23] <span>Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[24] <span>So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-8" id="niv-verse-3-8">h</a>]</sup><span> that we might be justified by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[25] <span>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-76'>[26] <span>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[27] <span>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[28] <span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[29] <span>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></div>

<div>
<h2 id='niv-bookmark-81'>Chapter 4</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[1] <span>What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[2] <span>He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[3] <span>So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[4] <span>But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[5] <span>to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[6] <span>Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> Father."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[7] <span>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[8] <span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[9] <span>But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[10] <span>You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[11] <span>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[12] <span>I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[13] <span>As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[14] <span>Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[15] <span>What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[16] <span>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[17] <span>Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you [from us], so that you may be zealous for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[18] <span>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[19] <span>My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[20] <span>how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-102'>[21] <span>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-103'>[22] <span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-104'>[23] <span>His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-105'>[24] <span>These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-106'>[25] <span>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-107'>[26] <span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-108'>[27] <span>For it is written: "Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-109'>[28] <span>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-110'>[29] <span>At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[30] <span>But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[31] <span>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-127'>[13] <span>You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> ; rather, serve one another in love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-128'>[14] <span>The entire law is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-129'>[15] <span>If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-130'>[16] <span>So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-131'>[17] <span>For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-132'>[18] <span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-133'>[19] <span>The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-134'>[20] <span>idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-135'>[21] <span>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-136'>[22] <span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-137'>[23] <span>gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-138'>[24] <span>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-139'>[25] <span>Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-140'>[26] <span>Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[1] <span>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[2] <span>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[4] <span>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'>[5] <span>for each one should carry his own load.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[6] <span>Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[7] <span>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[8] <span>The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup><span> will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[9] <span>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[10] <span>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[12] <span>Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[13] <span>Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[14] <span>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-2" id="niv-verse-6-2">b</a>]</sup><span> the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[15] <span>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[16] <span>Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</span></div>
