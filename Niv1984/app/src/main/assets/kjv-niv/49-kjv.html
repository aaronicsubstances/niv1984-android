<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-130'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-131'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so </span><i>let</i><span> the wives </span><i>be</i><span> to their own husbands in every thing.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-135'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-136'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-137'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-138'><span class='verse-num'>[31]</span> <span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-139'><span class='verse-num'>[32]</span> <span>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-140'><span class='verse-num'>[33]</span> <span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife </span><i>see</i><span> that she reverence </span><i>her</i><span> husband.</span></div>
