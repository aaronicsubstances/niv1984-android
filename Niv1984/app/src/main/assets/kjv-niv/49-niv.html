<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>he </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will--</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>And he </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">d</a>]</sup><span> made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment--to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>In him we were also chosen, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">e</a>]</sup><span> having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession--to the praise of his glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">f</a>]</sup><span> of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-26'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[1] <span>As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[2] <span>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[3] <span>All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[4] <span>But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[5] <span>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[6] <span>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[7] <span>in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[8] <span>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[9] <span>not by works, so that no one can boast.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[10] <span>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[11] <span>Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[12] <span>remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[13] <span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[14] <span>For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[15] <span>by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[16] <span>and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[17] <span>He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[18] <span>For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[19] <span>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[20] <span>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[21] <span>In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[22] <span>And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[1] <span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[2] <span>Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[3] <span>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[4] <span>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[5] <span>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[6] <span>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[7] <span>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[8] <span>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[9] <span>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[10] <span>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[11] <span>according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[12] <span>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[13] <span>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[14] <span>For this reason I kneel before the Father,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[15] <span>from whom his whole family </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> in heaven and on earth derives its name.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[16] <span>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[17] <span>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[18] <span>may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[19] <span>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[20] <span>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[10] <span>He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[11] <span>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[12] <span>to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[13] <span>until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[14] <span>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[15] <span>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[16] <span>From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[17] <span>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[18] <span>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[19] <span>Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[20] <span>You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[21] <span>Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[22] <span>You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[23] <span>to be made new in the attitude of your minds;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[24] <span>and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-143'>[1] <span>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-144'>[2] <span>"Honor your father and mother"--which is the first commandment with a promise--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-145'>[3] <span>"that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-6-1" id="niv-verse-6-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-146'>[4] <span>Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-147'>[5] <span>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-148'>[6] <span>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-149'>[7] <span>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-150'>[8] <span>because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-151'>[9] <span>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-152'>[10] <span>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-153'>[11] <span>Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-154'>[12] <span>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-155'>[13] <span>Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-156'>[14] <span>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-157'>[15] <span>and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-158'>[16] <span>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-159'>[17] <span>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-160'>[18] <span>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-161'>[19] <span>Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,</span></div>
