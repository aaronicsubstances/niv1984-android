<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and </span><i>from</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform </span><i>it</i><span> until the day of Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and </span><i>in</i><span> all judgment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things </span><i>which happened</i><span> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other </span><i>places</i><span>;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>According to my earnest expectation and </span><i>my</i><span> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but </span><i>that</i><span> with all boldness, as always, </span><i>so</i><span> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether </span><i>it be</i><span> by life, or by death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For to me to live </span><i>is</i><span> Christ, and to die </span><i>is</i><span> gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But if I live in the flesh, this </span><i>is</i><span> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh </span><i>is</i><span> more needful for you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear </span><i>to be</i><span> in me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>If </span><i>there be</i><span> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, </span><i>being</i><span> of one accord, of one mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <i>Let</i><span> nothing </span><i>be done</i><span> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of </span><i>things</i><span> in heaven, and </span><i>things</i><span> in earth, and </span><i>things</i><span> under the earth;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ </span><i>is</i><span> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of </span><i>his</i><span> good pleasure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[28]</span> <span>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[29]</span> <span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[30]</span> <span>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-79'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-80'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</span></div>
