<h3>Philippians 1</h3>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><i>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><i>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><i>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><i>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><i>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><i>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-1-22'><i>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-1-23'><i>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-1-24'><i>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-1-25'><i>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-1-26'><i>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='27'><li id='kverse-1-27'><i>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='28'><li id='kverse-1-28'><i>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='29'><li id='kverse-1-29'><i>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='30'><li id='kverse-1-30'><i>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</i>

<h3>Philippians 2</h3>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><i>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><i>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><i>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><i>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><i>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-2-6'><i>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-2-7'><i>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-2-8'><i>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><i>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-2-10'><i>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-2-11'><i>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-2-12'><i>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-2-13'><i>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><i>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-2-15'><i>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-2-16'><i>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-2-17'><i>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-2-18'><i>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-2-19'><i>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-2-20'><i>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-2-21'><i>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-2-22'><i>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-2-23'><i>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-2-24'><i>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-2-25'><i>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-2-26'><i>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='27'><li id='kverse-2-27'><i>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='28'><li id='kverse-2-28'><i>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='29'><li id='kverse-2-29'><i>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='30'><li id='kverse-2-30'><i>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-3-1'><i>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-3-3'><i>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-3-7'><i>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-3-8'><i>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</i>
