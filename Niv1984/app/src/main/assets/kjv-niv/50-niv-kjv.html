<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-62' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-63' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-64' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-67' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-68' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Yea doubtless, and I count all things </span><i>but</i><span> loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them </span><i>but</i><span> dung, that I may win Christ,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-69' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-71' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-72' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-73' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but </span><i>this</i><span> one thing </span><i>I do</i><span>, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-74' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-75' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-76' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-77' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-78' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, </span><i>that they are</i><span> the enemies of the cross of Christ:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[18] <span>For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span></div></div>
