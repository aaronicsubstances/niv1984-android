<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus </span><i>our</i><span> brother,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love </span><i>which ye have</i><span> to all the saints,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Which is come unto you, as </span><i>it is</i><span> in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as </span><i>it doth</i><span> also in you, since the day ye heard </span><i>of it</i><span>, and knew the grace of God in truth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard </span><i>it</i><span>, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated </span><i>us</i><span> into the kingdom of his dear Son:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, </span><i>even</i><span> the forgiveness of sins:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether </span><i>they be</i><span> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all </span><i>things</i><span> he might have the preeminence.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>For it pleased </span><i>the Father</i><span> that in him should all fulness dwell;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, </span><i>I say</i><span>, whether </span><i>they be</i><span> things in earth, or things in heaven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in </span><i>your</i><span> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and </span><i>be</i><span> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, </span><i>and</i><span> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'>[26] <i>Even</i><span> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>To whom God would make known what </span><i>is</i><span> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'>[28] <span>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'>[29] <span>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</span></div>

<h2 id='kjv-bookmark-32'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'>[1] <span>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and </span><i>for</i><span> them at Laodicea, and </span><i>for</i><span> as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'>[2] <span>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'>[3] <span>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'>[4] <span>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'>[5] <span>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'>[6] <span>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, </span><i>so</i><span> walk ye in him:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'>[7] <span>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'>[8] <span>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'>[9] <span>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'>[10] <span>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'>[11] <span>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'>[12] <span>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with </span><i>him</i><span> through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'>[13] <span>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'>[14] <span>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'>[15] <i>And</i><span> having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'>[16] <span>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath </span><i>days</i><span>:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'>[17] <span>Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body </span><i>is</i><span> of Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'>[18] <span>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'>[19] <span>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'>[20] <span>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[21] <span>(Touch not; taste not; handle not;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[22] <span>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[23] <span>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'>[13] <span>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also </span><i>do</i><span> ye.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-71'>[14] <span>And above all these things </span><i>put on</i><span> charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'>[15] <span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-73'>[16] <span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</span></div>
