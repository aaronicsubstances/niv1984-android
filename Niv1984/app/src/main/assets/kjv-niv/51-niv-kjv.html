<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and </span><i>for</i><span> them at Laodicea, and </span><i>for</i><span> as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, </span><i>so</i><span> walk ye in him:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <i>And</i><span> having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath </span><i>days</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body </span><i>is</i><span> of Christ.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules:</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"?</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>(Touch not; taste not; handle not;</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</span></div>
