<h3>1 Thessalonians 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</i>

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.

<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'><b>(NIV)</b> You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'><b>(NIV)</b> but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.

<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-2-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'><b>(NIV)</b> Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.

<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'><b>(NIV)</b> And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.

<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-2-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'><b>(NIV)</b> For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,
