<h3>1 Thessalonians 2</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'><b>(NIV)</b> You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'><b>(NIV)</b> We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-2-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'><b>(NIV)</b> but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-2-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'><b>(NIV)</b> We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-2-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'><b>(NIV)</b> Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'><b>(NIV)</b> You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-2-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'><b>(NIV)</b> For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-2-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'><b>(NIV)</b> encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-2-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'><b>(NIV)</b> And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-2-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'><b>(NIV)</b> For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-2-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-2-16'><b>(NIV)</b> in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-2-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'><b>(NIV)</b> But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-2-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-2-18'><b>(NIV)</b> For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, did, again and again--but Satan stopped us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-2-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'><b>(NIV)</b> For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
