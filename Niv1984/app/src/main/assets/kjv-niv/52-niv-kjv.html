<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians </span><i>which is</i><span> in God the Father and </span><i>in</i><span> the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace </span><i>be</i><span> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you,</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia--your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For our exhortation </span><i>was</i><span> not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God </span><i>is</i><span> witness:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor </span><i>yet</i><span> of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye </span><i>are</i><span> witnesses, and God </span><i>also</i><span>, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father </span><i>doth</i><span> his children,</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received </span><i>it</i><span> not </span><i>as</i><span> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they </span><i>have</i><span> of the Jews:</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, did, again and again--but Satan stopped us.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For what </span><i>is</i><span> our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? </span><i>Are</i><span> not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Indeed, you are our glory and joy.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also </span><i>to see</i><span> you:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all </span><i>men</i><span>, even as we </span><i>do</i><span> toward you:</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort </span><i>you</i><span> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, </span><i>so</i><span> ye would abound more and more.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this is the will of God, </span><i>even</i><span> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>that each of you should learn to control his own body </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup><span> in a way that is holy and honorable,</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That no </span><i>man</i><span> go beyond and defraud his brother in </span><i>any</i><span> matter: because that the Lord </span><i>is</i><span> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And in fact, you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and </span><i>that</i><span> ye may have lack of nothing.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive </span><i>and</i><span> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then we which are alive </span><i>and</i><span> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</span></div>
