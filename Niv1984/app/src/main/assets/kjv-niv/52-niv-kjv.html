<div id='verse-12' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-13' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For our exhortation </span><i>was</i><span> not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-14' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-15' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God </span><i>is</i><span> witness:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-16' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor </span><i>yet</i><span> of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-17' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-19' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-23' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received </span><i>it</i><span> not </span><i>as</i><span> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-24' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they </span><i>have</i><span> of the Jews:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[17] <span>But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-35' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.</span></div></div>
