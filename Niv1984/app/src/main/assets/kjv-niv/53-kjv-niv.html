</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'><b>(NIV)</b> not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</i>

<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'><b>(NIV)</b> He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</i>
