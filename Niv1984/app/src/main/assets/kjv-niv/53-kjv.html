<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <i>Which is</i><span> a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Seeing </span><i>it is</i><span> a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of </span><i>this</i><span> calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of </span><i>his</i><span> goodness, and the work of faith with power:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and </span><i>by</i><span> our gathering together unto him,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Let no man deceive you by any means: for </span><i>that day shall not come</i><span>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth </span><i>will let</i><span>, until he be taken out of the way.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given </span><i>us</i><span> everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all </span><i>men</i><span> have not faith.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Yet count </span><i>him</i><span> not as an enemy, but admonish </span><i>him</i><span> as a brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord </span><i>be</i><span> with you all.</span></div>
