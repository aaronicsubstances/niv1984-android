<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let no man deceive you by any means: for </span><i>that day shall not come</i><span>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Even him</i><span>, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all </span><i>men</i><span> have not faith.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep </span><i>you</i><span> from evil.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</span></div>
