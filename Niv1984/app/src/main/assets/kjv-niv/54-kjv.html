<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, </span><i>which is</i><span> our hope;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Unto Timothy, </span><i>my</i><span> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, </span><i>and</i><span> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: </span><i>so do</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and </span><i>of</i><span> a good conscience, and </span><i>of</i><span> faith unfeigned:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did </span><i>it</i><span> ignorantly in unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, </span><i>be</i><span> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
