<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, </span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, </span><i>which is</i><span> our hope;</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Unto Timothy, </span><i>my</i><span> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, </span><i>and</i><span> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work--which is by faith.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: </span><i>so do</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and </span><i>of</i><span> a good conscience, and </span><i>of</i><span> faith unfeigned:</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we know that the law </span><i>is</i><span> good, if a man use it lawfully;</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We also know that law </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did </span><i>it</i><span> ignorantly in unbelief.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, </span><i>be</i><span> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For kings, and </span><i>for</i><span> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is good, and pleases God our Savior,</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this </span><i>is</i><span> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>there is</i><span> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, </span><i>and</i><span> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But women </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> will be saved </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> he desires a noble task.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Likewise </span><i>must</i><span> the deacons </span><i>be</i><span> grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being </span><i>found</i><span> blameless.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the same way, their wives </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">2</a>]</sup><span> are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Even so </span><i>must their</i><span> wives </span><i>be</i><span> grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Forbidding to marry, </span><i>and commanding</i><span> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For every creature of God </span><i>is</i><span> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself </span><i>rather</i><span> unto godliness.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And withal they learn </span><i>to be</i><span> idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</span></div>
