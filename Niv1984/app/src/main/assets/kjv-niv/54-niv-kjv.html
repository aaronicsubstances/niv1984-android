<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work--which is by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-76'>Chapter 5</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'>[1] <span>Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-78'>[2] <span>older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[3] <span>Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[4] <span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-81'>[5] <span>The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[6] <span>But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[7] <span>Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-84'>[8] <span>If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[9] <span>No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-86'>[10] <span>and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'>[11] <span>As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-88'>[12] <span>Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[13] <span>Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-90'>[14] <span>So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-91'>[15] <span>Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-92'>[16] <span>If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-93'>[17] <span>The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-94'>[18] <span>For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">b</a>]</sup><span> and "The worker deserves his wages." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-95'>[19] <span>Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-96'>[20] <span>Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-97'>[21] <span>I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-98'>[22] <span>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-99'>[23] <span>Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[24] <span>The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-101'>[25] <span>In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.</span></div>
