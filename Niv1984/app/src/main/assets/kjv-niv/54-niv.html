<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work--which is by faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-77'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-87'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.</span></div>
