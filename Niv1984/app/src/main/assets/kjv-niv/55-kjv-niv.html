<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>But shun profane </span><i>and</i><span> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</span></div></div>
