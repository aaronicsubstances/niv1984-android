<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><i>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</i>
