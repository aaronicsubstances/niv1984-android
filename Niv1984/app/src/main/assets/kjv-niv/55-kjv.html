<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>To Timothy, </span><i>my</i><span> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, </span><i>and</i><span> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>I thank God, whom I serve from </span><i>my</i><span> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Who hath saved us, and called </span><i>us</i><span> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found </span><i>me</i><span>.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of </span><i>this</i><span> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>And if a man also strive for masteries, </span><i>yet</i><span> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, </span><i>even</i><span> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span></div>

<div>[11] <i>It is</i><span> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with </span><i>him</i><span>, we shall also live with </span><i>him</i><span>:</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with </span><i>him</i><span>: if we deny </span><i>him</i><span>, he also will deny us:</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>If we believe not, </span><i>yet</i><span> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Of these things put </span><i>them</i><span> in remembrance, charging </span><i>them</i><span> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, </span><i>but</i><span> to the subverting of the hearers.</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>But shun profane </span><i>and</i><span> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, </span><i>and</i><span> prepared unto every good work.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span></div>

<div>[23] <span>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</span></div>

<div>[24] <span>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all </span><i>men</i><span>, apt to teach, patient,</span></div>

<div>[25] <span>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</span></div>

<div>[26] <span>And </span><i>that</i><span> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all </span><i>men</i><span>, as theirs also was.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of </span><i>them</i><span> all the Lord delivered me.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned </span><i>them</i><span>;</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>All scripture </span><i>is</i><span> given by inspiration of God, and </span><i>is</i><span> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>I charge </span><i>thee</i><span> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>And they shall turn away </span><i>their</i><span> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished </span><i>my</i><span> course, I have kept the faith:</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring </span><i>with thee</i><span>, and the books, </span><i>but</i><span> especially the parchments.</span></div>

<div>[14] <span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</span></div>

<div>[15] <span>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</span></div>

<div>[16] <span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all </span><i>men</i><span> forsook me: </span><i>I pray God</i><span> that it may not be laid to their charge.</span></div>

<div>[17] <span>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and </span><i>that</i><span> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span></div>

<div>[18] <span>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve </span><i>me</i><span> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom </span><i>be</i><span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>

<div>[19] <span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</span></div>

<div>[20] <span>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</span></div>

<div>[21] <span>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</span></div>

<div>[22] <span>The Lord Jesus Christ </span><i>be</i><span> with thy spirit. Grace </span><i>be</i><span> with you. Amen.</span></div>
