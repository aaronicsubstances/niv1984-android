<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>Who hath saved us, and called </span><i>us</i><span> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found </span><i>me</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-21'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[1] <span>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[2] <span>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[3] <span>Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[4] <span>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[5] <span>Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[6] <span>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[7] <span>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[8] <span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[9] <span>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[10] <span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[11] <span>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[12] <span>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[13] <span>if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[14] <span>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[15] <span>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[16] <span>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[17] <span>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[18] <span>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[19] <span>Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[20] <span>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[21] <span>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[22] <span>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[23] <span>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[24] <span>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[25] <span>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[26] <span>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</span></div>
