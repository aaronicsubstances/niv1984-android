<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-21'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</span></div>
