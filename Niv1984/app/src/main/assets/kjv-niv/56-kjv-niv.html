<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> elders in every town, as I directed you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.</span></div></div>
