<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>One of themselves, </span><i>even</i><span> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians </span><i>are</i><span> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Unto the pure all things </span><i>are</i><span> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving </span><i>is</i><span> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny </span><i>him</i><span>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</span></div>
