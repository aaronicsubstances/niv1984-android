<h3>Titus 1</h3>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><i>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><i>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</i>
