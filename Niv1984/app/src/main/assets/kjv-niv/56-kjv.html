<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</i>
