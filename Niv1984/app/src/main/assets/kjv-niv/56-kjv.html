<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>To Titus, </span><i>mine</i><span> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, </span><i>and</i><span> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>One of themselves, </span><i>even</i><span> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians </span><i>are</i><span> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Unto the pure all things </span><i>are</i><span> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving </span><i>is</i><span> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny </span><i>him</i><span>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</span>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>The aged women likewise, that </span><i>they be</i><span> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<i>To be</i><span> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine </span><i>shewing</i><span> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<i>Exhort</i><span> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, </span><i>and</i><span> to please </span><i>them</i><span> well in all </span><i>things</i><span>; not answering again;</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</span>
</div>

<div id='chapter-3'>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, </span><i>but</i><span> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, </span><i>and</i><span> hating one another.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<i>This is</i><span> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace </span><i>be</i><span> with you all. Amen.</span>
