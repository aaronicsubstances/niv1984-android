<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> elders in every town, as I directed you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Since an overseer </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach--and that for the sake of dishonest gain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Even one of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-36'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Warn a divisive person once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. </span></div>
