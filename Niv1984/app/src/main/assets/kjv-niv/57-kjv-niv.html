<h3>Philemon 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'><b>(NIV)</b> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'><b>(NIV)</b> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'><b>(NIV)</b> yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_680420847_1">1</a>]</sup> who became my son while I was in chains.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'><b>(NIV)</b> I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'><b>(NIV)</b> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'><b>(NIV)</b> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'><b>(NIV)</b> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'><b>(NIV)</b> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'><b>(NIV)</b> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'><b>(NIV)</b> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'><b>(NIV)</b> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'><b>(NIV)</b> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'><b>(NIV)</b> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-1-22'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'><b>(NIV)</b> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-1-23'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'><b>(NIV)</b> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-1-24'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'><b>(NIV)</b> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-1-25'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</i>
