<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy </span><i>our</i><span> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>And to </span><i>our</i><span> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech </span><i>thee</i><span>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth </span><i>thee</i><span> ought, put that on mine account;</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>I Paul have written </span><i>it</i><span> with mine own hand, I will repay </span><i>it</i><span>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[21] <span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[22] <span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[23] <span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[24] <span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[25] <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ </span><i>be</i><span> with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>

<div class='fragment'>[25] <i>Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</i></div>
