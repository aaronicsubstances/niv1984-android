<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy </span><i>our</i><span> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>And to </span><i>our</i><span> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech </span><i>thee</i><span>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth </span><i>thee</i><span> ought, put that on mine account;</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>I Paul have written </span><i>it</i><span> with mine own hand, I will repay </span><i>it</i><span>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ </span><i>be</i><span> with your spirit. Amen.</span>
