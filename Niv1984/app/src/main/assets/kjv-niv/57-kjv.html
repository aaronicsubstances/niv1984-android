<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy </span><i>our</i><span> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>And to </span><i>our</i><span> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech </span><i>thee</i><span>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth </span><i>thee</i><span> ought, put that on mine account;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>I Paul have written </span><i>it</i><span> with mine own hand, I will repay </span><i>it</i><span>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ </span><i>be</i><span> with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
