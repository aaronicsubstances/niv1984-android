<h3>Philemon 1</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><i>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><i>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><i>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><i>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><i>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><i>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-1-22'><i>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-1-23'><i>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-1-24'><i>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-1-25'><i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</i>
