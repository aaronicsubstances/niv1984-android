<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-8' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-9' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech </span><i>thee</i><span>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-10' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, </span><sup>[<a href="#kjv-footnote-1-1" id="kjv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> who became my son while I was in chains.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-11' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-12' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-13' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-14' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-15' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[15] <span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-16' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-19' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>I Paul have written </span><i>it</i><span> with mine own hand, I will repay </span><i>it</i><span>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[19] <span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-20' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[20] <span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[21] <span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-22' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[22] <span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. </span></div></div>

<div id='verse-23' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[23] <span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span></div></div>
