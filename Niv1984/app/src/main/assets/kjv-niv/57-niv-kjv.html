<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy </span><i>our</i><span> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: </span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And to </span><i>our</i><span> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech </span><i>thee</i><span>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> who became my son while I was in chains.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth </span><i>thee</i><span> ought, put that on mine account;</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I Paul have written </span><i>it</i><span> with mine own hand, I will repay </span><i>it</i><span>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. </span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ </span><i>be</i><span> with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
