<h3>Philemon 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_680420847_1">1</a>]</sup> who became my son while I was in chains.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-1-16'>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='25'><li id='verse-1-25'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
</li></ol>
