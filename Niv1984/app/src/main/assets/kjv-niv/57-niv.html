<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: </span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> who became my son while I was in chains.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</span>
</div>

<div>[15]
<span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</span>
</div>

<div>[16]
<span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</span>
</div>

<div>[17]
<span>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</span>
</div>

<div>[18]
<span>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span>
</div>

<div>[19]
<span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</span>
</div>

<div>[20]
<span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span>
</div>

<div>[21]
<span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span>
</div>

<div>[22]
<span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. </span>
</div>

<div>[23]
<span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</span>
</div>

<div>[24]
<span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
</div>

<div>[25]
<span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span>
