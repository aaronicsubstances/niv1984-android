<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> who became my son while I was in chains.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span></div>
