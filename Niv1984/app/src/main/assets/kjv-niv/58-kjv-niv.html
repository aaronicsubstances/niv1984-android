<h3>Hebrews 4</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-4-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-4-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-4-2'><b>(NIV)</b> For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_1">1</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-4-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-4-3'><b>(NIV)</b> Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'" 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_2">2</a>]</sup> And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-4-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-4-4'><b>(NIV)</b> For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work."

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-4-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-4-5'><b>(NIV)</b> And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-4-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-4-6'><b>(NIV)</b> It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-4-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-4-7'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." 
<sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_4">4</a>]</sup>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-4-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-4-8'><b>(NIV)</b> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-4-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-4-9'><b>(NIV)</b> There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-4-10'><b>(NIV)</b> for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-4-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</i>
</li></ol>

<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-4-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-4-12'><b>(NIV)</b> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

<h3>Hebrews 5</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-5-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-5-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-5-2'><b>(NIV)</b> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-5-3'><b>(NIV)</b> This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-5-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</i>

<h3>Hebrews 10</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-10-1'><b>(NIV)</b> The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-10-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-10-2'><b>(NIV)</b> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-10-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-10-3'><b>(NIV)</b> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-10-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-10-4'><b>(NIV)</b> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-10-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-10-5'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-10-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-10-6'><b>(NIV)</b> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-10-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-10-8'><b>(NIV)</b> First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made).
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-10-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-10-9'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-10-10'><b>(NIV)</b> And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
