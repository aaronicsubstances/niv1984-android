<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by </span><i>his</i><span> Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Who being the brightness of </span><i>his</i><span> glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>But unto the Son </span><i>he saith</i><span>, Thy throne, O God, </span><i>is</i><span> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness </span><i>is</i><span> the sceptre of thy kingdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, </span><i>even</i><span> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let </span><i>them</i><span> slip.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard </span><i>him</i><span>;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>God also bearing </span><i>them</i><span> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For it became him, for whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, and by whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified </span><i>are</i><span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-29'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-31'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For verily he took not on </span><i>him the nature of</i><span> angels; but he took on </span><i>him</i><span> the seed of Abraham.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto </span><i>his</i><span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things </span><i>pertaining</i><span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses </span><i>was faithful</i><span> in all his house.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? </span><i>was it</i><span> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-68'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God </span><i>did</i><span> from his.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-69'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-70'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>For the word of God </span><i>is</i><span> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and </span><i>is</i><span> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-72'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast </span><i>our</i><span> profession.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-74'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span></div>
