<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by </span><i>his</i><span> Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>Who being the brightness of </span><i>his</i><span> glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>But unto the Son </span><i>he saith</i><span>, Thy throne, O God, </span><i>is</i><span> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness </span><i>is</i><span> the sceptre of thy kingdom.</span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, </span><i>even</i><span> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-15'>[1] <span>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let </span><i>them</i><span> slip.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[2] <span>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[3] <span>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard </span><i>him</i><span>;</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[4] <span>God also bearing </span><i>them</i><span> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[5] <span>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[6] <span>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span></div>

<div id='verse-21'>[7] <span>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[8] <span>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing </span><i>that is</i><span> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[9] <span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[10] <span>For it became him, for whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, and by whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[11] <span>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified </span><i>are</i><span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[12] <span>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[13] <span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[14] <span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[15] <span>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[16] <span>For verily he took not on </span><i>him the nature of</i><span> angels; but he took on </span><i>him</i><span> the seed of Abraham.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[17] <span>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto </span><i>his</i><span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things </span><i>pertaining</i><span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[18] <span>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-33'>[1] <span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[2] <span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses </span><i>was faithful</i><span> in all his house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[3] <span>For this </span><i>man</i><span> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[4] <span>For every house is builded by some </span><i>man</i><span>; but he that built all things </span><i>is</i><span> God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[5] <span>And Moses verily </span><i>was</i><span> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[6] <span>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[7] <span>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[8] <span>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[9] <span>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[10] <span>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in </span><i>their</i><span> heart; and they have not known my ways.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[11] <span>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[12] <span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[13] <span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[14] <span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[15] <span>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[16] <span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span></div>

<div id='verse-49'>[17] <span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? </span><i>was it</i><span> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span></div>

<div id='verse-50'>[18] <span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span></div>

<div id='verse-51'>[19] <span>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-4'>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-52'>[1] <span>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left </span><i>us</i><span> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-53'>[2] <span>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-54'>[3] <span>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span></div>

<div id='verse-55'>[4] <span>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh </span><i>day</i><span> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</span></div>

<div id='verse-56'>[5] <span>And in this </span><i>place</i><span> again, If they shall enter into my rest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[6] <span>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[7] <span>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span></div>

<div id='verse-59'>[8] <span>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</span></div>

<div id='verse-60'>[9] <span>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[10] <span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God </span><i>did</i><span> from his.</span></div>

<div id='verse-62'>[11] <span>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</span></div>

<div id='verse-63'>[12] <span>For the word of God </span><i>is</i><span> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and </span><i>is</i><span> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span></div>

<div id='verse-64'>[13] <span>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things </span><i>are</i><span> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</span></div>

<div id='verse-65'>[14] <span>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast </span><i>our</i><span> profession.</span></div>

<div id='verse-66'>[15] <span>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as </span><i>we are, yet</i><span> without sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-67'>[16] <span>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-5'>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-68'>[1] <span>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things </span><i>pertaining</i><span> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</span></div>

<div id='verse-69'>[2] <span>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</span></div>

<div id='verse-70'>[3] <span>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-71'>[4] <span>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as </span><i>was</i><span> Aaron.</span></div>

<div id='verse-72'>[5] <span>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-73'>[6] <span>As he saith also in another </span><i>place</i><span>, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>

<div id='verse-74'>[7] <span>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[8] <span>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[9] <span>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[10] <span>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>

<div id='verse-78'>[11] <span>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</span></div>

<div id='verse-79'>[12] <span>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which </span><i>be</i><span> the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-80'>[13] <span>For every one that useth milk </span><i>is</i><span> unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</span></div>

<div id='verse-81'>[14] <span>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, </span><i>even</i><span> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-82'>[1] <span>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-83'>[2] <span>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-84'>[3] <span>And this will we do, if God permit.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[4] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[5] <span>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[6] <span>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put </span><i>him</i><span> to an open shame.</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[7] <span>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[8] <span>But that which beareth thorns and briers </span><i>is</i><span> rejected, and </span><i>is</i><span> nigh unto cursing; whose end </span><i>is</i><span> to be burned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[9] <span>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[10] <span>For God </span><i>is</i><span> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</span></div>

<div id='verse-92'>[11] <span>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</span></div>

<div id='verse-93'>[12] <span>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</span></div>

<div id='verse-94'>[13] <span>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</span></div>

<div id='verse-95'>[14] <span>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</span></div>

<div id='verse-96'>[15] <span>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</span></div>

<div id='verse-97'>[16] <span>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation </span><i>is</i><span> to them an end of all strife.</span></div>

<div id='verse-98'>[17] <span>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed </span><i>it</i><span> by an oath:</span></div>

<div id='verse-99'>[18] <span>That by two immutable things, in which </span><i>it was</i><span> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[19] <span>Which </span><i>hope</i><span> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[20] <span>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, </span><i>even</i><span> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>

<div id='chapter-7'>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-102'>[1] <span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</span></div>

<div id='verse-103'>[2] <span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[3] <span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[4] <span>Now consider how great this man </span><i>was</i><span>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[5] <span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[6] <span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[7] <span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</span></div>

<div id='verse-109'>[8] <span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he </span><i>receiveth them</i><span>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-110'>[9] <span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</span></div>

<div id='verse-111'>[10] <span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-112'>[11] <span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need </span><i>was there</i><span> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span></div>

<div id='verse-113'>[12] <span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span></div>

<div id='verse-114'>[13] <span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</span></div>

<div id='verse-115'>[14] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-116'>[15] <span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</span></div>

<div id='verse-117'>[16] <span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-118'>[17] <span>For he testifieth, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>

<div id='verse-119'>[18] <span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</span></div>

<div id='verse-120'>[19] <span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope </span><i>did</i><span>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-121'>[20] <span>And inasmuch as not without an oath </span><i>he was made priest</i><span>:</span></div>

<div id='verse-122'>[21] <span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</span></div>

<div id='verse-123'>[22] <span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</span></div>

<div id='verse-124'>[23] <span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</span></div>

<div id='verse-125'>[24] <span>But this </span><i>man</i><span>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-126'>[25] <span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-127'>[26] <span>For such an high priest became us, </span><i>who is</i><span> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[27] <span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[28] <span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, </span><i>maketh</i><span> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-130'>[1] <span>Now of the things which we have spoken </span><i>this is</i><span> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</span></div>

<div id='verse-131'>[2] <span>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-132'>[3] <span>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore </span><i>it is</i><span> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</span></div>

<div id='verse-133'>[4] <span>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</span></div>

<div id='verse-134'>[5] <span>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, </span><i>that</i><span> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</span></div>

<div id='verse-135'>[6] <span>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[7] <span>For if that first </span><i>covenant</i><span> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[8] <span>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</span></div>

<div id='verse-138'>[9] <span>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span></div>

<div id='verse-139'>[10] <span>For this </span><i>is</i><span> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</span></div>

<div id='verse-140'>[11] <span>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-141'>[12] <span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-143'>[1] <span>Then verily the first </span><i>covenant</i><span> had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[2] <span>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein </span><i>was</i><span> the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[3] <span>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[4] <span>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein </span><i>was</i><span> the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[5] <span>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[6] <span>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service </span><i>of God</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-149'>[7] <span>But into the second </span><i>went</i><span> the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and </span><i>for</i><span> the errors of the people:</span></div>

<div id='verse-150'>[8] <span>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[9] <span>Which </span><i>was</i><span> a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[10] <i>Which stood</i><span> only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed </span><i>on them</i><span> until the time of reformation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-153'>[11] <span>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</span></div>

<div id='verse-154'>[12] <span>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption </span><i>for us</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-155'>[13] <span>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</span></div>

<div id='verse-156'>[14] <span>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[15] <span>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions </span><i>that were</i><span> under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-158'>[16] <span>For where a testament </span><i>is</i><span>, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</span></div>

<div id='verse-159'>[17] <span>For a testament </span><i>is</i><span> of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-160'>[18] <span>Whereupon neither the first </span><i>testament</i><span> was dedicated without blood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-161'>[19] <span>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span></div>

<div id='verse-162'>[20] <span>Saying, This </span><i>is</i><span> the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-163'>[21] <span>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-164'>[22] <span>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span></div>

<div id='verse-165'>[23] <i>It was</i><span> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[24] <span>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, </span><i>which are</i><span> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[25] <span>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[26] <span>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[27] <span>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[28] <span>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-171'>[1] <span>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, </span><i>and</i><span> not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</span></div>

<div id='verse-172'>[2] <span>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-173'>[3] <span>But in those </span><i>sacrifices there is</i><span> a remembrance again </span><i>made</i><span> of sins every year.</span></div>

<div id='verse-174'>[4] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</span></div>

<div id='verse-175'>[5] <span>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</span></div>

<div id='verse-176'>[6] <span>In burnt offerings and </span><i>sacrifices</i><span> for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</span></div>

<div id='verse-177'>[7] <span>Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-178'>[8] <span>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and </span><i>offering</i><span> for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure </span><i>therein</i><span>; which are offered by the law;</span></div>

<div id='verse-179'>[9] <span>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</span></div>

<div id='verse-180'>[10] <span>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once </span><i>for all</i><span>.</span></div>

<div id='verse-181'>[11] <span>And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</span></div>

<div id='verse-182'>[12] <span>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</span></div>

<div id='verse-183'>[13] <span>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</span></div>

<div id='verse-184'>[14] <span>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</span></div>

<div id='verse-185'>[15] <i>Whereof</i><span> the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</span></div>

<div id='verse-186'>[16] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</span></div>

<div id='verse-187'>[17] <span>And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</span></div>

<div id='verse-188'>[18] <span>Now where remission of these </span><i>is, there is</i><span> no more offering for sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-189'>[19] <span>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span></div>

<div id='verse-190'>[20] <span>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span></div>

<div id='verse-191'>[21] <span>And </span><i>having</i><span> an high priest over the house of God;</span></div>

<div id='verse-192'>[22] <span>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</span></div>

<div id='verse-193'>[23] <span>Let us hold fast the profession of </span><i>our</i><span> faith without wavering; (for he </span><i>is</i><span> faithful that promised;)</span></div>

<div id='verse-194'>[24] <span>And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[25] <span>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some </span><i>is</i><span>; but exhorting </span><i>one another</i><span>: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[26] <span>For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</span></div>

<div id='verse-197'>[27] <span>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</span></div>

<div id='verse-198'>[28] <span>He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</span></div>

<div id='verse-199'>[29] <span>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</span></div>

<div id='verse-200'>[30] <span>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance </span><i>belongeth</i><span> unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span></div>

<div id='verse-201'>[31] <i>It is</i><span> a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-202'>[32] <span>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</span></div>

<div id='verse-203'>[33] <span>Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[34] <span>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[35] <span>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-206'>[36] <span>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</span></div>

<div id='verse-207'>[37] <span>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[38] <span>Now the just shall live by faith: but if </span><i>any man</i><span> draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-210'>[1] <span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-211'>[2] <span>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</span></div>

<div id='verse-212'>[3] <span>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</span></div>

<div id='verse-213'>[4] <span>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</span></div>

<div id='verse-214'>[5] <span>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-215'>[6] <span>But without faith </span><i>it is</i><span> impossible to please </span><i>him</i><span>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and </span><i>that</i><span> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-216'>[7] <span>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span></div>

<div id='verse-217'>[8] <span>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</span></div>

<div id='verse-218'>[9] <span>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as </span><i>in</i><span> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</span></div>

<div id='verse-219'>[10] <span>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker </span><i>is</i><span> God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-220'>[11] <span>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span></div>

<div id='verse-221'>[12] <span>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, </span><i>so many</i><span> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</span></div>

<div id='verse-222'>[13] <span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of </span><i>them</i><span>, and embraced </span><i>them</i><span>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-223'>[14] <span>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span></div>

<div id='verse-224'>[15] <span>And truly, if they had been mindful of that </span><i>country</i><span> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-225'>[16] <span>But now they desire a better </span><i>country</i><span>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-226'>[17] <span>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten </span><i>son</i><span>,</span></div>

<div id='verse-227'>[18] <span>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span></div>

<div id='verse-228'>[19] <span>Accounting that God </span><i>was</i><span> able to raise </span><i>him</i><span> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</span></div>

<div id='verse-229'>[20] <span>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-230'>[21] <span>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, </span><i>leaning</i><span> upon the top of his staff.</span></div>

<div id='verse-231'>[22] <span>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span></div>

<div id='verse-232'>[23] <span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw </span><i>he was</i><span> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span></div>

<div id='verse-233'>[24] <span>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</span></div>

<div id='verse-234'>[25] <span>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</span></div>

<div id='verse-235'>[26] <span>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</span></div>

<div id='verse-236'>[27] <span>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span></div>

<div id='verse-237'>[28] <span>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-238'>[29] <span>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry </span><i>land</i><span>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</span></div>

<div id='verse-239'>[30] <span>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-240'>[31] <span>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</span></div>

<div id='verse-241'>[32] <span>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and </span><i>of</i><span> Barak, and </span><i>of</i><span> Samson, and </span><i>of</i><span> Jephthae; </span><i>of</i><span> David also, and Samuel, and </span><i>of</i><span> the prophets:</span></div>

<div id='verse-242'>[33] <span>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span></div>

<div id='verse-243'>[34] <span>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</span></div>

<div id='verse-244'>[35] <span>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</span></div>

<div id='verse-245'>[36] <span>And others had trial of </span><i>cruel</i><span> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</span></div>

<div id='verse-246'>[37] <span>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</span></div>

<div id='verse-247'>[38] <span>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and </span><i>in</i><span> mountains, and </span><i>in</i><span> dens and caves of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-248'>[39] <span>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</span></div>

<div id='verse-251'>[2] <span>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of </span><i>our</i><span> faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-252'>[3] <span>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span></div>

<div id='verse-253'>[4] <span>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</span></div>

<div id='verse-254'>[5] <span>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[6] <span>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-256'>[7] <span>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</span></div>

<div id='verse-257'>[8] <span>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span></div>

<div id='verse-258'>[9] <span>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected </span><i>us</i><span>, and we gave </span><i>them</i><span> reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span></div>

<div id='verse-259'>[10] <span>For they verily for a few days chastened </span><i>us</i><span> after their own pleasure; but he for </span><i>our</i><span> profit, that </span><i>we</i><span> might be partakers of his holiness.</span></div>

<div id='verse-260'>[11] <span>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</span></div>

<div id='verse-261'>[12] <span>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[13] <span>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-265'>[16] <span>Lest there </span><i>be</i><span> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[11] <span>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[12] <span>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[13] <span>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[14] <span>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[15] <span>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of </span><i>our</i><span> lips giving thanks to his name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[16] <span>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[17] <span>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that </span><i>is</i><span> unprofitable for you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-296'>[18] <span>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[19] <span>But I beseech </span><i>you</i><span> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[20] <span>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[21] <span>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom </span><i>be</i><span> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[22] <span>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[23] <span>Know ye that </span><i>our</i><span> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[24] <span>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-303'>[25] <span>Grace </span><i>be</i><span> with you all. Amen.</span></div>
