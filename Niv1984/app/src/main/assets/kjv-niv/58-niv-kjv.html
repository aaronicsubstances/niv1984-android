<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by </span><i>his</i><span> Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who being the brightness of </span><i>his</i><span> glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> " </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> ? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-4" id="niv-verse-1-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-5" id="niv-verse-1-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But unto the Son </span><i>he saith</i><span>, Thy throne, O God, </span><i>is</i><span> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness </span><i>is</i><span> the sceptre of thy kingdom.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-6" id="niv-verse-1-6">6</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, </span><i>even</i><span> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-7" id="niv-verse-1-7">7</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let </span><i>them</i><span> slip.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard </span><i>him</i><span>;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>God also bearing </span><i>them</i><span> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But there is a place where someone has testified: "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You made him a little </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and put everything under his feet." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing </span><i>that is</i><span> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For it became him, for whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, and by whom </span><i>are</i><span> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified </span><i>are</i><span> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And again, "I will put my trust in him." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup><span> And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For verily he took not on </span><i>him the nature of</i><span> angels; but he took on </span><i>him</i><span> the seed of Abraham.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-6" id="niv-verse-2-6">6</a>]</sup><span> the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto </span><i>his</i><span> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things </span><i>pertaining</i><span> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses </span><i>was faithful</i><span> in all his house.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this </span><i>man</i><span> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For every house is builded by some </span><i>man</i><span>; but he that built all things </span><i>is</i><span> God.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And Moses verily </span><i>was</i><span> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, `Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in </span><i>their</i><span> heart; and they have not known my ways.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? </span><i>was it</i><span> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-3" id="niv-verse-3-3">3</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left </span><i>us</i><span> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard </span><i>it</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup><span> And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-3" id="niv-verse-4-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh </span><i>day</i><span> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And in this </span><i>place</i><span> again, If they shall enter into my rest.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-4" id="niv-verse-4-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God </span><i>did</i><span> from his.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the word of God </span><i>is</i><span> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and </span><i>is</i><span> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things </span><i>are</i><span> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things </span><i>pertaining</i><span> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as </span><i>was</i><span> Aaron.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">1</a>]</sup><span> " </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-2" id="niv-verse-5-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-3" id="niv-verse-5-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As he saith also in another </span><i>place</i><span>, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which </span><i>be</i><span> the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For every one that useth milk </span><i>is</i><span> unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, </span><i>even</i><span> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now consider how great this man </span><i>was</i><span>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he </span><i>receiveth them</i><span>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need </span><i>was there</i><span> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-1" id="niv-verse-7-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he testifieth, Thou </span><i>art</i><span> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope </span><i>did</i><span>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And inasmuch as not without an oath </span><i>he was made priest</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: `You are a priest forever.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-7-2" id="niv-verse-7-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But this </span><i>man</i><span>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For such an high priest became us, </span><i>who is</i><span> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, </span><i>maketh</i><span> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then verily the first </span><i>covenant</i><span> had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein </span><i>was</i><span> the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein </span><i>was</i><span> the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-1" id="niv-verse-9-1">1</a>]</sup><span> But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service </span><i>of God</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But into the second </span><i>went</i><span> the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and </span><i>for</i><span> the errors of the people:</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Which </span><i>was</i><span> a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Which stood</i><span> only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed </span><i>on them</i><span> until the time of reformation.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-2" id="niv-verse-9-2">2</a>]</sup><span> he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption </span><i>for us</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-3" id="niv-verse-9-3">3</a>]</sup><span> so that we may serve the living God!</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions </span><i>that were</i><span> under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the case of a will, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-4" id="niv-verse-9-4">4</a>]</sup><span> it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For where a testament </span><i>is</i><span>, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For a testament </span><i>is</i><span> of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whereupon neither the first </span><i>testament</i><span> was dedicated without blood.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-9-5" id="niv-verse-9-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Saying, This </span><i>is</i><span> the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <i>It was</i><span> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, </span><i>which are</i><span> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, </span><i>and</i><span> not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But in those </span><i>sacrifices there is</i><span> a remembrance again </span><i>made</i><span> of sins every year.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>In burnt offerings and </span><i>sacrifices</i><span> for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then I said, `Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll-- I have come to do your will, O God.'" </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-1" id="niv-verse-10-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made).</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and </span><i>offering</i><span> for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure </span><i>therein</i><span>; which are offered by the law;</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once </span><i>for all</i><span>.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool,</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <i>Whereof</i><span> the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>"This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-2" id="niv-verse-10-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This </span><i>is</i><span> the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-3" id="niv-verse-10-3">3</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now where remission of these </span><i>is, there is</i><span> no more offering for sin.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,</span></div>
<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And </span><i>having</i><span> an high priest over the house of God;</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.</span></div>
<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let us hold fast the profession of </span><i>our</i><span> faith without wavering; (for he </span><i>is</i><span> faithful that promised;)</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some </span><i>is</i><span>; but exhorting </span><i>one another</i><span>: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>NIV</b>] <span>How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span></div>
<div>[29 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</span></div>
<div>[30 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-4" id="niv-verse-10-4">4</a>]</sup><span> and again, "The Lord will judge his people." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-5" id="niv-verse-10-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[30 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance </span><i>belongeth</i><span> unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></div>
<div>[31 <b>KJV</b>] <i>It is</i><span> a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.</span></div>
<div>[32 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.</span></div>
<div>[33 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.</span></div>
<div>[34 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.</span></div>
<div>[35 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.</span></div>
<div>[36 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For in just a very little while, "He who is coming will come and will not delay.</span></div>
<div>[37 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</span></div>
<div>[38 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But my righteous one </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-6" id="niv-verse-10-6">6</a>]</sup><span> will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-10-7" id="niv-verse-10-7">7</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[38 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now the just shall live by faith: but if </span><i>any man</i><span> draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</span></div>
<div>[39 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.</span></div>
<div>[39 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But without faith </span><i>it is</i><span> impossible to please </span><i>him</i><span>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and </span><i>that</i><span> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten </span><i>son</i><span>,</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset </span><i>us</i><span>, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of </span><i>our</i><span> faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-1" id="niv-verse-12-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live!</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected </span><i>us</i><span>, and we gave </span><i>them</i><span> reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For they verily for a few days chastened </span><i>us</i><span> after their own pleasure; but he for </span><i>our</i><span> profit, that </span><i>we</i><span> might be partakers of his holiness.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Follow peace with all </span><i>men</i><span>, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble </span><i>you</i><span>, and thereby many be defiled;</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Lest there </span><i>be</i><span> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which </span><i>voice</i><span> they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</span></div>
<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-4" id="niv-verse-12-4">4</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And so terrible was the sight, </span><i>that</i><span> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</span></div>
<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.</span></div>
<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than </span><i>that of</i><span> Abel.</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?</span></div>
<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more </span><i>shall not</i><span> we </span><i>escape</i><span>, if we turn away from him that </span><i>speaketh</i><span> from heaven:</span></div>
<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-12-5" id="niv-verse-12-5">5</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The words "once more" indicate the removing of what can be shaken--that is, created things--so that what cannot be shaken may remain.</span></div>
<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And this </span><i>word</i><span>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,</span></div>
<div>[28 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</span></div>
