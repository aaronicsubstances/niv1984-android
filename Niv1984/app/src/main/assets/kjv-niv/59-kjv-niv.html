<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'><b>(NIV)</b> because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'><b>(NIV)</b> Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'><b>(NIV)</b> For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'><b>(NIV)</b> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.

<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-1-14'><b>(NIV)</b> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-1-15'><b>(NIV)</b> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-1-17'><b>(NIV)</b> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-1-18'><b>(NIV)</b> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.

<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'><b>(NIV)</b> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'><b>(NIV)</b> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-1-22'><b>(NIV)</b> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-1-22'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-1-23'><b>(NIV)</b> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-1-23'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i>

<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-1-24'><b>(NIV)</b> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='26'><li id='verse-1-26'><b>(NIV)</b> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.

<h3>James 2</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'><b>(NIV)</b> My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.

<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'><b>(NIV)</b> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
