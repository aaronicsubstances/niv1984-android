<h3>James 1</h3>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><i>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-1-15'><i>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-1-16'><i>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-1-17'><i>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><i>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><i>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-1-21'><i>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-1-22'><i>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-1-23'><i>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-1-24'><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-1-25'><i>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-1-26'><i>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='27'><li id='kverse-1-27'><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i>

<h3>James 2</h3>
<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-2-1'><i>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-2-2'><i>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-2-3'><i>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-2-4'><i>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-2-5'><i>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-2-6'><i>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-2-7'><i>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-2-8'><i>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-2-9'><i>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-2-10'><i>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-2-11'><i>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-2-12'><i>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-2-13'><i>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-2-14'><i>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='15'><li id='kverse-2-15'><i>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='16'><li id='kverse-2-16'><i>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='17'><li id='kverse-2-17'><i>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-2-18'><i>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-2-19'><i>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-2-20'><i>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='21'><li id='kverse-2-21'><i>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='22'><li id='kverse-2-22'><i>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='23'><li id='kverse-2-23'><i>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='24'><li id='kverse-2-24'><i>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='25'><li id='kverse-2-25'><i>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='26'><li id='kverse-2-26'><i>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-3-2'><i>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</i>

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-3-6'><i>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-3-7'><i>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</i>
