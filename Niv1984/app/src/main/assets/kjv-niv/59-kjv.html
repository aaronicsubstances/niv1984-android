<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Knowing </span><i>this</i><span>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>But let patience have </span><i>her</i><span> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all </span><i>men</i><span> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>A double minded man </span><i>is</i><span> unstable in all his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth </span><i>therein</i><span>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion </span><i>is</i><span> vain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, </span><i>and</i><span> to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one </span><i>point</i><span>, he is guilty of all.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What </span><i>doth it</i><span> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent </span><i>them</i><span> out another way?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span></div>
