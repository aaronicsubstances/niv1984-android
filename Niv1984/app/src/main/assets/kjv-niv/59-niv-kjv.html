<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. </span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Knowing </span><i>this</i><span>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But let patience have </span><i>her</i><span> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all </span><i>men</i><span> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>A double minded man </span><i>is</i><span> unstable in all his ways.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Blessed </span><i>is</i><span> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth </span><i>therein</i><span>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion </span><i>is</i><span> vain.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</span></div>

<div>[27 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, </span><i>and</i><span> to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span><i>the Lord</i><span> of glory, with respect of persons.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">1</a>]</sup><span> you are doing right.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one </span><i>point</i><span>, he is guilty of all.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">2</a>]</sup><span> also said, "Do not murder." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">3</a>]</sup><span> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>What </span><i>doth it</i><span> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be </span><i>ye</i><span> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what </span><i>doth it</i><span> profit?</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">4</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">5</a>]</sup><span> and he was called God's friend.</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.</span></div>

<div>[24 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>NIV</b>] <span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</span></div>

<div>[25 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent </span><i>them</i><span> out another way?</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</span></div>

<div>[26 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same </span><i>is</i><span> a perfect man, </span><i>and</i><span> able also to bridle the whole body.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Behold also the ships, which though </span><i>they be</i><span> so great, and </span><i>are</i><span> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the tongue </span><i>is</i><span> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the tongue can no man tame; </span><i>it is</i><span> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.</span></div>

<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Can both fresh water and salt </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">1</a>]</sup><span> water flow from the same spring?</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet </span><i>water</i><span> and bitter?</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</span></div>

<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Such "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but </span><i>is</i><span> earthly, sensual, devilish.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For where envying and strife </span><i>is</i><span>, there </span><i>is</i><span> confusion and every evil work.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, </span><i>and</i><span> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>From whence </span><i>come</i><span> wars and fightings among you? </span><i>come they</i><span> not hence, </span><i>even</i><span> of your lusts that war in your members?</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God.</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume </span><i>it</i><span> upon your lusts.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-2" id="niv-verse-4-2">2</a>]</sup> </div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span></div>
