<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'><span class='verse-num'>[27]</span> <span>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> you are doing right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> also said, "Do not murder." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and he was called God's friend.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'><span class='verse-num'>[25]</span> <span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'><span class='verse-num'>[26]</span> <span>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check.</span></div>
