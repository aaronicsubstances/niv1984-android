<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'>[22] <span>Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'>[23] <span>Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[24] <span>and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[25] <span>But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[26] <span>If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[27] <span>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-30'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[1] <span>My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[2] <span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[3] <span>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[4] <span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[5] <span>Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[6] <span>But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[7] <span>Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[8] <span>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> you are doing right.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[9] <span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[10] <span>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[11] <span>For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> also said, "Do not murder." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup><span> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[12] <span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[13] <span>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[14] <span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[15] <span>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-46'>[16] <span>If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-47'>[17] <span>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-48'>[18] <span>But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[19] <span>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[20] <span>You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> ?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[21] <span>Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[22] <span>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[23] <span>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup><span> and he was called God's friend.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[24] <span>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[25] <span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[26] <span>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[1] <span>Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[2] <span>We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[3] <span>When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[4] <span>Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[5] <span>Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[6] <span>The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[7] <span>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[8] <span>but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-67'>[9] <span>With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-68'>[10] <span>Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-69'>[11] <span>Can both fresh water and salt </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup><span> water flow from the same spring?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-70'>[12] <span>My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-71'>[13] <span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-72'>[14] <span>But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-73'>[15] <span>Such "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-74'>[16] <span>For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-75'>[17] <span>But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-79'>[1] <span>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-80'>[2] <span>You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-82'>[4] <span>You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-83'>[5] <span>Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely? </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-85'>[7] <span>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-89'>[11] <span>Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-100'>[3] <span>Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-111'>[14] <span>Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-112'>[15] <span>And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-113'>[16] <span>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-114'>[17] <span>Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-115'>[18] <span>Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.</span></div>
