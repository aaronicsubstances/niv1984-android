<h3>1 Peter 4</h3>
<ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-4-1'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.

<ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-4-1'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</i>
