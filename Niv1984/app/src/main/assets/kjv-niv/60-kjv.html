<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Blessed </span><i>be</i><span> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see </span><i>him</i><span> not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace </span><i>that should come</i><span> unto you:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, </span><i>as</i><span> silver and gold, from your vain conversation </span><i>received</i><span> by tradition from your fathers;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, </span><i>see that ye</i><span> love one another with a pure heart fervently:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For all flesh </span><i>is</i><span> as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-30'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-37'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>But ye </span><i>are</i><span> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>As free, and not using </span><i>your</i><span> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-47'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>For this </span><i>is</i><span> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-49'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-50'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-51'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed </span><i>himself</i><span> to him that judgeth righteously:</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</span></div>
