<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Likewise, ye wives, </span><i>be</i><span> in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>While they behold your chaste conversation </span><i>coupled</i><span> with fear.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whose adorning let it not be that outward </span><i>adorning</i><span> of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But </span><i>let it be</i><span> the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, </span><i>even the ornament</i><span> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands,</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.</span></div>

<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Finally, </span><i>be ye</i><span> all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, </span><i>be</i><span> pitiful, </span><i>be</i><span> courteous:</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and </span><i>be</i><span> ready always to </span><i>give</i><span> an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For </span><i>it is</i><span> better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>through whom </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-4" id="niv-verse-3-4">4</a>]</sup><span> also he went and preached to the spirits in prison</span></div>

<div>[21 <b>NIV</b>] <span>and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-5" id="niv-verse-3-5">5</a>]</sup><span> of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.</span></div>
<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>That he no longer should live the rest of </span><i>his</i><span> time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do--living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the time past of </span><i>our</i><span> life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with </span><i>them</i><span> to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of </span><i>you</i><span>:</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.</span></div>
<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>NIV</b>] <span>The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.</span></div>
<div>[7 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.</span></div>
<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.</span></div>
<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>As every man hath received the gift, </span><i>even so</i><span> minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If any man speak, </span><i>let him speak</i><span> as the oracles of God; if any man minister, </span><i>let him do it</i><span> as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.</span></div>
<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.</span></div>
<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</span></div>
<div>[14 <b>KJV</b>] <span>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy </span><i>are ye</i><span>; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>NIV</b>] <span>If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.</span></div>
<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or </span><i>as</i><span> a thief, or </span><i>as</i><span> an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.</span></div>
<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Yet if </span><i>any man suffer</i><span> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</span></div>
<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For the time </span><i>is come</i><span> that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if </span><i>it</i><span> first </span><i>begin</i><span> at us, what shall the end </span><i>be</i><span> of them that obey not the gospel of God?</span></div>
<div>[18 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"</span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>NIV</b>] <span>So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.</span></div>
<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls </span><i>to him</i><span> in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;</span></div>
<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight </span><i>thereof</i><span>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.</span></div>
<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Neither as being lords over </span><i>God's</i><span> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.</span></div>
<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span></div>
<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">1</a>]</sup> </div>
<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all </span><i>of you</i><span> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span></div>

<div>[8 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.</span></div>
<div>[9 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span></div>
