<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'><span class='verse-num'>[1]</span> <span>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'><span class='verse-num'>[2]</span> <span>who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'><span class='verse-num'>[7]</span> <span>These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'><span class='verse-num'>[8]</span> <span>Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'><span class='verse-num'>[9]</span> <span>for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'><span class='verse-num'>[10]</span> <span>Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'><span class='verse-num'>[11]</span> <span>trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'><span class='verse-num'>[12]</span> <span>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'><span class='verse-num'>[13]</span> <span>Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'><span class='verse-num'>[14]</span> <span>As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'><span class='verse-num'>[18]</span> <span>For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'><span class='verse-num'>[19]</span> <span>but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'><span class='verse-num'>[20]</span> <span>He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'><span class='verse-num'>[21]</span> <span>Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-23'><span class='verse-num'>[22]</span> <span>Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-24'><span class='verse-num'>[23]</span> <span>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>For, "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'><span class='verse-num'>[6]</span> <span>For in Scripture it says: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'><span class='verse-num'>[15]</span> <span>For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'><span class='verse-num'>[16]</span> <span>Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'><span class='verse-num'>[17]</span> <span>Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'><span class='verse-num'>[24]</span> <span>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'><span class='verse-num'>[3]</span> <span>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'><span class='verse-num'>[4]</span> <span>Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'><span class='verse-num'>[5]</span> <span>For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands,</span></div>
