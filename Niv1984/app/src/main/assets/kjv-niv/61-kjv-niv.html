<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'><b>(NIV)</b> Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'><b>(NIV)</b> For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>

<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'><b>(NIV)</b> Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'><b>(NIV)</b> I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,

<ol class='kjv' start='18'><li id='kverse-1-18'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-1-19'><b>(NIV)</b> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

<ol class='kjv' start='19'><li id='kverse-1-19'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-1-20'><b>(NIV)</b> Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='20'><li id='kverse-1-20'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-1-21'><b>(NIV)</b> For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
