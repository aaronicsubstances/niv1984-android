<h2 id='niv-bookmark-1'>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-2'>[1] <span>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-3'>[2] <span>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-4'>[3] <span>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that </span><i>pertain</i><span> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-5'>[4] <span>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-6'>[5] <span>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-7'>[6] <span>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-8'>[7] <span>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-9'>[8] <span>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make </span><i>you that ye shall</i><span> neither </span><i>be</i><span> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-10'>[9] <span>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-11'>[10] <span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-12'>[11] <span>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-13'>[12] <span>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know </span><i>them</i><span>, and be established in the present truth.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-14'>[13] <span>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting </span><i>you</i><span> in remembrance;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-15'>[14] <span>Knowing that shortly I must put off </span><i>this</i><span> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-16'>[15] <span>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-17'>[16] <span>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-18'>[17] <span>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-19'>[18] <span>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-20'>[19] <span>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-21'>[20] <span>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-22'>[21] <span>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake </span><i>as they were</i><span> moved by the Holy Ghost.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-24'>Chapter 2</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-25'>[1] <span>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-26'>[2] <span>Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-27'>[3] <span>In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-28'>[4] <span>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> putting them into gloomy dungeons </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> to be held for judgment;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-29'>[5] <span>if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-30'>[6] <span>if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-31'>[7] <span>and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-32'>[8] <span>(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-33'>[9] <span>if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-3" id="niv-verse-2-3">c</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-34'>[10] <span>This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-4" id="niv-verse-2-4">d</a>]</sup><span> and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-35'>[11] <span>yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-36'>[12] <span>But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-37'>[13] <span>They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-5" id="niv-verse-2-5">e</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-38'>[14] <span>With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed--an accursed brood!</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-39'>[15] <span>They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-40'>[16] <span>But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast without speech--who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-41'>[17] <span>These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-42'>[18] <span>For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-43'>[19] <span>They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity--for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-44'>[20] <span>If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-45'>[21] <span>It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.</span></div>

<h2 id='niv-bookmark-48'>Chapter 3</h2>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-49'>[1] <span>Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-50'>[2] <span>I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-51'>[3] <span>First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-52'>[4] <span>They will say, "Where is this `coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-53'>[5] <span>But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-54'>[6] <span>By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-55'>[7] <span>By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-56'>[8] <span>But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-57'>[9] <span>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-58'>[10] <span>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-1" id="niv-verse-3-1">a</a>]</sup> </div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-59'>[11] <span>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-60'>[12] <span>as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-3-2" id="niv-verse-3-2">b</a>]</sup><span> That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-61'>[13] <span>But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-62'>[14] <span>So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-63'>[15] <span>Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-64'>[16] <span>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-65'>[17] <span>Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='niv-bookmark-66'>[18] <span>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen. </span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-53'>[5] <span>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-54'>[6] <span>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-55'>[7] <span>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</span></div>

<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-57'>[9] <span>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-58'>[10] <span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-59'>[11] <i>Seeing</i><span> then </span><i>that</i><span> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner </span><i>of persons</i><span> ought ye to be in </span><i>all</i><span> holy conversation and godliness,</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-60'>[12] <span>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-61'>[13] <span>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-62'>[14] <span>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-63'>[15] <span>And account </span><i>that</i><span> the longsuffering of our Lord </span><i>is</i><span> salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-64'>[16] <span>As also in all </span><i>his</i><span> epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as </span><i>they do</i><span> also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-65'>[17] <span>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know </span><i>these things</i><span> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</span></div>
<div class='verse' id='kjv-bookmark-66'>[18] <span>But grow in grace, and </span><i>in</i><span> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him </span><i>be</i><span> glory both now and for ever. Amen.</span></div>
