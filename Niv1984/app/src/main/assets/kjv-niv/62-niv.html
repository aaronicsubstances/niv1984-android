<h3>1 John 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.

<h3>1 John 2</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-2-1'>My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for

<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'>We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>The man who says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-2-12'>I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.

<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-2-17'>The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.
</li></ol>

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-2-19'>They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-2-22'>Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-2-23'>No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='24'><li id='verse-2-24'>See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='28'><li id='verse-2-28'>And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.

<h3>1 John 3</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-3-1'>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-3-2'>Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears,

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-3-6'>No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-3-7'>Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-3-8'>He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.

<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-3-9'>No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
