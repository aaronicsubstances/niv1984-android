<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1] <span>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</span></div>

<div>[2] <span>For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</span></div>

<div>[3] <span>Grace be with you, mercy, </span><i>and</i><span> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span></div>

<div>[4] <span>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span></div>

<div>[5] <span>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span></div>

<div>[6] <span>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</span></div>

<div>[7] <span>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span></div>

<div>[8] <span>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</span></div>

<div>[9] <span>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</span></div>

<div>[10] <span>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into </span><i>your</i><span> house, neither bid him God speed:</span></div>

<div>[11] <span>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</span></div>

<div>[12] <span>Having many things to write unto you, I would not </span><i>write</i><span> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</span></div>

<div>[13] <span>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</span></div>
