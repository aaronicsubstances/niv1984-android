<h3>2 John 1</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</i>

</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</i>
