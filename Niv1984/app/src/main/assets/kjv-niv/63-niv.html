<h3>2 John 1</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-1-1'>The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-1-2'>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-1-3'>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-1-4'>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-1-5'>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-1-9'>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-1-10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-1-12'>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-1-13'>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.
