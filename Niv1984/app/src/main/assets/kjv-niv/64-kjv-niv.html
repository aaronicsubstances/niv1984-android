</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-1-6'><b>(NIV)</b> They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.

<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-1-7'><b>(NIV)</b> It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-1-8'><b>(NIV)</b> We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.

<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><b><i>(KJV)</i></b> <i>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-1-11'><b>(NIV)</b> Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
