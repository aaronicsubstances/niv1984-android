<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[1] <span>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[2] <span>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will have nothing to do with us.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth </span><i>them</i><span> out of the church.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone--and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>Demetrius hath good report of all </span><i>men</i><span>, and of the truth itself: yea, and we </span><i>also</i><span> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name. </span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[14] <span>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace </span><i>be</i><span> to thee. </span><i>Our</i><span> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</span></div></div>
