<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>[1]
<span>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[2]
<span>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span>
</div>

<div>[3]
<span>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[4]
<span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[5]
<span>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</span>
</div>

<div>[6]
<span>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</span>
</div>

<div>[7]
<span>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span>
</div>

<div>[8]
<span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</span>
</div>

<div>[9]
<span>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span>
</div>

<div>[10]
<span>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth </span><i>them</i><span> out of the church.</span>
</div>

<div>[11]
<span>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span>
</div>

<div>[12]
<span>Demetrius hath good report of all </span><i>men</i><span>, and of the truth itself: yea, and we </span><i>also</i><span> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</span>
</div>

<div>[13]
<span>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</span>
</div>

<div>[14]
<span>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace </span><i>be</i><span> to thee. </span><i>Our</i><span> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</span>
