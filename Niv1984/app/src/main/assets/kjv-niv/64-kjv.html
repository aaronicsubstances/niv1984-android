<h3>3 John 1</h3><ol class='kjv' start='1'><li id='kverse-1-1'><i>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='2'><li id='kverse-1-2'><i>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='3'><li id='kverse-1-3'><i>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='4'><li id='kverse-1-4'><i>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='5'><li id='kverse-1-5'><i>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='6'><li id='kverse-1-6'><i>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='7'><li id='kverse-1-7'><i>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='8'><li id='kverse-1-8'><i>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='9'><li id='kverse-1-9'><i>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='10'><li id='kverse-1-10'><i>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='11'><li id='kverse-1-11'><i>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='12'><li id='kverse-1-12'><i>Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='13'><li id='kverse-1-13'><i>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</i>
</li></ol>
<ol class='kjv' start='14'><li id='kverse-1-14'><i>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</i>
