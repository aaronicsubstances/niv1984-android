<div id='verse-3' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort </span><i>you</i><span> that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[3] <span>Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-4' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[4] <span>For certain men whose condemnation was written about </span><sup>[<a href="#kjv-footnote-1-2" id="kjv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-5' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[5] <span>Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord </span><sup>[<a href="#kjv-footnote-1-3" id="kjv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-6' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[6] <span>And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home--these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-7' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[7] <span>In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-8' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>Likewise also these </span><i>filthy</i><span> dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[8] <span>In the very same way, these dreamers pollute their own bodies, reject authority and slander celestial beings.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-9' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[9] <span>But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-10' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[10] <span>Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand; and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals--these are the very things that destroy them.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-11' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[11] <span>Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-12' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds </span><i>they are</i><span> without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[12] <span>These men are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-13' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[13] <span>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</span></div></div>

<div id='verse-16' class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling </span><i>words</i><span>, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.</span></div></div>

<div class="flex-item"><div class="flex-item-inner">[16] <span>These men are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.</span></div></div>
