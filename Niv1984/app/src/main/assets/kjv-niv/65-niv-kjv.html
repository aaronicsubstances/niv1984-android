<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div>[1 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">1</a>]</sup><span> Jesus Christ: </span></div>

<div>[1 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, </span><i>and</i><span> called:</span></div>

<div>[2 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. </span></div>

<div>[2 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.</span></div>

<div>[3 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort </span><i>you</i><span> that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>NIV</b>] <span>For certain men whose condemnation was written about </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">2</a>]</sup><span> long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.</span></div>

<div>[4 <b>KJV</b>] <span>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">3</a>]</sup><span> delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.</span></div>

<div>[5 <b>KJV</b>] <span>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>NIV</b>] <span>And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home--these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.</span></div>

<div>[6 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</span></div>

<div>[10 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>NIV</b>] <span>Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.</span></div>

<div>[11 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>NIV</b>] <span>These men are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead.</span></div>

<div>[12 <b>KJV</b>] <span>These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds </span><i>they are</i><span> without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>NIV</b>] <span>They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.</span></div>

<div>[13 <b>KJV</b>] <span>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</span></div>

<div>[15 <b>KJV</b>] <span>To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard </span><i>speeches</i><span> which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>NIV</b>] <span>These men are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.</span></div>

<div>[16 <b>KJV</b>] <span>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling </span><i>words</i><span>, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>NIV</b>] <span>But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.</span></div>

<div>[17 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span></div>

<div>[18 <b>KJV</b>] <span>How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</span></div>

<div>[19 <b>KJV</b>] <span>These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</span></div>

<div>[20 <b>KJV</b>] <span>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</span></div>

<div>[22 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And of some have compassion, making a difference:</span></div>

<div>[23 <b>KJV</b>] <span>And others save with fear, pulling </span><i>them</i><span> out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</span></div>
