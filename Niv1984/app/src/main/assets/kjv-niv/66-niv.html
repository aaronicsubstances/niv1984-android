</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-2-2'>I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-2-3'>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-2-4'>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-2-5'>Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-2-6'>But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-2-7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-2-8'>"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-2-9'>I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-2-10'>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-2-11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-2-13'>I know where you live--where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city--where Satan lives.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-2-14'>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-2-15'>Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-2-20'>Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-2-21'>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
</li></ol>

<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-20-2'>He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-20-3'>He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-20-4'>I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-20-5'>(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-20-6'>Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='7'><li id='verse-20-7'>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-20-8'>and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth--Gog and Magog--to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-20-9'>They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-20-10'>And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-20-11'>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-20-12'>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-20-13'>The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-20-14'>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-20-15'>If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

<h3>Revelation 21</h3><ol class='niv' start='1'><li id='verse-21-1'>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='2'><li id='verse-21-2'>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='3'><li id='verse-21-3'>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='4'><li id='verse-21-4'>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='5'><li id='verse-21-5'>He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='6'><li id='verse-21-6'>He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.

<ol class='niv' start='8'><li id='verse-21-8'>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='9'><li id='verse-21-9'>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='10'><li id='verse-21-10'>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='11'><li id='verse-21-11'>It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='12'><li id='verse-21-12'>It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='13'><li id='verse-21-13'>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='14'><li id='verse-21-14'>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='15'><li id='verse-21-15'>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='16'><li id='verse-21-16'>The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='17'><li id='verse-21-17'>He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='18'><li id='verse-21-18'>The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='19'><li id='verse-21-19'>The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

<ol class='niv' start='20'><li id='verse-21-20'>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.

</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='21'><li id='verse-21-21'>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.

<ol class='niv' start='22'><li id='verse-21-22'>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
</li></ol>
<ol class='niv' start='23'><li id='verse-21-23'>The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
