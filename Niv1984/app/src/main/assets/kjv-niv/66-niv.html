<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-1'>[1] <span>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,</span></div>

<div id='verse-2'>[2] <span>who testifies to everything he saw--that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span></div>

<div id='verse-3'>[3] <span>Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near. </span></div>

<div id='verse-4'>[4] <span>John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-1" id="niv-verse-1-1">a</a>]</sup><span> before his throne,</span></div>

<div id='verse-5'>[5] <span>and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,</span></div>

<div id='verse-6'>[6] <span>and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen. </span></div>

<div id='verse-7'>[7] <span>Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.</span></div>

<div id='verse-8'>[8] <span>"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty." </span></div>

<div id='verse-9'>[9] <span>I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-10'>[10] <span>On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,</span></div>

<div id='verse-11'>[11] <span>which said: "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."</span></div>

<div id='verse-12'>[12] <span>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</span></div>

<div id='verse-13'>[13] <span>and among the lampstands was someone "like a son of man," </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-2" id="niv-verse-1-2">b</a>]</sup><span> dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.</span></div>

<div id='verse-14'>[14] <span>His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-15'>[15] <span>His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-16'>[16] <span>In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</span></div>

<div id='verse-17'>[17] <span>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</span></div>

<div id='verse-18'>[18] <span>I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.</span></div>

<div id='verse-19'>[19] <span>"Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.</span></div>

<div id='verse-20'>[20] <span>The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-1-3" id="niv-verse-1-3">c</a>]</sup><span> of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. </span></div>

<div>
<div id='verse-21'>[1] <span>"To the angel </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-1" id="niv-verse-2-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands:</span></div>

<div id='verse-22'>[2] <span>I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.</span></div>

<div id='verse-23'>[3] <span>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.</span></div>

<div id='verse-24'>[4] <span>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.</span></div>

<div id='verse-25'>[5] <span>Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</span></div>

<div id='verse-26'>[6] <span>But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span></div>

<div id='verse-27'>[7] <span>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God. </span></div>

<div id='verse-28'>[8] <span>"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-29'>[9] <span>I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span></div>

<div id='verse-30'>[10] <span>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span></div>

<div id='verse-31'>[11] <span>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death. </span></div>

<div id='verse-32'>[12] <span>"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.</span></div>

<div id='verse-33'>[13] <span>I know where you live--where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city--where Satan lives.</span></div>

<div id='verse-34'>[14] <span>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.</span></div>

<div id='verse-35'>[15] <span>Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span></div>

<div id='verse-36'>[16] <span>Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-37'>[17] <span>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it. </span></div>

<div id='verse-38'>[18] <span>"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.</span></div>

<div id='verse-39'>[19] <span>I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.</span></div>

<div id='verse-40'>[20] <span>Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.</span></div>

<div id='verse-41'>[21] <span>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.</span></div>

<div id='verse-42'>[22] <span>So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.</span></div>

<div id='verse-43'>[23] <span>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</span></div>

<div id='verse-44'>[24] <span>Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other burden on you):</span></div>

<div id='verse-45'>[25] <span>Only hold on to what you have until I come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-46'>[26] <span>To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations-- </span></div>

<div id='verse-47'>[27] <span>`He will rule them with an iron scepter; he will dash them to pieces like pottery' </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-2-2" id="niv-verse-2-2">b</a>]</sup><span> -- just as I have received authority from my Father.</span></div>

<div id='verse-48'>[28] <span>I will also give him the morning star.</span></div>

<div id='verse-57'>[8] <span>I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.</span></div>

<div id='verse-58'>[9] <span>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</span></div>

<div id='verse-61'>[12] <span>Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it.

<div id='verse-74'>[3] <span>And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.</span></div>

<div id='verse-75'>[4] <span>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.</span></div>

<div id='verse-76'>[5] <span>From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-4-1" id="niv-verse-4-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of God.</span></div>

<div id='verse-77'>[6] <span>Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.</span></div>

<div id='verse-85'>[3] <span>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.</span></div>

<div id='verse-86'>[4] <span>I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.</span></div>

<div id='verse-87'>[5] <span>Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."</span></div>

<div id='verse-88'>[6] <span>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-5-1" id="niv-verse-5-1">a</a>]</sup><span> of God sent out into all the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-89'>[7] <span>He came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</span></div>

<div id='verse-90'>[8] <span>And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span></div>

<div id='verse-91'>[9] <span>And they sang a new song: "You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.</span></div>

<div id='verse-100'>[4] <span>Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.</span></div>

<div id='verse-101'>[5] <span>When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.</span></div>

<div id='verse-104'>[8] <span>I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-105'>[9] <span>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.</span></div>

<div id='verse-106'>[10] <span>They called out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-107'>[11] <span>Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.</span></div>

<div id='verse-108'>[12] <span>I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,</span></div>

<div id='verse-122'>[9] <span>After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb.

<div id='verse-123'>[10] <span>And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb." </span></div>

<div id='verse-124'>[11] <span>All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,</span></div>

<div id='verse-125'>[12] <span>saying: "Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-126'>[13] <span>Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes--who are they, and where did they come from?"</span></div>

<div id='verse-127'>[14] <span>I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</span></div>

<div id='verse-128'>[15] <span>Therefore, "they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-129'>[16] <span>Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.</span></div>

<div id='verse-130'>[17] <span>For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</span></div>

<div id='verse-136'>[6] <span>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.</span></div>

<div id='verse-137'>[7] <span>The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</span></div>

<div id='verse-144'>[1] <span>The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.</span></div>

<div id='verse-145'>[2] <span>When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.</span></div>

<div id='verse-146'>[3] <span>And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-147'>[4] <span>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</span></div>

<div id='verse-148'>[5] <span>They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span></div>

<div id='verse-151'>[8] <span>Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-152'>[9] <span>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.</span></div>

<div id='verse-157'>[14] <span>It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."</span></div>

<div id='verse-166'>[2] <span>He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</span></div>

<div id='verse-167'>[3] <span>and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.</span></div>

<div id='verse-168'>[4] <span>And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down."</span></div>

<div id='verse-169'>[5] <span>Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-170'>[6] <span>And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, "There will be no more delay!</span></div>

<div id='verse-195'>[1] <span>A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.</span></div>

<div id='verse-196'>[2] <span>She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-197'>[3] <span>Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.</span></div>

<div id='verse-198'>[4] <span>His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born.</span></div>

<div id='verse-199'>[5] <span>She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.</span></div>

<div id='verse-200'>[6] <span>The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</span></div>

<div id='verse-201'>[7] <span>And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.</span></div>

<div id='verse-202'>[8] <span>But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.</span></div>

<div id='verse-203'>[9] <span>The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-204'>[10] <span>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.</span></div>

<div id='verse-205'>[11] <span>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.</span></div>

<div id='verse-208'>[14] <span>The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach.</span></div>

<div id='verse-209'>[15] <span>Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.</span></div>

<div id='verse-210'>[16] <span>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.</span></div>

<div id='verse-251'>[2] <span>And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps given them by God</span></div>

<div id='verse-255'>[6] <span>Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.</span></div>

<div id='verse-256'>[7] <span>Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-259'>[2] <span>The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.</span></div>

<div id='verse-260'>[3] <span>The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.</span></div>

<div id='verse-261'>[4] <span>The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-262'>[5] <span>Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: "You are just in these judgments, you who are and who were, the Holy One, because you have so judged;</span></div>

<div id='verse-263'>[6] <span>for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve." </span></div>

<div id='verse-264'>[7] <span>And I heard the altar respond: "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments."</span></div>

<div id='verse-265'>[8] <span>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-266'>[9] <span>They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-276'>[19] <span>The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-279'>[1] <span>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.</span></div>

<div id='verse-280'>[2] <span>With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries."</span></div>

<div id='verse-281'>[3] <span>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.</span></div>

<div id='verse-282'>[4] <span>The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.</span></div>

<div id='verse-283'>[5] <span>This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. </span></div>

<div id='verse-284'>[6] <span>I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.</span></div>

<div id='verse-285'>[7] <span>Then the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.</span></div>

<div id='verse-286'>[8] <span>The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.</span></div>

<div id='verse-287'>[9] <span>"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.</span></div>

<div id='verse-288'>[10] <span>They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while.</span></div>

<div id='verse-289'>[11] <span>The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.</span></div>

<div id='verse-290'>[12] <span>"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-291'>[13] <span>They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.</span></div>

<div id='verse-292'>[14] <span>They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers."</span></div>

<div id='verse-293'>[15] <span>Then the angel said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.</span></div>

<div id='verse-294'>[16] <span>The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.</span></div>

<div id='verse-295'>[17] <span>For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled.</span></div>

<div id='verse-296'>[18] <span>The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."</span></div>

<div id='verse-297'>[1] <span>After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.</span></div>

<div id='verse-298'>[2] <span>With a mighty voice he shouted: "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-18-1" id="niv-verse-18-1">a</a>]</sup><span> spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.</span></div>

<div id='verse-299'>[3] <span>For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries."</span></div>

<div id='verse-300'>[4] <span>Then I heard another voice from heaven say: "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;</span></div>

<div id='verse-301'>[5] <span>for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.</span></div>

<div id='verse-302'>[6] <span>Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup.</span></div>

<div id='verse-303'>[7] <span>Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, `I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-304'>[8] <span>Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-305'>[9] <span>"When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.</span></div>

<div id='verse-306'>[10] <span>Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!'</span></div>

<div id='verse-309'>[13] <span>cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men.</span></div>

<div id='verse-310'>[14] <span>"They will say, `The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.'</span></div>

<div id='verse-311'>[15] <span>The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn</span></div>

<div id='verse-312'>[16] <span>and cry out: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!</span></div>

<div id='verse-313'>[17] <span>In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' "Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.</span></div>

<div id='verse-314'>[18] <span>When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, `Was there ever a city like this great city?'</span></div>

<div id='verse-315'>[19] <span>They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!</span></div>

<div id='verse-316'>[20] <span>Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'"</span></div>

<div id='verse-317'>[21] <span>Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: "With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-318'>[22] <span>The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.</span></div>

<div id='verse-376'>[20] <span>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-21-4" id="niv-verse-21-4">d</a>]</sup> </div>

<div id='verse-377'>[21] <span>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.</span></div>

<div id='verse-378'>[22] <span>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</span></div>

<div id='verse-379'>[23] <span>The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.</span></div>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>
<div>
<div id='verse-384'>[1] <span>Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb</span></div>

<div id='verse-385'>[2] <span>down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</span></div>

<div id='verse-386'>[3] <span>No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.</span></div>

<div id='verse-387'>[4] <span>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</span></div>

<div id='verse-388'>[5] <span>There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.</span></div>

<div id='verse-389'>[6] <span>The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place."</span></div>

<div id='verse-390'>[7] <span>"Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book." </span></div>

<div id='verse-391'>[8] <span>I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.</span></div>

<div id='verse-392'>[9] <span>But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"</span></div>

<div id='verse-393'>[10] <span>Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.</span></div>

<div id='verse-394'>[11] <span>Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy." </span></div>

<div id='verse-395'>[12] <span>"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.</span></div>

<div id='verse-396'>[13] <span>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</span></div>

<div id='verse-397'>[14] <span>"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.</span></div>

<div id='verse-398'>[15] <span>Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</span></div>

<div id='verse-399'>[16] <span>"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you </span><sup>[<a href="#niv-footnote-22-1" id="niv-verse-22-1">a</a>]</sup><span> this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star." </span></div>

<div id='verse-400'>[17] <span>The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. </span></div>

<div id='verse-401'>[18] <span>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.</span></div>

<div id='verse-402'>[19] <span>And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</span></div>

<div id='verse-403'>[20] <span>He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</span></div>

<div id='verse-404'>[21] <span>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen. </span></div>
