 <h3>Genesis 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-1">Adam <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup> lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup> She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_3">3</a>]</sup> a man."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-2">Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-3">In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-4">But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-5">but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-6">Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-7">If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-8">Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_4">4</a>]</sup> And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-9">Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-10">The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-11">Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-12">When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-13">Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-14">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-15">But the LORD said to him, "Not so <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_5">5</a>]</sup> ; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-16">So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_6">6</a>]</sup> east of Eden.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-17">Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-19">Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-21">His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-22">Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_7">7</a>]</sup> bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_8">8</a>]</sup> a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-24">If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-25">Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_9">9</a>]</sup> saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-004-26">Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_10">10</a>]</sup> the name of the LORD.</li>
