 <h3>Genesis 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-1">When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-3">Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup> man forever, for he is mortal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup> ; his days will be a hundred and twenty years."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-5">The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-6">The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-7">So the LORD said, "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth--men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air--for I am grieved that I have made them."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-9">This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-10">Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-11">Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-12">God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-13">So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-14">So make yourself an ark of cypress <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_3">3</a>]</sup> wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-15">This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-16">Make a roof for it and finish <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_5">5</a>]</sup> the ark to within 18 inches <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_6">6</a>]</sup> of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-17">I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-18">But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-19">You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-20">Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-21">You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-006-22">Noah did everything just as God commanded him.</li>
