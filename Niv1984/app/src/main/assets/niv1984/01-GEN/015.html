 <h3>Genesis 15</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-1">After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup> your very great reward. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-2">But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup> my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-3">And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-4">Then the word of the LORD came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-5">He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the stars--if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-6">Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-7">He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-8">But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-9">So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-10">Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-11">Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-13">Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-14">But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-15">You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-16">In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-17">When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-18">On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_4">4</a>]</sup> of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates--</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-19">the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-20">Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-015-21">Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites."</li>
