 <h3>Genesis 16</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-1">Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-2">so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-3">So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-4">He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-5">Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-6">"Your servant is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-7">The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-8">And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-9">Then the angel of the LORD told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-10">The angel added, "I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-11">The angel of the LORD also said to her: "You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup> for the LORD has heard of your misery.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-12">He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_2">2</a>]</sup> all his brothers."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-13">She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_3">3</a>]</sup> the One who sees me."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-14">That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_4">4</a>]</sup> ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-15">So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-016-16">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</li>
