 <h3>Genesis 25</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-1">Abraham took <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup> another wife, whose name was Keturah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-2">She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-4">The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-5">Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-6">But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-7">Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-8">Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-9">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-10">the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_2">2</a>]</sup> There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-11">After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-12">This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-16">These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-17">Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-18">His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_3">3</a>]</sup> all their brothers.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-19">This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-20">and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_4">4</a>]</sup> and sister of Laban the Aramean.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-21">Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-22">The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-23">The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-24">When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-25">The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-26">After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_6">6</a>]</sup> Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-27">The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-28">Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-29">Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-30">He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_7">7</a>]</sup> )</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-31">Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-32">"Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-33">But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-025-34">Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.</li>
