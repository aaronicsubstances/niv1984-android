 <h3>Genesis 32</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-1">Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-2">When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-3">Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-4">He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my master Esau: `Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-5">I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-6">When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-7">In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_2">2</a>]</sup> and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-8">He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_3">3</a>]</sup> the group <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_4">4</a>]</sup> that is left may escape."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-9">Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, `Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-10">I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-11">Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-12">But you have said, `I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-13">He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-14">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-15">thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-16">He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-17">He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, `To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-18">then you are to say, `They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-19">He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-20">And be sure to say, `Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-21">So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-22">That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-23">After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-24">So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-25">When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-26">Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-27">The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-28">Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_5">5</a>]</sup> because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-29">Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-30">So Jacob called the place Peniel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_6">6</a>]</sup> saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-31">The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_7">7</a>]</sup> and he was limping because of his hip.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-032-32">Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.</li>
