 <h3>Genesis 33</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-1">Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-2">He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-3">He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-4">But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-5">Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-6">Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-7">Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-8">Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-9">But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-10">"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-11">Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-12">Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-13">But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-14">So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-15">Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-16">So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-17">Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-18">After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_2">2</a>]</sup> he arrived safely at the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_3">3</a>]</sup> city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-19">For a hundred pieces of silver, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_4">4</a>]</sup> he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-033-20">There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
