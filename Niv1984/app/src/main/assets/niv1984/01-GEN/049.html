 <h3>Genesis 49</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-1">Then Jacob called for his sons and said: "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-2">"Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-3">"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-4">Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-5">"Simeon and Levi are brothers-- their swords <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_1">1</a>]</sup> are weapons of violence.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-6">Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-7">Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-8">"Judah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_2">2</a>]</sup> your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-9">You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse him?</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-10">The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_3">3</a>]</sup> and the obedience of the nations is his.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-11">He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-12">His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-13">"Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-14">"Issachar is a rawboned <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_5">5</a>]</sup> donkey lying down between two saddlebags. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_6">6</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-15">When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-16">"Dan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_7">7</a>]</sup> will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-17">Dan will be a serpent by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-18">"I look for your deliverance, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-19">"Gad <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_8">8</a>]</sup> will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-20">"Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-21">"Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_9">9</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-22">"Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_10">10</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-23">With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-24">But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_11">11</a>]</sup> limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-25">because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_12">12</a>]</sup> who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-26">Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_13">13</a>]</sup> the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_14">14</a>]</sup> his brothers.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-27">"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder."</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-28">All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-29">Then he gave them these instructions: "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-30">the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-31">There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-32">The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_15">15</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="01-GEN-049-33">When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.</li>
