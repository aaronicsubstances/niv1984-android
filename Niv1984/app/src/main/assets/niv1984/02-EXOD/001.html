 <h3>Exodus 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-1">These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-3">Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-4">Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-5">The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_1">1</a>]</sup> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-6">Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-7">but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-8">Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-9">"Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-10">Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-11">So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-12">But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-13">and worked them ruthlessly.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-14">They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-15">The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-16">"When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-17">The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-18">Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-19">The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-20">So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-21">And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-001-22">Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: "Every boy that is born <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_2">2</a>]</sup> you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."</li>
