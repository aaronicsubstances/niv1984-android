 <h3>Exodus 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-1">Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-2">God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_1">1</a>]</sup> but by my name the LORD <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_2">2</a>]</sup> I did not make myself known to them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-4">I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-5">Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-6">"Therefore, say to the Israelites: `I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-7">I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-8">And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-9">Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-10">Then the LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-11">"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-12">But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_4">4</a>]</sup> ?"</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-13">Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-14">These were the heads of their families <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_5">5</a>]</sup> : The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</li>

  <li id="02-EXOD-006-17">The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-18">The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</li>

  <li id="02-EXOD-006-26">It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-27">They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-28">Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-29">he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-006-30">But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"</li>
