 <h3>Exodus 26</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-1">"Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-2">All the curtains are to be the same size--twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-3">Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-4">Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-5">Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-6">Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-7">"Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle--eleven altogether.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-8">All eleven curtains are to be the same size--thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-9">Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-10">Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-11">Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-12">As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-13">The tent curtains will be a cubit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_3">3</a>]</sup> longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-14">Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-15">"Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-16">Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-17">with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-18">Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-19">and make forty silver bases to go under them--two bases for each frame, one under each projection.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-20">For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-21">and forty silver bases--two under each frame.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-22">Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-23">and make two frames for the corners at the far end.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-24">At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-25">So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases--two under each frame.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-26">"Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-27">five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-28">The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-29">Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-30">"Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-31">"Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-32">Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-33">Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-34">Put the atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-35">Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-36">"For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-026-37">Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them.</li>
