 <h3>Exodus 31</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-2">"See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-3">and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts--</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-4">to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-5">to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-6">Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you:</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-7">the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent--</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-8">the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-9">the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand--</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-10">and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-11">and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you."</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-12">Then the LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-13">"Say to the Israelites, `You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-14">"`Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-15">For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-16">The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-17">It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.'"</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-031-18">When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</li>
