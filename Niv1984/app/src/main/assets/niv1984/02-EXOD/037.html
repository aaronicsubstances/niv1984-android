 <h3>Exodus 37</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-1">Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-2">He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-3">He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-4">Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-5">And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-6">He made the atonement cover of pure gold--two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-7">Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-8">He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-9">The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-10">They <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_3">3</a>]</sup> made the table of acacia wood--two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-11">Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-12">They also made around it a rim a handbreadth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_5">5</a>]</sup> wide and put a gold molding on the rim.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-13">They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-14">The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-15">The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-16">And they made from pure gold the articles for the table--its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-17">They made the lampstand of pure gold and hammered it out, base and shaft; its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms were of one piece with it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-18">Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand--three on one side and three on the other.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-19">Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-20">And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-21">One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair--six branches in all.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-22">The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-23">They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-24">They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_6">6</a>]</sup> of pure gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-25">They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_7">7</a>]</sup> --its horns of one piece with it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-26">They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-27">They made two gold rings below the molding--two on opposite sides--to hold the poles used to carry it.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-28">They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</li>
  <li id="02-EXOD-037-29">They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense--the work of a perfumer.</li>
