 <h3>Leviticus 18</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-1">The LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-2">"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `I am the LORD your God.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-3">You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-4">You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the LORD your God.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-5">Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-6">"`No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-7">"`Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-8">"`Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-9">"`Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-10">"`Do not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; that would dishonor you.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-11">"`Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-12">"`Do not have sexual relations with your father's sister; she is your father's close relative.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-13">"`Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister, because she is your mother's close relative.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-14">"`Do not dishonor your father's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-15">"`Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; do not have relations with her.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-16">"`Do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife; that would dishonor your brother.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-17">"`Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sexual relations with either her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-18">"`Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-19">"`Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-20">"`Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor's wife and defile yourself with her.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-21">"`Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup> to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-22">"`Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-23">"`Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-24">"`Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-25">Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-26">But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things,</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-27">for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-28">And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-29">"`Everyone who does any of these detestable things--such persons must be cut off from their people.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-018-30">Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the LORD your God.'"</li>
