 <h3>Leviticus 24</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-1">The LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-2">"Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-3">Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-4">The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-5">"Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup> for each loaf.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-6">Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-7">Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the LORD by fire.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-8">This bread is to be set out before the LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-9">It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire."</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-10">Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-11">The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-12">They put him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-13">Then the LORD said to Moses:</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-14">"Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-15">Say to the Israelites: `If anyone curses his God, he will be held responsible;</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-16">anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-17">"`If anyone takes the life of a human being, he must be put to death.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-18">Anyone who takes the life of someone's animal must make restitution--life for life.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-19">If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-20">fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other, so he is to be injured.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-21">Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-22">You are to have the same law for the alien and the native-born. I am the LORD your God.'"</li>
  <li id="03-LEV-024-23">Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses.</li>
