  <li id="04-NUM-007-1">When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-007-2">Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-007-3">They brought as their gifts before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen--an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-007-4">The LORD said to Moses,</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-007-5">"Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man's work requires."</li>
