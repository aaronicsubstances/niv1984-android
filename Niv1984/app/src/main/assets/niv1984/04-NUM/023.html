 <h3>Numbers 23</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-1">Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-2">Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-3">Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-4">God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-5">The LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-6">So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-7">Then Balaam uttered his oracle: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. `Come,' he said, `curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-8">How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-9">From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-10">Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-11">Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-12">He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-13">Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-14">So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-15">Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-16">The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-17">So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-18">Then he uttered his oracle: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-19">God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-20">I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-21">"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_105861046_1">1</a>]</sup> The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-22">God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-23">There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, `See what God has done!'</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-24">The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-25">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-26">Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-27">Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-28">And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-29">Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-023-30">Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</li>
