 <h3>Numbers 24</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-1">Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-2">When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-3">and he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-4">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_1">1</a>]</sup> who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-5">"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-6">"Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-7">Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-8">"God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-9">Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse them? "May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!"</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-10">Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-11">Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-12">Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-13">`Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD--and I must say only what the LORD says'?</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-14">Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-15">Then he uttered his oracle: "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-16">the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-17">"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_2">2</a>]</sup> of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_3">3</a>]</sup> all the sons of Sheth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-18">Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-19">A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-20">Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: "Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-21">Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-22">yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-23">Then he uttered his oracle: "Ah, who can live when God does this? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-24">Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin."</li>
  <li id="04-NUM-024-25">Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.</li>
