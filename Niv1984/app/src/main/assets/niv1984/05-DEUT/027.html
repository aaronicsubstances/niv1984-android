  <li id="05-DEUT-027-8">And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up."</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-9">Then Moses and the priests, who are Levites, said to all Israel, "Be silent, O Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the LORD your God.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-10">Obey the LORD your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today."</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-11">On the same day Moses commanded the people:</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-12">When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-13">And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-14">The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice:</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-15">"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol--a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands--and sets it up in secret." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-16">"Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-17">"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>

  <li id="05-DEUT-027-20">"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-21">"Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-22">"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-027-23">"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"</li>
