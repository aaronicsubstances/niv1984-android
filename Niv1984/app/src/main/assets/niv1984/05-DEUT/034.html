 <h3>Deuteronomy 34</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-1">Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land--from Gilead to Dan,</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-2">all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-3">the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-4">Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, `I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it."</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-5">And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-6">He buried him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_2">2</a>]</sup> in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-7">Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-8">The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-9">Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_3">3</a>]</sup> of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-10">Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-11">who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.</li>
  <li id="05-DEUT-034-12">For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.</li>
