 <h3>Joshua 16</h3>

  <li id="06-JOSH-016-1">The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_1">1</a>]</sup> east of the waters of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-2">It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), <sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_2">2</a>]</sup> crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-3">descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-4">So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-5">This was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-6">and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-7">Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-8">From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-9">It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.</li>
  <li id="06-JOSH-016-10">They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.</li>
