 <h3>Judges 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-1">On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-2">"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves-- praise the LORD!</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-3">"Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_1">1</a>]</sup> the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_2">2</a>]</sup> the LORD, the God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-4">"O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-5">The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-6">"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-7">Village life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_3">3</a>]</sup> in Israel ceased, ceased until I, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_4">4</a>]</sup> Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-8">When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-9">My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD!</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-10">"You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-11">the voice of the singers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_5">5</a>]</sup> at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_6">6</a>]</sup> in Israel. "Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-12">`Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.'</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-13">"Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-14">Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-15">The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-16">Why did you stay among the campfires <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_7">7</a>]</sup> to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-17">Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-18">The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-19">"Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-20">From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-21">The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-22">Then thundered the horses' hoofs-- galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-23">`Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. `Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.'</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-24">"Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-25">He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-26">Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-27">At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-28">"Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, `Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?'</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-29">The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-30">`Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck-- all this as plunder?'</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-005-31">"So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had peace forty years.</li>
