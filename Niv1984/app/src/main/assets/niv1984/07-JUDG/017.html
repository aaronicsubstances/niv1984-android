 <h3>Judges 17</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-1">Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-2">said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_1">1</a>]</sup> of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse--I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!"</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-3">When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you."</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-4">So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_2">2</a>]</sup> of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-5">Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-6">In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-7">A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-8">left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_3">3</a>]</sup> he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-9">Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-10">Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_4">4</a>]</sup> of silver a year, your clothes and your food."</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-11">So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-12">Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.</li>
  <li id="07-JUDG-017-13">And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."</li>
