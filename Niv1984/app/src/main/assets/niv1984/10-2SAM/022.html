 <h3>2 Samuel 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-1">David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-2">He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-3">my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_1">1</a>]</sup> of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior-- from violent men you save me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-4">I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-5">"The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-6">The cords of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_2">2</a>]</sup> coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-7">In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-8">"The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_3">3</a>]</sup> shook; they trembled because he was angry.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-9">Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-10">He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-11">He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_4">4</a>]</sup> on the wings of the wind.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-12">He made darkness his canopy around him-- the dark <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_5">5</a>]</sup> rain clouds of the sky.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-13">Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-14">The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-15">He shot arrows and scattered [the enemies], bolts of lightning and routed them.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-16">The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-17">"He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-18">He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-19">They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-20">He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-21">"The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-22">For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-23">All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-24">I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-25">The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_6">6</a>]</sup> in his sight.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-26">"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-27">to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-28">You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-29">You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-30">With your help I can advance against a troop <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_7">7</a>]</sup> ; with my God I can scale a wall.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-31">"As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-32">For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-33">It is God who arms me with strength <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_8">8</a>]</sup> and makes my way perfect.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-34">He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-35">He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-36">You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-37">You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-38">"I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-39">I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-40">You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-41">You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-42">They cried for help, but there was no one to save them-- to the LORD, but he did not answer.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-43">I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-44">"You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me,</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-45">and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-46">They all lose heart; they come trembling <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_9">9</a>]</sup> from their strongholds.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-47">"The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-48">He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-49">who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-50">Therefore I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.</li>
  <li id="10-2SAM-022-51">He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever."</li>
