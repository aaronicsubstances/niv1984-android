 <h3>1 Kings 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-1">When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do,</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-2">the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-3">The LORD said to him: "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-4">"As for you, if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws,</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-5">I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, `You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-6">"But if you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_1">1</a>]</sup> or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_2">2</a>]</sup> and go off to serve other gods and worship them,</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-7">then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-8">And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, `Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-9">People will answer, `Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them--that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'"</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-10">At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings--the temple of the LORD and the royal palace--</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-11">King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-12">But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-13">"What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_3">3</a>]</sup> a name they have to this day.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-14">Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_4">4</a>]</sup> of gold.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-15">Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_5">5</a>]</sup> the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-16">(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-17">And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon,</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-18">Baalath, and Tadmor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_6">6</a>]</sup> in the desert, within his land,</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-19">as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_7">7</a>]</sup> --whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-20">All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-21">that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_8">8</a>]</sup> --these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-22">But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-23">They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects--550 officials supervising the men who did the work.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-24">After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the supporting terraces.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-25">Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_9">9</a>]</sup> on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-26">King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_10">10</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-27">And Hiram sent his men--sailors who knew the sea--to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.</li>
  <li id="11-1KGS-009-28">They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_11">11</a>]</sup> of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</li>
