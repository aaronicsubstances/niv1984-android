 <h3>2 Chronicles 17</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-1">Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-2">He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-3">The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-4">but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-5">The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-6">His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-7">In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-8">With them were certain Levites--Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah--and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-9">They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-10">The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-11">Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-12">Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-13">and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-14">Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-15">next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-16">next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-17">From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-18">next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.</li>
  <li id="14-2CHRON-017-19">These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</li>
