 <h3>Job 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-001-1">In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-2">He had seven sons and three daughters,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-3">and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-4">His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-5">When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-6">One day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup> also came with them.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-7">The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-8">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-9">"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-10">"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-11">But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-12">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-13">One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-14">a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-15">and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</li>
  <li id="verse-001-16">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</li>
  <li id="verse-001-17">While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</li>
  <li id="verse-001-18">While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,</li>
  <li id="verse-001-19">when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"</li>
  <li id="verse-001-20">At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship</li>
  <li id="verse-001-21">and said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_3">3</a>]</sup> The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</li>
  <li id="verse-001-22">In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.</li>

 <h3>Job 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-002-1">On another day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_202814600_1">1</a>]</sup> came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-2">And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."</li>
  <li id="verse-002-3">Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."</li>
  <li id="verse-002-4">"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-5">But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."</li>
  <li id="verse-002-6">The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."</li>
  <li id="verse-002-7">So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-8">Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-9">His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"</li>
  <li id="verse-002-10">He replied, "You are talking like a foolish <sup>[<a href="#footnote_202814600_2">2</a>]</sup> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-11">When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-12">When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.</li>
  <li id="verse-002-13">Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.</li>

 <h3>Job 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-003-1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-2">He said:</li>
  <li id="verse-003-3">"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'</li>
  <li id="verse-003-4">That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-5">May darkness and deep shadow <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-6">That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-7">May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-8">May those who curse days <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup> curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-9">May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</li>
  <li id="verse-003-10">for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-11">"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-12">Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</li>
  <li id="verse-003-14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</li>
  <li id="verse-003-15">with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-16">Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-17">There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-18">Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-20">"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</li>
  <li id="verse-003-21">to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</li>
  <li id="verse-003-22">who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</li>
  <li id="verse-003-24">For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</li>
  <li id="verse-003-25">What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</li>

  <li id="verse-004-2">"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</li>

  <li id="verse-004-7">"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</li>
  <li id="verse-004-8">As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</li>
  <li id="verse-004-9">At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</li>

  <li id="verse-005-5">The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</li>
  <li id="verse-005-6">For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</li>

  <li id="verse-009-2">"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</li>
  <li id="verse-009-3">Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-4">His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</li>
  <li id="verse-009-5">He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-6">He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-7">He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-10">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-11">When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-12">If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, `What are you doing?'</li>
  <li id="verse-009-13">God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-14">"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?</li>
  <li id="verse-009-15">Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-16">Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-17">He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.</li>

  <li id="verse-009-20">Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.</li>
  <li id="verse-009-21">"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</li>

  <li id="verse-032-3">He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_1">1</a>]</sup></li>

  <li id="verse-032-6">So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.</li>

  <li id="verse-032-11">I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,</li>
  <li id="verse-032-12">I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</li>
  <li id="verse-032-13">Do not say, `We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'</li>
  <li id="verse-032-14">But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</li>
  <li id="verse-032-15">"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</li>
  <li id="verse-032-16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</li>
  <li id="verse-032-17">I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</li>

 <h3>Job 42</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-042-1">Then Job replied to the LORD:</li>
  <li id="verse-042-2">"I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-3">[You asked,] `Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-4">["You said,] `Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'</li>
  <li id="verse-042-5">My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-6">Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."</li>
  <li id="verse-042-7">After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-8">So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</li>
  <li id="verse-042-9">So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-10">After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-11">All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167038174_1">1</a>]</sup> and a gold ring.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-12">The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-13">And he also had seven sons and three daughters.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-14">The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-15">Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-16">After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.</li>
  <li id="verse-042-17">And so he died, old and full of years.</li>
