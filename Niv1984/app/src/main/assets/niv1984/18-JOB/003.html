 <h3>Job 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-2">He said:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-3">"May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-4">That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-5">May darkness and deep shadow <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup> claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-6">That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-7">May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-8">May those who curse days <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup> curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-9">May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-10">for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-11">"Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-12">Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-15">with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-16">Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-17">There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-18">Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-20">"Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-21">to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-22">who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-24">For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-25">What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-003-26">I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."</li>
