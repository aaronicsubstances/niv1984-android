 <h3>Job 4</h3>

  <li id="18-JOB-004-1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-2">"If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-3">Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-4">Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-5">But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-6">Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-7">"Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-8">As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-9">At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-10">The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-11">The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-12">"A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-13">Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-14">fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-15">A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-16">It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-17">`Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-18">If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-19">how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-20">Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-004-21">Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
