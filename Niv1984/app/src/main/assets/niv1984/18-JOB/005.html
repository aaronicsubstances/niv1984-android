 <h3>Job 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-1">"Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-2">Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-3">I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-4">His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-5">The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-6">For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-7">Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-8">"But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-9">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-10">He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-11">The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-12">He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-13">He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-14">Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-15">He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-17">"Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-18">For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-19">From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-20">In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-21">You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-22">You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-23">For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-24">You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-25">You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-26">You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-005-27">"We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."</li>
