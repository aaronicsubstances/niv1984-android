 <h3>Job 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-2">"If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-3">It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas-- no wonder my words have been impetuous.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-4">The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-5">Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-6">Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-7">I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-8">"Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-9">that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-10">Then I would still have this consolation-- my joy in unrelenting pain-- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-11">"What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-12">Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-13">Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-14">"A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-15">But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-16">when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-17">but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-18">Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-19">The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-20">They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-21">Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-22">Have I ever said, `Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-23">deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-24">"Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-25">How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-26">Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-27">You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-28">"But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-29">Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-006-30">Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?</li>
