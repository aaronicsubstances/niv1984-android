 <h3>Job 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-1">"Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-2">Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-3">so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-4">When I lie down I think, `How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-5">My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-6">"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-7">Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-8">The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-9">As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup> does not return.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-10">He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-11">"Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-12">Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-13">When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-14">even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-15">so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-16">I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-17">"What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-18">that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-19">Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-20">If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-007-21">Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."</li>
