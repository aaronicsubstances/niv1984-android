 <h3>Job 8</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-2">"How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-3">Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-4">When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-5">But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-6">if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-7">Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-8">"Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-9">for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-10">Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-11">Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-12">While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-13">Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-14">What he trusts in is fragile <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_1">1</a>]</sup> ; what he relies on is a spider's web.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-15">He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-16">He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-17">it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-18">But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, `I never saw you.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-19">Surely its life withers away, and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_2">2</a>]</sup> from the soil other plants grow.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-20">"Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-21">He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-008-22">Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."</li>
