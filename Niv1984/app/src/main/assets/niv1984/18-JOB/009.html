 <h3>Job 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-2">"Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-3">Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-4">His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-5">He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-6">He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-7">He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-10">He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-11">When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-12">If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, `What are you doing?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-13">God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-14">"How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-15">Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-16">Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-17">He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-18">He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-19">If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_974960152_1">1</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-20">Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-21">"Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-22">It is all the same; that is why I say, `He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-23">When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-24">When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-25">"My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-26">They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-27">If I say, `I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-28">I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-29">Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-30">Even if I washed myself with soap <sup>[<a href="#footnote_974960152_2">2</a>]</sup> and my hands with washing soda,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-31">you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-32">"He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-33">If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-34">someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-009-35">Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.</li>
