 <h3>Job 10</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-1">"I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-2">I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-3">Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-4">Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-5">Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-6">that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-7">though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-8">"Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-9">Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-10">Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-11">clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-12">You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-13">"But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-14">If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-15">If I am guilty--woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup> my affliction.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-16">If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-17">You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-18">"Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-19">If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-20">Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-21">before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-010-22">to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."</li>
