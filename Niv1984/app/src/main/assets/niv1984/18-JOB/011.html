 <h3>Job 11</h3>

  <li id="18-JOB-011-1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-2">"Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-3">Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-4">You say to God, `My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-5">Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-6">and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-7">"Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-8">They are higher than the heavens--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_1">1</a>]</sup> --what can you know?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-9">Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-10">"If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-11">Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-12">But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-13">"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-14">if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-15">then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-16">You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-17">Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-18">You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-19">You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-011-20">But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp."</li>
