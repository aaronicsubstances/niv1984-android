 <h3>Job 12</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-2">"Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-3">But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-4">"I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered-- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-5">Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-6">The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure-- those who carry their god in their hands. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68325204_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-7">"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-8">or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-9">Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-10">In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-11">Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-12">Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-13">"To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-14">What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-15">If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-16">To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-17">He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-18">He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68325204_2">2</a>]</sup> around their waist.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-19">He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-20">He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-21">He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-22">He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-23">He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-24">He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-012-25">They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.</li>
