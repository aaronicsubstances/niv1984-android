 <h3>Job 14</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-1">"Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-2">He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-3">Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup> before you for judgment?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-4">Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-5">Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-6">So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-7">"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-8">Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-9">yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-10">But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-11">As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-12">so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-13">"If only you would hide me in the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup> and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-14">If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup> to come.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-15">You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-16">Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-17">My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-18">"But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-19">as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-20">You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-21">If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-014-22">He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."</li>
