 <h3>Job 15</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-2">"Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-3">Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-4">But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-5">Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-6">Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-7">"Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-8">Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-9">What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-10">The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-11">Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-12">Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-13">so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-14">"What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-15">If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-16">how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-17">"Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-18">what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-19">(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-20">All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-21">Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-22">He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-23">He wanders about--food for vultures <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup> ; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-24">Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-25">because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-26">defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-27">"Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-28">he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-29">He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-30">He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-31">Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-32">Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-33">He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-34">For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-015-35">They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."</li>
