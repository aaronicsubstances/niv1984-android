 <h3>Job 16</h3>

  <li id="18-JOB-016-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-2">"I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-3">Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-4">I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-5">But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-6">"Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-7">Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-8">You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-9">God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-10">Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-11">God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-12">All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-13">his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-14">Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-15">"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-16">My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-17">yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-18">"O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-19">Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-20">My intercessor is my friend <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207182871_1">1</a>]</sup> as my eyes pour out tears to God;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-21">on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-016-22">"Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.</li>
