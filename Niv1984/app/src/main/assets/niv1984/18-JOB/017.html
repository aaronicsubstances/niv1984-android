 <h3>Job 17</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-1">My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-2">Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-3">"Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-4">You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-5">If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-6">"God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-7">My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-8">Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-9">Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-10">"But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-11">My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-12">These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, `Light is near.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-13">If the only home I hope for is the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_1">1</a>]</sup> if I spread out my bed in darkness,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-14">if I say to corruption, `You are my father,' and to the worm, `My mother' or `My sister,'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-15">where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-017-16">Will it go down to the gates of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_2">2</a>]</sup> ? Will we descend together into the dust?"</li>
