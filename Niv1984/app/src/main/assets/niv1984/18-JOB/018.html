 <h3>Job 18</h3>

  <li id="18-JOB-018-1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-2">"When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-3">Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-4">You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-5">"The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-6">The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-7">The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-8">His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-9">A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-10">A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-11">Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-12">Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-13">It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-14">He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-15">Fire resides <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_1">1</a>]</sup> in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-16">His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-17">The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-18">He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-19">He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-20">Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-018-21">Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."</li>
