 <h3>Job 19</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-2">"How long will you torment me and crush me with words?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-3">Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-4">If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-5">If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-6">then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-7">"Though I cry, `I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-8">He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-9">He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-10">He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-11">His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-12">His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-13">"He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-14">My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-15">My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-16">I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-17">My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-18">Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-19">All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-20">I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-21">"Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-22">Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-23">"Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-24">that they were inscribed with an iron tool on <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_2">2</a>]</sup> lead, or engraved in rock forever!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-25">I know that my Redeemer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_3">3</a>]</sup> lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-26">And after my skin has been destroyed, yet <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_5">5</a>]</sup> in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_6">6</a>]</sup> my flesh I will see God;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-27">I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-28">"If you say, `How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_7">7</a>]</sup> '</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-019-29">you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_8">8</a>]</sup> "</li>
