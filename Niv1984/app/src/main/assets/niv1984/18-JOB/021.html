 <h3>Job 21</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-2">"Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-3">Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-4">"Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-5">Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-6">When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-7">Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-8">They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-9">Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-10">Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-11">They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-12">They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-13">They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_1">1</a>]</sup> in peace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-14">Yet they say to God, `Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-15">Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-16">But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-17">"Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-18">How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-19">[It is said,] `God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-20">Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-21">For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-22">"Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-23">One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-24">his body <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_4">4</a>]</sup> well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-25">Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-26">Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-27">"I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-28">You say, `Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-29">Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-30">that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_5">5</a>]</sup> the day of wrath?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-31">Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-32">He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-33">The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_6">6</a>]</sup> before him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-021-34">"So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!"</li>
