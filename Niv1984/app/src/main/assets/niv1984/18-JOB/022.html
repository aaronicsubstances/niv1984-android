 <h3>Job 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-2">"Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-3">What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-4">"Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-5">Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-6">You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-7">You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-8">though you were a powerful man, owning land-- an honored man, living on it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-9">And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-10">That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-11">why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-12">"Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-13">Yet you say, `What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-14">Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-15">Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-16">They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-17">They said to God, `Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-18">Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-19">"The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-20">`Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-21">"Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-22">Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-23">If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-24">and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-25">then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-26">Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-27">You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-28">What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-29">When men are brought low and you say, `Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-022-30">He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</li>
