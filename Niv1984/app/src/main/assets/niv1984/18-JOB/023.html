 <h3>Job 23</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-2">"Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup> is heavy in spite of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup> my groaning.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-3">If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-4">I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-5">I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-6">Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-7">There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-8">"But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-9">When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-10">But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-11">My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-12">I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-13">"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-14">He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-15">That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-16">God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-023-17">Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</li>
