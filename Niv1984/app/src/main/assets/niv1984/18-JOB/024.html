 <h3>Job 24</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-1">"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-2">Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-3">They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-4">They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-5">Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-6">They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-7">Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-8">They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-9">The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-10">Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-11">They crush olives among the terraces <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup> ; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-12">The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-13">"There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-14">When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-15">The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, `No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-16">In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-17">For all of them, deep darkness is their morning <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_2">2</a>]</sup> ; they make friends with the terrors of darkness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-18">"Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-19">As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_4">4</a>]</sup> snatches away those who have sinned.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-20">The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-21">They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-22">But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-23">He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-24">For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-024-25">"If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?"</li>
