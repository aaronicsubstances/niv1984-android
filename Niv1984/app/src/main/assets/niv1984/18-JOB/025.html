 <h3>Job 25</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-2">"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-3">Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-4">How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-5">If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-025-6">how much less man, who is but a maggot-- a son of man, who is only a worm!"</li>
