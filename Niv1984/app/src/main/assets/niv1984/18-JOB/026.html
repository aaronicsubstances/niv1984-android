 <h3>Job 26</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-1">Then Job replied:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-2">"How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-3">What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-4">Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-5">"The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-6">Death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup> is naked before God; Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_2">2</a>]</sup> lies uncovered.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-7">He spreads out the northern [skies] over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-8">He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-9">He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-10">He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-11">The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-12">By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-13">By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-026-14">And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"</li>
