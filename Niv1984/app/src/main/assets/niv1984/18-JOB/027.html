 <h3>Job 27</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-1">And Job continued his discourse:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-2">"As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-3">as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-4">my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-5">I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-6">I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-7">"May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-8">For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-9">Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-10">Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-11">"I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-12">You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-13">"Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-14">However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-15">The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-16">Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-17">what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-18">The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-19">He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-21">The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-22">It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-027-23">It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.</li>
