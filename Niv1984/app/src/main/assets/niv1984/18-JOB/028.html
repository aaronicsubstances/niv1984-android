 <h3>Job 28</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-1">"There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-2">Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-3">Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-4">Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-5">The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-6">sapphires <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_1">1</a>]</sup> come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-7">No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-8">Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-9">Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-10">He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-11">He searches <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_2">2</a>]</sup> the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-12">"But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-13">Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-14">The deep says, `It is not in me'; the sea says, `It is not with me.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-15">It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-16">It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-17">Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-18">Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-19">The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-20">"Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-21">It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-22">Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_3">3</a>]</sup> and Death say, `Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-23">God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-24">for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-25">When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-26">when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-27">then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-028-28">And he said to man, `The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'"</li>
