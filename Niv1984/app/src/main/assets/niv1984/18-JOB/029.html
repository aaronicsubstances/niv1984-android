 <h3>Job 29</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-1">Job continued his discourse:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-2">"How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-3">when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-4">Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-5">when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-6">when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-7">"When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-8">the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-9">the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-10">the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-11">Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-12">because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-13">The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-14">I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-15">I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-16">I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-17">I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-18">"I thought, `I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-19">My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-20">My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-21">"Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-22">After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-23">They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-24">When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-029-25">I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.</li>
