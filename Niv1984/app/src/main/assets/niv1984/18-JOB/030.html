 <h3>Job 30</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-1">"But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-2">Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-3">Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup> the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-4">In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup> was the root of the broom tree.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-5">They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-6">They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-7">They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-8">A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-9">"And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-10">They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-11">Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-12">On my right the tribe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup> attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-13">They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me-- without anyone's helping them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-14">They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-15">Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-16">"And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-17">Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-18">In his great power [God] becomes like clothing to me <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup> ; he binds me like the neck of my garment.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-19">He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-20">"I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-21">You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-22">You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-23">I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-24">"Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-25">Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-26">Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-27">The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-28">I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-29">I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-30">My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-030-31">My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.</li>
