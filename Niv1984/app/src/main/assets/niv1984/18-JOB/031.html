 <h3>Job 31</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-1">"I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-2">For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-3">Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-4">Does he not see my ways and count my every step?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-5">"If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-6">let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-7">if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-8">then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-9">"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-10">then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-11">For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-12">It is a fire that burns to Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_1">1</a>]</sup> ; it would have uprooted my harvest.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-13">"If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-14">what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-15">Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-16">"If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-17">if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-18">but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-19">if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-20">and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-21">if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-22">then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-23">For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-24">"If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, `You are my security,'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-25">if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-26">if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-27">so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-28">then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-29">"If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-30">I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-31">if the men of my household have never said, `Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-32">but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-33">if I have concealed my sin as men do, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_2">2</a>]</sup> by hiding my guilt in my heart</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-34">because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-35">("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-36">Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-37">I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-38">"if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-39">if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-031-40">then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.</li>
