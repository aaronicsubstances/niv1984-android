 <h3>Job 32</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-2">But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-3">He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-4">Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-5">But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-6">So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-7">I thought, `Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-8">But it is the spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_2">2</a>]</sup> in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-9">It is not only the old <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_3">3</a>]</sup> who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-10">"Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-11">I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-12">I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-13">Do not say, `We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-14">But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-15">"They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-17">I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-18">For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-19">inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-21">I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-032-22">for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.</li>
