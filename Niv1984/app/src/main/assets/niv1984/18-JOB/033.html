 <h3>Job 33</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-1">"But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-2">I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-3">My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-4">The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-5">Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-6">I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-7">No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-8">"But you have said in my hearing-- I heard the very words--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-9">`I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-10">Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-11">He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-12">"But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-13">Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_1">1</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-14">For God does speak--now one way, now another-- though man may not perceive it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-16">he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-17">to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-18">to preserve his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_2">2</a>]</sup> his life from perishing by the sword. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-19">Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-20">so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-21">His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-22">His soul draws near to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_4">4</a>]</sup> and his life to the messengers of death. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-23">"Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-24">to be gracious to him and say, `Spare him from going down to the pit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_6">6</a>]</sup> ; I have found a ransom for him'--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-25">then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-26">He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-27">Then he comes to men and says, `I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_7">7</a>]</sup> and I will live to enjoy the light.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-29">"God does all these things to a man-- twice, even three times--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-30">to turn back his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_8">8</a>]</sup> that the light of life may shine on him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-31">"Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-32">If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-033-33">But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."</li>
