 <h3>Job 34</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-1">Then Elihu said:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-2">"Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-3">For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-4">Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-5">"Job says, `I am innocent, but God denies me justice.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-6">Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-7">What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-8">He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-9">For he says, `It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-10">"So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-11">He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-12">It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-13">Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-14">If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_1">1</a>]</sup> and breath,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-15">all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-16">"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-17">Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-18">Is he not the One who says to kings, `You are worthless,' and to nobles, `You are wicked,'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-19">who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-20">They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-21">"His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-22">There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-23">God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-24">Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-25">Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-26">He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-27">because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-28">They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-29">But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-30">to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-31">"Suppose a man says to God, `I am guilty but will offend no more.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-32">Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-33">Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-34">"Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-35">`Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-36">Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-034-37">To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."</li>
