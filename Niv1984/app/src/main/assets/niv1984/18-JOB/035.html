 <h3>Job 35</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-1">Then Elihu said:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-2">"Do you think this is just? You say, `I will be cleared by God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup> '</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-3">Yet you ask him, `What profit is it to me, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup> and what do I gain by not sinning?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-4">"I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-5">Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-6">If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-7">If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-8">Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-9">"Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-10">But no one says, `Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-11">who teaches more to us than to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup> the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_4">4</a>]</sup> the birds of the air?'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-12">He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-13">Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-14">How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-15">and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-035-16">So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."</li>
