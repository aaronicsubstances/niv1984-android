 <h3>Job 36</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-1">Elihu continued:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-2">"Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-3">I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-4">Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-5">"God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-6">He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-7">He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-8">But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-9">he tells them what they have done-- that they have sinned arrogantly.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-10">He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-11">If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-12">But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup> and die without knowledge.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-13">"The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-14">They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-15">But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-16">"He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-18">Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-19">Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-20">Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-21">Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-22">"God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-23">Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, `You have done wrong'?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-24">Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-25">All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-26">How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-27">"He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_3">3</a>]</sup> ;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-28">the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-29">Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-30">See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-31">This is the way he governs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_4">4</a>]</sup> the nations and provides food in abundance.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-32">He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-036-33">His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
