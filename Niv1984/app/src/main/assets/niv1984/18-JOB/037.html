 <h3>Job 37</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-1">"At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-2">Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-3">He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-4">After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-5">God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-6">He says to the snow, `Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, `Be a mighty downpour.'</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-7">So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-8">The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-9">The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-10">The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-11">He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-12">At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-13">He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_2">2</a>]</sup> and show his love.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-14">"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-15">Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-16">Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-17">You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-18">can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-19">"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-20">Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-21">Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-22">Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-23">The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-037-24">Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_3">3</a>]</sup> "</li>
