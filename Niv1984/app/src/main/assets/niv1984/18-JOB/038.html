 <h3>Job 38</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-2">"Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-3">Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-4">"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-5">Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-6">On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone--</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-7">while the morning stars sang together and all the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_1">1</a>]</sup> shouted for joy?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-8">"Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-9">when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-10">when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-11">when I said, `This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-12">"Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-13">that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-14">The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-15">The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-16">"Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-17">Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_2">2</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-18">Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-19">"What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-20">Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-21">Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-22">"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-23">which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-24">What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-25">Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-26">to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-27">to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-28">Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-29">From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-30">when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-31">"Can you bind the beautiful <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_3">3</a>]</sup> Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-32">Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_4">4</a>]</sup> or lead out the Bear <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_5">5</a>]</sup> with its cubs?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-33">Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up [God's <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_6">6</a>]</sup> ] dominion over the earth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-34">"Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-35">Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, `Here we are'?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-36">Who endowed the heart <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_7">7</a>]</sup> with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_8">8</a>]</sup> ?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-37">Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-38">when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-39">"Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-40">when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-038-41">Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?</li>
