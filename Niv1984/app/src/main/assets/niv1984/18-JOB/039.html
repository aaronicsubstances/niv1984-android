 <h3>Job 39</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-1">"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-2">Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-3">They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-4">Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-5">"Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-6">I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-7">He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-8">He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-9">"Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-10">Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-11">Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-12">Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-13">"The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-14">She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-15">unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-16">She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-17">for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-18">Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-19">"Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-20">Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-21">He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-22">He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-23">The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-24">In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-25">At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, `Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-26">"Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-27">Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-28">He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-29">From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-039-30">His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."</li>
