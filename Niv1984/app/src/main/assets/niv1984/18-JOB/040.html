 <h3>Job 40</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-1">The LORD said to Job:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-2">"Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-3">Then Job answered the LORD:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-4">"I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-5">I spoke once, but I have no answer-- twice, but I will say no more."</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-6">Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-7">"Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-8">"Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-9">Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-10">Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-11">Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-12">look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-13">Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-14">Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-15">"Look at the behemoth, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_1">1</a>]</sup> which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-16">What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-17">His tail <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_2">2</a>]</sup> sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-19">He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-20">The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-21">Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-22">The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-23">When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-040-24">Can anyone capture him by the eyes, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_3">3</a>]</sup> or trap him and pierce his nose?</li>
