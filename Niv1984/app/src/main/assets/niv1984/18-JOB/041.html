 <h3>Job 41</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-1">"Can you pull in the leviathan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_1">1</a>]</sup> with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-3">Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-4">Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-5">Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-6">Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-9">Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-10">No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-11">Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-12">"I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-14">Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-15">His back has <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_2">2</a>]</sup> rows of shields tightly sealed together;</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-16">each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-17">They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-18">His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-20">Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-22">Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-24">His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-25">When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-27">Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-28">Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-29">A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-31">He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-32">Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-33">Nothing on earth is his equal-- a creature without fear.</li>
  <li id="18-JOB-041-34">He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."</li>
