 <h3>Psalm 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-001-1">Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-2">But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-3">He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-4">Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-5">Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</li>
  <li id="verse-001-6">For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</li>

  <li id="verse-018-41">They cried for help, but there was no one to save them-- to the LORD, but he did not answer.</li>
  <li id="verse-018-42">I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets.</li>
  <li id="verse-018-43">You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me.</li>

 <h3>Psalm 35</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-035-1">Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-2">Take up shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-3">Brandish spear and javelin <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_1">1</a>]</sup> against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."</li>
  <li id="verse-035-4">May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-5">May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;</li>
  <li id="verse-035-6">may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-7">Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,</li>
  <li id="verse-035-8">may ruin overtake them by surprise-- may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-9">Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-10">My whole being will exclaim, "Who is like you, O LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."</li>
  <li id="verse-035-11">Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-12">They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-13">Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</li>
  <li id="verse-035-14">I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-15">But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-16">Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_2">2</a>]</sup> ; they gnashed their teeth at me.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-17">O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-18">I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-19">Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-20">They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-21">They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."</li>
  <li id="verse-035-22">O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-23">Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-24">Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-25">Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."</li>
  <li id="verse-035-26">May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.</li>
  <li id="verse-035-27">May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, "The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."</li>
  <li id="verse-035-28">My tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day long.</li>

 <h3>Psalm 36</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-036-1">An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_1">1</a>]</sup> There is no fear of God before his eyes.</li>
  <li id="verse-036-2">For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.</li>

  <li id="verse-036-4">Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.</li>
  <li id="verse-036-5">Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</li>
  <li id="verse-036-6">Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.</li>
  <li id="verse-036-7">How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_2">2</a>]</sup> refuge in the shadow of your wings.</li>

 <h3>Psalm 37</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-037-1">Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;</li>
  <li id="verse-037-2">for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-3">Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-4">Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.</li>

  <li id="verse-037-8">Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-9">For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-10">A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-11">But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-12">The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</li>

  <li id="verse-037-14">The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-15">But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.</li>
  <li id="verse-037-16">Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</li>

 <h3>Psalm 38</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="verse-038-1">O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-2">For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-3">Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-4">My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.</li>

  <li id="verse-038-11">My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</li>

  <li id="verse-038-14">I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-15">I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-16">For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</li>
  <li id="verse-038-17">For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-18">I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</li>
  <li id="verse-038-19">Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</li>

  <li id="verse-040-1">I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.</li>
  <li id="verse-040-2">He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</li>
  <li id="verse-040-3">He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.</li>

  <li id="verse-040-5">Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.</li>
  <li id="verse-040-6">Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_2">2</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_3">3</a>]</sup> ; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</li>

  <li id="verse-055-5">Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.</li>

  <li id="verse-055-17">Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</li>
  <li id="verse-055-18">He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</li>
  <li id="verse-055-19">God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them-- Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God.</li>

  <li id="verse-069-3">I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.</li>
  <li id="verse-069-4">Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.</li>
  <li id="verse-069-5">You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.</li>
  <li id="verse-069-6">May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="verse-069-7">For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.</li>
  <li id="verse-069-8">I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;</li>

  <li id="verse-078-4">We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-5">He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</li>

  <li id="verse-078-11">They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</li>

  <li id="verse-078-13">He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-14">He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-15">He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-16">he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-17">But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-18">They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</li>

  <li id="verse-078-20">When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</li>
  <li id="verse-078-21">When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</li>
  <li id="verse-078-22">for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-23">Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-24">he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-25">Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</li>

  <li id="verse-078-27">He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-28">He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-29">They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-30">But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</li>
  <li id="verse-078-31">God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-32">In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-33">So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-34">Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-35">They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-36">But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-37">their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-38">Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-39">He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-40">How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</li>
  <li id="verse-078-41">Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-42">They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</li>
  <li id="verse-078-43">the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-44">He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-45">He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-46">He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-47">He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-48">He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-49">He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-50">He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-51">He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-52">But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-53">He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-54">Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-55">He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-56">But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-57">Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-58">They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-59">When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-60">He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-61">He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-62">He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-63">Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-64">their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-65">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-66">He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-67">Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-68">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-69">He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-70">He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</li>
  <li id="verse-078-71">from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="verse-078-72">And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.</li>

  <li id="verse-105-3">Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-4">Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-5">Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</li>
  <li id="verse-105-6">O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-7">He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-8">He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</li>
  <li id="verse-105-9">the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-10">He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</li>
  <li id="verse-105-11">"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."</li>
  <li id="verse-105-12">When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</li>
  <li id="verse-105-13">they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-14">He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</li>
  <li id="verse-105-15">"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</li>
  <li id="verse-105-16">He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</li>
  <li id="verse-105-17">and he sent a man before them-- Joseph, sold as a slave.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-18">They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</li>

  <li id="verse-105-21">He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</li>
  <li id="verse-105-22">to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-23">Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-24">The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</li>
  <li id="verse-105-25">whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-26">He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</li>

  <li id="verse-105-31">He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</li>
  <li id="verse-105-32">He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</li>
  <li id="verse-105-33">he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</li>

  <li id="verse-105-36">Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</li>

  <li id="verse-105-39">He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</li>

  <li id="verse-106-2">Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?</li>
  <li id="verse-106-3">Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-4">Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</li>
  <li id="verse-106-5">that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-6">We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-7">When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="verse-106-8">Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-9">He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-10">He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-11">The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-12">Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-13">But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-14">In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-15">So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-16">In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-17">The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-18">Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-19">At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-20">They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-21">They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</li>
  <li id="verse-106-22">miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-23">So he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</li>

  <li id="verse-106-25">They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-26">So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,</li>
  <li id="verse-106-27">make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-28">They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</li>
  <li id="verse-106-29">they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-30">But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-31">This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-32">By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</li>
  <li id="verse-106-33">for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="verse-106-34">They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,</li>
  <li id="verse-106-35">but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-36">They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-37">They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-38">They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-39">They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</li>

  <li id="verse-106-41">He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-42">Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-43">Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-44">But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</li>
  <li id="verse-106-45">for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-46">He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</li>
  <li id="verse-106-48">Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.</li>
