 <h3>Psalm 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-001-1">Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-001-2">But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-001-3">He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-001-4">Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-001-5">Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-001-6">For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.</li>
