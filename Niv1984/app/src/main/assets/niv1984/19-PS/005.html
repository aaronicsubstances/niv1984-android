 <h3>Psalm 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-005-1">Psalm 5 For the director of music. For flutes. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-2">Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-3">Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-4">In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-5">You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-6">The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-7">You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-8">But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-9">Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies-- make straight your way before me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-10">Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-11">Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-12">But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-005-13">For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.</li>
