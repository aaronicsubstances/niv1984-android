 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-007-1">Psalm 7 A shiggaion <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_1">1</a>]</sup> of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjamite.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-2">O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-3">or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-4">O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-5">if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-6">then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-7">Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-8">Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-9">let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-10">O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-11">My shield <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_2">2</a>]</sup> is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-12">God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-13">If he does not relent, he <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_3">3</a>]</sup> will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-14">He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-15">He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-16">He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-17">The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-007-18">I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</li>
