 <h3>Psalm 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-009-1">Psalm 9 For the director of music. To [the tune of] "The Death of the Son." A psalm of David. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-2">I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-3">I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-4">My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-5">For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-6">You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-7">Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-8">The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-9">He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-10">The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-11">Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-12">Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-13">For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-14">O LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-15">that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-16">The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-17">The LORD is known by his justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_2">2</a>]</sup> Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-18">The wicked return to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_3">3</a>]</sup> all the nations that forget God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-19">But the needy will not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted ever perish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-20">Arise, O LORD, let not man triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-009-21">Strike them with terror, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah</li>
