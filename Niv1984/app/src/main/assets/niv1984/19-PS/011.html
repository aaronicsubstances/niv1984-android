  <li id="19-PS-011-1">Psalm 11 For the director of music. Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-2">In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: "Flee like a bird to your mountain.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-3">For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-4">When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do <sup>[<a href="#footnote_175485287_1">1</a>]</sup> ?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-5">The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men; his eyes examine them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-6">The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked <sup>[<a href="#footnote_175485287_2">2</a>]</sup> and those who love violence his soul hates.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-7">On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-011-8">For the LORD is righteous, he loves justice; upright men will see his face.</li>
