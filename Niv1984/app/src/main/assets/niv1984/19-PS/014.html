 <h3>Psalm 14</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-014-1">Psalm 14 For the director of music. Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-2">The fool <sup>[<a href="#footnote_191951465_1">1</a>]</sup> says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-3">The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-4">All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-5">Will evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-6">There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-7">You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-014-8">Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</li>
