  <li id="19-PS-015-1">Psalm 15 A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-015-2">LORD, who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-015-3">He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from his heart</li>
  <li id="19-PS-015-4">and has no slander on his tongue, who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-015-5">who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his oath even when it hurts,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-015-6">who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.</li>
