 <h3>Psalm 17</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-017-1">Psalm 17 A prayer of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-2">Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer-- it does not rise from deceitful lips.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-3">May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-4">Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-5">As for the deeds of men-- by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-6">My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-7">I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-8">Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-9">Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-10">from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-11">They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-12">They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-13">They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-14">Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-15">O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-017-16">And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.</li>
