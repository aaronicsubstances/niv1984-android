 <h3>Psalm 19</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-019-1">Psalm 19 For the director of music. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-2">The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-3">Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-4">There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_397670913_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-5">Their voice <sup>[<a href="#footnote_397670913_2">2</a>]</sup> goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-6">which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-7">It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-8">The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-9">The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-10">The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-11">They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-12">By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-13">Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-14">Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-019-15">May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.</li>
