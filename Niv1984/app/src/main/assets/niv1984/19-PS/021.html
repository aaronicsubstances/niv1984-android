  <li id="19-PS-021-2">O LORD, the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-3">You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-4">You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-5">He asked you for life, and you gave it to him-- length of days, for ever and ever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-6">Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-7">Surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-8">For the king trusts in the LORD; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-9">Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-10">At the time of your appearing you will make them like a fiery furnace. In his wrath the LORD will swallow them up, and his fire will consume them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-11">You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-12">Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-13">for you will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-021-14">Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength; we will sing and praise your might.</li>
