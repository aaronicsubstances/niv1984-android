 <h3>Psalm 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-022-1">Psalm 22 For the director of music. To [the tune of] "The Doe of the Morning." A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-2">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-3">O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-4">Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-5">In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-6">They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-7">But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-8">All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-9">"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-10">Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-11">From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-12">Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-13">Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-14">Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-15">I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-16">My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_2">2</a>]</sup> in the dust of death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-17">Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_3">3</a>]</sup> my hands and my feet.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-18">I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-19">They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-20">But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-21">Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-22">Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_4">4</a>]</sup> me from the horns of the wild oxen.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-23">I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-24">You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-25">For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-26">From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_5">5</a>]</sup> will I fulfill my vows.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-27">The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the LORD will praise him-- may your hearts live forever!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-28">All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-29">for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-30">All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him-- those who cannot keep themselves alive.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-31">Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-022-32">They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn-- for he has done it.</li>
