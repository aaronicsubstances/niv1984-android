  <li id="19-PS-025-2">To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-3">in you I trust, O my God. Do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-4">No one whose hope is in you will ever be put to shame, but they will be put to shame who are treacherous without excuse.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-5">Show me your ways, O LORD, teach me your paths;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-6">guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-7">Remember, O LORD, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-8">Remember not the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways; according to your love remember me, for you are good, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-9">Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-10">He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-11">All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-12">For the sake of your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-13">Who, then, is the man that fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way chosen for him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-14">He will spend his days in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-15">The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-16">My eyes are ever on the LORD, for only he will release my feet from the snare.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-17">Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-18">The troubles of my heart have multiplied; free me from my anguish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-19">Look upon my affliction and my distress and take away all my sins.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-20">See how my enemies have increased and how fiercely they hate me!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-21">Guard my life and rescue me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-22">May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope is in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-025-23">Redeem Israel, O God, from all their troubles!</li>
