 <h3>Psalm 27</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-027-1">Psalm 27 Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-2">The LORD is my light and my salvation-- whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life-- of whom shall I be afraid?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-3">When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_113339984_1">1</a>]</sup> when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-4">Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-5">One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-6">For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-7">Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-8">Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-9">My heart says of you, "Seek his <sup>[<a href="#footnote_113339984_2">2</a>]</sup> face!" Your face, LORD, I will seek.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-10">Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-11">Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-12">Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-13">Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-14">I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-027-15">Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.</li>
