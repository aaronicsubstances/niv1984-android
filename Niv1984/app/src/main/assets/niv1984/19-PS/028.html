 <h3>Psalm 28</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-028-1">Psalm 28 Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-2">To you I call, O LORD my Rock; do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who have gone down to the pit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-3">Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-4">Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-5">Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-6">Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-7">Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-8">The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-9">The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-028-10">Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</li>
