 <h3>Psalm 31</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-031-1">Psalm 31 For the director of music. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-2">In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-3">Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-4">Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-5">Free me from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-6">Into your hands I commit my spirit; redeem me, O LORD, the God of truth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-7">I hate those who cling to worthless idols; I trust in the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-8">I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-9">You have not handed me over to the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-10">Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and my body with grief.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-11">My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_211693759_1">1</a>]</sup> and my bones grow weak.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-12">Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors; I am a dread to my friends-- those who see me on the street flee from me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-13">I am forgotten by them as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-14">For I hear the slander of many; there is terror on every side; they conspire against me and plot to take my life.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-15">But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, "You are my God."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-16">My times are in your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-17">Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-18">Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and lie silent in the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_211693759_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-19">Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-20">How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you, which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-21">In the shelter of your presence you hide them from the intrigues of men; in your dwelling you keep them safe from accusing tongues.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-22">Praise be to the LORD, for he showed his wonderful love to me when I was in a besieged city.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-23">In my alarm I said, "I am cut off from your sight!" Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-24">Love the LORD, all his saints! The LORD preserves the faithful, but the proud he pays back in full.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-031-25">Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD.</li>
