  <li id="19-PS-032-1">Psalm 32 Of David. A maskil. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_742419354_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-2">Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-3">Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-4">When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-5">For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-6">Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"-- and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-7">Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-8">You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-9">I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-10">Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-11">Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-032-12">Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!</li>
