  <li id="19-PS-033-1">Psalm 33</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-2">Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-3">Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-4">Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-5">For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-6">The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-7">By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-8">He gathers the waters of the sea into jars <sup>[<a href="#footnote_150941098_1">1</a>]</sup> ; he puts the deep into storehouses.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-9">Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-10">For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-11">The LORD foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-12">But the plans of the LORD stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-13">Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-14">From heaven the LORD looks down and sees all mankind;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-15">from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-16">he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-17">No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-18">A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-19">But the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-20">to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-21">We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-22">In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-033-23">May your unfailing love rest upon us, O LORD, even as we put our hope in you.</li>
