 <h3>Psalm 35</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-035-1">Psalm 35 Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-2">Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-3">Take up shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-4">Brandish spear and javelin <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_1">1</a>]</sup> against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-5">May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-6">May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-7">may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-8">Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-9">may ruin overtake them by surprise-- may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-10">Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-11">My whole being will exclaim, "Who is like you, O LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-12">Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-13">They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-14">Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-15">I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-16">But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-17">Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_2">2</a>]</sup> ; they gnashed their teeth at me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-18">O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-19">I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-20">Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-21">They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-22">They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-23">O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-24">Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-25">Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-26">Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-27">May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-28">May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, "The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-035-29">My tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day long.</li>
