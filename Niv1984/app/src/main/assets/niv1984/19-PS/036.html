 <h3>Psalm 36</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-036-1">Psalm 36 For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-2">An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_1">1</a>]</sup> There is no fear of God before his eyes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-3">For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-4">The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-5">Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-6">Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-7">Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-8">How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_2">2</a>]</sup> refuge in the shadow of your wings.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-9">They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-10">For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-11">Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-12">May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-036-13">See how the evildoers lie fallen-- thrown down, not able to rise!</li>
