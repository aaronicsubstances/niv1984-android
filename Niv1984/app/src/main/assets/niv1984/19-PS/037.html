  <li id="19-PS-037-1">Psalm 37 Of David. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-2">Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-3">for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-4">Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-5">Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-6">Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-7">He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-8">Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-9">Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-10">For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-11">A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-12">But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-13">The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-14">but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-15">The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-16">But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-17">Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-18">for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-19">The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-20">In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-21">But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-22">The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-23">those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-24">If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-25">though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-26">I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-27">They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-28">Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-29">For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-30">the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-31">The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-32">The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-33">The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-34">but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-35">Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-36">I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-37">but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-38">Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_2">2</a>]</sup> for the man of peace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-39">But all sinners will be destroyed; the future <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_3">3</a>]</sup> of the wicked will be cut off.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-40">The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-037-41">The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.</li>
