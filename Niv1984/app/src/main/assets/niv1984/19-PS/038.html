 <h3>Psalm 38</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-038-1">Psalm 38 A psalm of David. A petition.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-2">O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-3">For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-4">Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-5">My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-6">My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-7">I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-8">My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-9">I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-10">All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-11">My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-12">My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-13">Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-14">I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-15">I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-16">I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-17">For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-18">For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-19">I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-20">Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-21">Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-22">O LORD, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-038-23">Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.</li>
