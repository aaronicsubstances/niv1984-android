 <h3>Psalm 39</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-039-1">Psalm 39 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-2">I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-3">But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-4">My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-5">"Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-6">You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-7">Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-8">"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-9">Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-10">I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-11">Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-12">You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth-- each man is but a breath. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-13">"Hear my prayer, O LORD, listen to my cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien, a stranger, as all my fathers were.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-039-14">Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more."</li>
