 <h3>Psalm 40</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-040-1">Psalm 40 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-2">I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-3">He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-4">He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-5">Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-6">Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-7">Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_2">2</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_3">3</a>]</sup> ; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-8">Then I said, "Here I am, I have come-- it is written about me in the scroll. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-9">I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-10">I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you know, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-11">I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-12">Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-13">For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-14">Be pleased, O LORD, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-15">May all who seek to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-16">May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" be appalled at their own shame.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-17">But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "The LORD be exalted!"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-040-18">Yet I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.</li>
