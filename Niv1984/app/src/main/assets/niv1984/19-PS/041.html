  <li id="19-PS-041-2">Blessed is he who has regard for the weak; the LORD delivers him in times of trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-3">The LORD will protect him and preserve his life; he will bless him in the land and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-4">The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-5">I said, "O LORD, have mercy on me; heal me, for I have sinned against you."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-6">My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die and his name perish?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-7">Whenever one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it abroad.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-041-9">"A vile disease has beset him; he will never get up from the place where he lies."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-10">Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-11">But you, O LORD, have mercy on me; raise me up, that I may repay them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-12">I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-13">In my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-041-14">Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.</li>
