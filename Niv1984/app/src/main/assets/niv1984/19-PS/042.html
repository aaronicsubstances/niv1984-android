 <h3>Psalm 42</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-042-1">Psalm 42 For the director of music. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_1">1</a>]</sup> of the Sons of Korah. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-2">As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-3">My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-4">My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-5">These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-6">Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-7">my God. My <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_3">3</a>]</sup> soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-8">Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-9">By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me-- a prayer to the God of my life.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-10">I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-11">My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-042-12">Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</li>
