 <h3>Psalm 44</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-044-1">Psalm 44 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-2">We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-3">With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-4">It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-5">You are my King and my God, who decrees <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_2">2</a>]</sup> victories for Jacob.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-6">Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-7">I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-8">but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-9">In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-10">But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-11">You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-12">You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-13">You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-14">You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-15">You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-16">My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-17">at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-18">All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-19">Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-20">But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-21">If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-22">would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-23">Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-24">Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-25">Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-26">We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-044-27">Rise up and help us; redeem us because of your unfailing love.</li>
