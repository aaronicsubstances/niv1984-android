 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-048-1">Psalm 48 A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-2">Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-3">It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup> is Mount Zion, the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_2">2</a>]</sup> city of the Great King.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-4">God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-5">When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-6">they saw [her] and were astounded; they fled in terror.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-7">Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-8">You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-9">As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-10">Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-11">Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-12">Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-13">Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-14">consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-048-15">For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end.</li>
