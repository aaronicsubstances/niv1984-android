 <h3>Psalm 49</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-049-1">Psalm 49 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-2">Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-3">both low and high, rich and poor alike:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-4">My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-5">I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-6">Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-7">those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-8">No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-9">the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-10">that he should live on forever and not see decay.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-11">For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-12">Their tombs will remain their houses <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_1">1</a>]</sup> forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_2">2</a>]</sup> named lands after themselves.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-13">But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_3">3</a>]</sup> like the beasts that perish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-14">This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-15">Like sheep they are destined for the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_4">4</a>]</sup> and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_5">5</a>]</sup> far from their princely mansions.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-16">But God will redeem my life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_6">6</a>]</sup> from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-17">Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-18">for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-19">Though while he lived he counted himself blessed-- and men praise you when you prosper--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-20">he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light [of life].</li>
  <li id="19-PS-049-21">A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.</li>
