 <h3>Psalm 50</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-050-1">Psalm 50 A psalm of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-2">The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-3">From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-4">Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-5">He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-6">"Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-7">And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-8">"Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-9">I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-10">I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-11">for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-12">I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-13">If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-14">Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-15">Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-16">and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-17">But to the wicked, God says: "What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-18">You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-19">When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-20">You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-21">You speak continually against your brother and slander your own mother's son.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-22">These things you have done and I kept silent; you thought I was altogether <sup>[<a href="#footnote_170415707_1">1</a>]</sup> like you. But I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-23">"Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-050-24">He who sacrifices thank offerings honors me, and he prepares the way so that I may show him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_170415707_2">2</a>]</sup> the salvation of God."</li>
