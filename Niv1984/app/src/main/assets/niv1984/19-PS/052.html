 <h3>Psalm 52</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-052-1">Psalm 52 For the director of music. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_24408923_1">1</a>]</sup> of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him: "David has gone to the house of Ahimelech."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-2">Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-3">Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-4">You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-5">You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-6">Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-7">The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at him, saying,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-8">"Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-9">But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-052-10">I will praise you forever for what you have done; in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints.</li>
