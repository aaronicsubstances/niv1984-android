  <li id="19-PS-053-2">The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-053-3">God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-053-4">Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-053-5">Will the evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-053-6">There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-053-7">Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</li>
