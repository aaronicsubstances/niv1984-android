 <h3>Psalm 55</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-055-1">Psalm 55 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup> of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-2">Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-3">hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-4">at the voice of the enemy, at the stares of the wicked; for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-5">My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death assail me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-6">Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-7">I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-8">I would flee far away and stay in the desert; Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-9">I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-10">Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-11">Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-12">Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-13">If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were raising himself against me, I could hide from him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-14">But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-15">with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-16">Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup> for evil finds lodging among them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-17">But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-18">Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-19">He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-20">God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them-- Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-21">My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-22">His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-23">Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-055-24">But you, O God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption; bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.</li>
