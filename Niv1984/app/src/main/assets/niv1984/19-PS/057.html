  <li id="19-PS-057-2">Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-057-3">I cry out to God Most High, to God, who fulfills [his purpose] for me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-057-4">He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me; Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-057-5">I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts-- men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</li>
