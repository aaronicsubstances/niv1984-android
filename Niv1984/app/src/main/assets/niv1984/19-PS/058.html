 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-058-1">Psalm 58 For the director of music. [To the tune of] "Do Not Destroy." Of David. A miktam. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-2">Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-3">No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-4">Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-5">Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-6">that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-7">Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O LORD, the fangs of the lions!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-8">Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-9">Like a slug melting away as it moves along, like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-10">Before your pots can feel [the heat of] the thorns-- whether they be green or dry--the wicked will be swept away. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-11">The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-058-12">Then men will say, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth."</li>
