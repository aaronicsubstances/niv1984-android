 <h3>Psalm 59</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-059-1">Psalm 59 For the director of music. [To the tune of] "Do Not Destroy." Of David. A miktam. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup> When Saul had sent men to watch David's house in order to kill him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-2">Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-3">Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-4">See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-5">I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-6">O LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-7">They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-8">See what they spew from their mouths-- they spew out swords from their lips, and they say, "Who can hear us?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-9">But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-10">O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O God, are my fortress,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-11">my loving God. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-12">But do not kill them, O Lord our shield, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup> or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about, and bring them down.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-13">For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-14">consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-15">They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-16">They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-17">But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-059-18">O my Strength, I sing praise to you; you, O God, are my fortress, my loving God.</li>
