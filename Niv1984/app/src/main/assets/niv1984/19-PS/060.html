 <h3>Psalm 60</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-060-1">Psalm 60 For the director of music. To [the tune of] "The Lily of the Covenant." A miktam <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup> of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup> and Aram Zobah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_3">3</a>]</sup> and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-2">You have rejected us, O God, and burst forth upon us; you have been angry--now restore us!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-3">You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-4">You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-5">But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-6">Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-7">God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-8">Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-9">Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-10">Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-11">Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-12">Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-060-13">With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.</li>
