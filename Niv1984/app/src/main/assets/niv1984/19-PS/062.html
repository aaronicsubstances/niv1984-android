 <h3>Psalm 62</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-062-1">Psalm 62 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-2">My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-3">He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-4">How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down-- this leaning wall, this tottering fence?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-5">They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-6">Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-7">He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-8">My salvation and my honor depend on God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_1">1</a>]</sup> ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-9">Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-10">Lowborn men are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-11">Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-12">One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard: that you, O God, are strong,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-062-13">and that you, O Lord, are loving. Surely you will reward each person according to what he has done.</li>
