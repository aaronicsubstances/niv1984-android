  <li id="19-PS-063-2">O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-3">I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-4">Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-5">I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-6">My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-7">On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-063-9">My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-10">They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-11">They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-063-12">But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God's name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.</li>
