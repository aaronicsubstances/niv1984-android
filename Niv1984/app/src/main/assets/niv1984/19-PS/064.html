 <h3>Psalm 64</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-064-1">Psalm 64 For the director of music. A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-2">Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-3">Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-4">They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-5">They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-6">They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see them <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup> ?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-7">They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-8">But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-9">He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-10">All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-064-11">Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him!</li>
