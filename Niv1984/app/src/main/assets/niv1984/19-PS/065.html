 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-065-1">Psalm 65 For the director of music. A psalm of David. A song.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-2">Praise awaits <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_1">1</a>]</sup> you, O God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-3">O you who hear prayer, to you all men will come.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-4">When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_2">2</a>]</sup> our transgressions.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-5">Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-6">You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness, O God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-7">who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-8">who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-9">Those living far away fear your wonders; where morning dawns and evening fades you call forth songs of joy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-10">You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-11">You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-12">You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-13">The grasslands of the desert overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-065-14">The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.</li>
