 <h3>Psalm 66</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-066-1">Psalm 66 For the director of music. A song. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-2">Shout with joy to God, all the earth!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-3">Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-4">Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-5">All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing praise to your name." Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-6">Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works in man's behalf!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-7">He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot-- come, let us rejoice in him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-8">He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations-- let not the rebellious rise up against him. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-9">Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-10">he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-11">For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-12">You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-13">You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-14">I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-15">vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-16">I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-17">Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-18">I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-19">If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-20">but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-066-21">Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!</li>
