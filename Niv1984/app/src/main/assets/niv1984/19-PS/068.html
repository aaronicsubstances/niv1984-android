 <h3>Psalm 68</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-068-1">Psalm 68 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. A song.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-2">May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-3">As smoke is blown away by the wind, may you blow them away; as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-4">But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-5">Sing to God, sing praise to his name, extol him who rides on the clouds <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup> -- his name is the LORD-- and rejoice before him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-6">A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-7">God sets the lonely in families, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup> he leads forth the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-8">When you went out before your people, O God, when you marched through the wasteland, Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-9">the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-10">You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-11">Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, O God, you provided for the poor.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-12">The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-13">"Kings and armies flee in haste; in the camps men divide the plunder.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-14">Even while you sleep among the campfires, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup> the wings of [my] dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-15">When the Almighty <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_4">4</a>]</sup> scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Zalmon.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-16">The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains; rugged are the mountains of Bashan.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-17">Why gaze in envy, O rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the LORD himself will dwell forever?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-18">The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord [has come] from Sinai into his sanctuary.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-19">When you ascended on high, you led captives in your train; you received gifts from men, even from <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_5">5</a>]</sup> the rebellious-- that you, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_6">6</a>]</sup> O LORD God, might dwell there.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-20">Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-21">Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-22">Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-23">The Lord says, "I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-24">that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-25">Your procession has come into view, O God, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-26">In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the maidens playing tambourines.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-27">Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-28">There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah's princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-29">Summon your power, O God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_7">7</a>]</sup> ; show us your strength, O God, as you have done before.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-30">Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-31">Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-32">Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_8">8</a>]</sup> will submit herself to God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-33">Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-34">to him who rides the ancient skies above, who thunders with mighty voice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-35">Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-068-36">You are awesome, O God, in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!</li>
