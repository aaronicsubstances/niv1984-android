 <h3>Psalm 69</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-069-1">Psalm 69 For the director of music. To [the tune of] "Lilies." Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-2">Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-3">I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-4">I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-5">Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-6">You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-7">May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-8">For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-9">I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-10">for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-11">When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-12">when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-13">Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-14">But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-15">Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-16">Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-17">Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-18">Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-19">Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-20">You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-21">Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-22">They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-23">May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup> a trap.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-24">May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-25">Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-26">May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-27">For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-28">Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-29">May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-30">I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-31">I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-32">This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-33">The poor will see and be glad-- you who seek God, may your hearts live!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-34">The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-35">Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-36">for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-069-37">the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.</li>
