  <li id="19-PS-071-2">In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-3">Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-4">Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-5">Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-6">For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-7">From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-8">I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-9">My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-10">Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-11">For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-12">They say, "God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-13">Be not far from me, O God; come quickly, O my God, to help me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-14">May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-15">But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-16">My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-17">I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD; I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-18">Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-19">Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-20">Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-21">Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-22">You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-23">I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-24">My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you-- I, whom you have redeemed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-071-25">My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.</li>
