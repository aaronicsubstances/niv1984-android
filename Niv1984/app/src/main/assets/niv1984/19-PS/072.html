  <li id="19-PS-072-1">Psalm 72 Of Solomon.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-2">Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-3">He will <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_1">1</a>]</sup> judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-4">The mountains will bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-5">He will defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; he will crush the oppressor.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-6">He will endure <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_2">2</a>]</sup> as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-7">He will be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-8">In his days the righteous will flourish; prosperity will abound till the moon is no more.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-9">He will rule from sea to sea and from the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_3">3</a>]</sup> to the ends of the earth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_4">4</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-10">The desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-11">The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-12">All kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-13">For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-14">He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-15">He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-16">Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-17">Let grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-18">May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-19">Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-20">Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-072-21">This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.</li>
