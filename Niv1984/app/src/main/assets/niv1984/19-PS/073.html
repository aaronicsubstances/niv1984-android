 <h3>Psalm 73</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-073-1">Psalm 73 A psalm of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-2">Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-3">But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-4">For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-5">They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-6">They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-7">Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-8">From their callous hearts comes iniquity <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_2">2</a>]</sup> ; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-9">They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-10">Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-11">Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-12">They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-13">This is what the wicked are like-- always carefree, they increase in wealth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-14">Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-15">All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-16">If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-17">When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-18">till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-19">Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-20">How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-21">As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-22">When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-23">I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-24">Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-25">You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-26">Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-27">My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-28">Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-073-29">But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.</li>
