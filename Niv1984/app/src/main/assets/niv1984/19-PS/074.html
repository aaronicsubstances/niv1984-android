  <li id="19-PS-074-1">Psalm 74 A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_1">1</a>]</sup> of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-2">Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-3">Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed-- Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-4">Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-5">Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-6">They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-7">They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-8">They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-9">They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-10">We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-11">How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-12">Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-13">But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-14">It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-15">It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-16">It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-17">The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-18">It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-19">Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-20">Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-21">Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-22">Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-23">Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-074-24">Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.</li>
