 <h3>Psalm 75</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-075-1">Psalm 75 For the director of music. [To the tune of] "Do Not Destroy." A psalm of Asaph. A song.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-2">We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near; men tell of your wonderful deeds.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-3">You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-4">When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-5">To the arrogant I say, `Boast no more,' and to the wicked, `Do not lift up your horns.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-6">Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak with outstretched neck.'"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-7">No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-8">But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-9">In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-10">As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-075-11">I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</li>
