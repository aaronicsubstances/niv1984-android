 <h3>Psalm 77</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-077-1">Psalm 77 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-2">I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-3">When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-4">I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-5">You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-6">I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-7">I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-8">"Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-9">Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-10">Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-11">Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right hand of the Most High."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-12">I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-13">I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-14">Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-15">You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-16">With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-17">The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-18">The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-19">Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-20">Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-077-21">You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</li>
