  <li id="19-PS-078-1">Psalm 78 A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup> of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-2">O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-3">I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-4">what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-5">We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-6">He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-7">so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-8">Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-9">They would not be like their forefathers-- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-10">The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-11">they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-12">They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-13">He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-14">He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-15">He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-16">He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-17">he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-18">But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-19">They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-20">They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-21">When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-22">When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-23">for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-24">Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-25">he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-26">Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-27">He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-28">He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-29">He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-30">They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-31">But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-32">God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-33">In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-34">So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-35">Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-36">They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-37">But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-38">their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-39">Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-40">He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-41">How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-42">Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-43">They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-44">the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-45">He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-46">He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-47">He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-48">He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-49">He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-50">He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-51">He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-52">He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-53">But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-54">He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-55">Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-56">He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-57">But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-58">Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-59">They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-60">When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-61">He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-62">He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-63">He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-64">Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-65">their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-66">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-67">He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-68">Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-69">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-70">He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-71">He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-72">from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-078-73">And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.</li>
