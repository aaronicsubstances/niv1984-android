 <h3>Psalm 79</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-079-1">Psalm 79 A psalm of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-2">O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-3">They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-4">They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-5">We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-6">How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-7">Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-8">for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-9">Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-10">Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-11">Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-12">May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-13">Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-079-14">Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.</li>
