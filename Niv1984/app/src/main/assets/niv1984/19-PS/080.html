 <h3>Psalm 80</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-080-1">Psalm 80 For the director of music. To [the tune of] "The Lilies of the Covenant." Of Asaph. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-2">Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-3">before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-4">Restore us, O God; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-5">O LORD God Almighty, how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-6">You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-7">You have made us a source of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-8">Restore us, O God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-9">You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-10">You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-11">The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-12">It sent out its boughs to the Sea, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup> its shoots as far as the River. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-13">Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-14">Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-15">Return to us, O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-16">the root your right hand has planted, the son <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_3">3</a>]</sup> you have raised up for yourself.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-17">Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-18">Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-19">Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-080-20">Restore us, O LORD God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved.</li>
