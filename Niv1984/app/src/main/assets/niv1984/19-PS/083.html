  <li id="19-PS-083-1">Psalm 83 A song. A psalm of Asaph.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-2">O God, do not keep silent; be not quiet, O God, be not still.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-3">See how your enemies are astir, how your foes rear their heads.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-4">With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-5">"Come," they say, "let us destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-6">With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-7">the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-8">Gebal, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup> Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-9">Even Assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of Lot. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-10">Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-11">who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-12">Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-13">who said, "Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-14">Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-15">As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-16">so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-17">Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-18">May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-083-19">Let them know that you, whose name is the LORD-- that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.</li>
