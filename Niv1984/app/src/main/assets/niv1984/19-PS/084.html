  <li id="19-PS-084-2">How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-084-3">My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-084-4">Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young-- a place near your altar, O LORD Almighty, my King and my God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-084-5">Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-084-6">Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-084-7">As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
