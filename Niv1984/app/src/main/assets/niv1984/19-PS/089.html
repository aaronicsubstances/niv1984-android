  <li id="19-PS-089-1">Psalm 89 A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup> of Ethan the Ezrahite.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-2">I will sing of the LORD's great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-3">I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-4">You said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-5">`I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.'" Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-6">The heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-7">For who in the skies above can compare with the LORD? Who is like the LORD among the heavenly beings?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-8">In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-9">O LORD God Almighty, who is like you? You are mighty, O LORD, and your faithfulness surrounds you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-10">You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-11">You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-12">The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-13">You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-14">Your arm is endued with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-15">Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-16">Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-17">They rejoice in your name all day long; they exult in your righteousness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-18">For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-19">Indeed, our shield <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup> belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-20">Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: "I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have exalted a young man from among the people.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-21">I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-22">My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-23">No enemy will subject him to tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-24">I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-25">My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_4">4</a>]</sup> will be exalted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-26">I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-27">He will call out to me, `You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.'</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-28">I will also appoint him my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-29">I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-30">I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-31">"If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-32">if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-33">I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-34">but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-35">I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-36">Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness-- and I will not lie to David--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-37">that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-38">it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky." Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-39">But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-40">You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-41">You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-42">All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-43">You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-44">You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-45">You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-46">You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-47">How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-48">Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all men!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-49">What man can live and not see death, or save himself from the power of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_5">5</a>]</sup> ? Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-50">O Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-51">Remember, Lord, how your servant has <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_6">6</a>]</sup> been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-52">the taunts with which your enemies have mocked, O LORD, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-089-53">Praise be to the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.</li>
