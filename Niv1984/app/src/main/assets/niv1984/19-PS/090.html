 <h3>Psalm 90</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-090-1">Psalm 90 A prayer of Moses the man of God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-2">Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-3">Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-4">You turn men back to dust, saying, "Return to dust, O sons of men."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-5">For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-6">You sweep men away in the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of the morning--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-7">though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is dry and withered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-8">We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-9">You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-10">All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-11">The length of our days is seventy years-- or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup> is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-12">Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-13">Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-14">Relent, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-15">Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-16">Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-17">May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-090-18">May the favor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup> of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us-- yes, establish the work of our hands.</li>
