  <li id="19-PS-091-2">He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-3">I will say <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_2">2</a>]</sup> of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-4">Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-5">He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-6">You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-7">nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-8">A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-9">You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-10">If you make the Most High your dwelling-- even the LORD, who is my refuge--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-11">then no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-12">For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-13">they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-14">You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-15">"Because he loves me," says the LORD, "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-16">He will call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-091-17">With long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation."</li>
