 <h3>Psalm 92</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-092-1">Psalm 92 A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-2">It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-3">to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-4">to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-5">For you make me glad by your deeds, O LORD; I sing for joy at the works of your hands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-6">How great are your works, O LORD, how profound your thoughts!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-7">The senseless man does not know, fools do not understand,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-8">that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-9">But you, O LORD, are exalted forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-10">For surely your enemies, O LORD, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-11">You have exalted my horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_1">1</a>]</sup> like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured upon me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-12">My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-13">The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-14">planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-15">They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-092-16">proclaiming, "The LORD is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him."</li>
