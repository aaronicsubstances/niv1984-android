  <li id="19-PS-093-2">The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and is armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-093-3">Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-093-4">The seas have lifted up, O LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-093-6">Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O LORD.</li>
