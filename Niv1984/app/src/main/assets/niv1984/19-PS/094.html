  <li id="19-PS-094-2">O LORD, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-3">Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-4">How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked be jubilant?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-5">They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-6">They crush your people, O LORD; they oppress your inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-7">They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-8">They say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-9">Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-10">Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-11">Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-12">The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-13">Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-14">you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-15">For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-16">Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-17">Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-18">Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-19">When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O LORD, supported me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-20">When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-21">Can a corrupt throne be allied with you-- one that brings on misery by its decrees?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-22">They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-23">But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-094-24">He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them.</li>
