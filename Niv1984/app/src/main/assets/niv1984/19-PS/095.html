 <h3>Psalm 95</h3>

  <li id="19-PS-095-1">Psalm 95</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-2">Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-3">Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-4">For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-5">In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-6">The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-7">Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-8">for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if you hear his voice,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-9">do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_1">1</a>]</sup> as you did that day at Massah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_2">2</a>]</sup> in the desert,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-10">where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-11">For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-095-12">So I declared on oath in my anger, "They shall never enter my rest."</li>
