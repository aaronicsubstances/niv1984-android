  <li id="19-PS-097-2">The LORD reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-3">Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-4">Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-5">His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-6">The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-7">The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-8">All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols-- worship him, all you gods!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-9">Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-10">For you, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-097-11">Let those who love the LORD hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-097-13">Rejoice in the LORD, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.</li>
