 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-101-1">Psalm 101 Of David. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-2">I will sing of your love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing praise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-3">I will be careful to lead a blameless life-- when will you come to me? I will walk in my house with blameless heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-4">I will set before my eyes no vile thing. The deeds of faithless men I hate; they will not cling to me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-5">Men of perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with evil.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-6">Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, him will I not endure.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-7">My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he whose walk is blameless will minister to me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-8">No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-101-9">Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.</li>
