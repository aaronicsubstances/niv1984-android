 <h3>Psalm 102</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-102-1">Psalm 102 A prayer of an afflicted man. When he is faint and pours out his lament before the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-2">Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-3">Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-4">For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-5">My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-6">Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-7">I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-8">I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-9">All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-10">For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-11">because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-12">My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-13">But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-14">You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-15">For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-16">The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-17">For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-18">He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-19">Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-20">"The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-21">to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-22">So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-23">when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-24">In the course of my life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_1">1</a>]</sup> he broke my strength; he cut short my days.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-25">So I said: "Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-26">In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-27">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-28">But you remain the same, and your years will never end.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-102-29">The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you."</li>
