 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-103-1">Psalm 103 Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-2">Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-3">Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-4">who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-5">who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-6">who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-7">The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-8">He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-9">The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-10">He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-11">he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-12">For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-13">as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-14">As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-15">for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-16">As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-17">the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-18">But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD's love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-19">with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-20">The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-21">Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-22">Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-103-23">Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</li>
