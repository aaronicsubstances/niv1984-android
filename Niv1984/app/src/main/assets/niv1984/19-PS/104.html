  <li id="19-PS-104-1">Psalm 104</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-2">Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-3">He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-4">and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-5">He makes winds his messengers, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_1">1</a>]</sup> flames of fire his servants.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-6">He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-7">You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-8">But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-9">they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-10">You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-11">He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-12">They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-13">The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-14">He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-15">He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate-- bringing forth food from the earth:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-16">wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-17">The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-18">There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-19">The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-20">The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-21">You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-22">The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-23">The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-24">Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-25">How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-26">There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-27">There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-28">These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-29">When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-30">When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-31">When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-32">May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-33">he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-34">I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-35">May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-104-36">But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
