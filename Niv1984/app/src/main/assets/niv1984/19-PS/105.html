 <h3>Psalm 105</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-105-1">Psalm 105</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-2">Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-3">Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-4">Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-5">Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-6">Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-7">O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-8">He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-9">He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-10">the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-11">He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-12">"To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-13">When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-14">they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-15">He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-16">"Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-17">He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-18">and he sent a man before them-- Joseph, sold as a slave.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-19">They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-20">till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-21">The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-22">He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-23">to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-24">Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-25">The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-26">whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-27">He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-28">They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-29">He sent darkness and made the land dark-- for had they not rebelled against his words?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-30">He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-31">Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-32">He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-33">He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-34">he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-35">He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-36">they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-37">Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-38">He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-39">Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-40">He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-41">They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-42">He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-43">For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-44">He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-45">he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-105-46">that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_14832045_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
