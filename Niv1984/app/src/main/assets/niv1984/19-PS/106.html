  <li id="19-PS-106-1">Psalm 106</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-2">Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_1">1</a>]</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-3">Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-4">Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-5">Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-6">that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-7">We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-8">When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-9">Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-10">He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-11">He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-12">The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-13">Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-14">But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-15">In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-16">So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-17">In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-18">The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-19">Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-20">At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-21">They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-22">They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-23">miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-24">So he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-25">Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-26">They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-27">So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-28">make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-29">They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-30">they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-31">But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-32">This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-33">By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-34">for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-35">They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-36">but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-37">They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-38">They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-39">They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-40">They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-41">Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-42">He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-43">Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-44">Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-45">But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-46">for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-47">He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-48">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-106-49">Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD.</li>
