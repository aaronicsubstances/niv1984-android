 <h3>Psalm 107</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-107-1">Psalm 107</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-2">Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-3">Let the redeemed of the LORD say this-- those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-4">those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_480841182_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-5">Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-6">They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-7">Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-8">He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-9">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-10">for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-11">Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-12">for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-13">So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-14">Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-15">He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-16">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-17">for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-18">Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-19">They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-20">Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-21">He sent forth his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-22">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-23">Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-24">Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-25">They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-26">For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-27">They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-28">They reeled and staggered like drunken men; they were at their wits' end.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-29">Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-30">He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-31">They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-32">Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-33">Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-34">He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-35">and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-36">He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-37">there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-38">They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-39">he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-40">Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-41">he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-42">But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-43">The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-107-44">Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the LORD.</li>
