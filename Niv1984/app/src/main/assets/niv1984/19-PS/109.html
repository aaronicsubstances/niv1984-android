 <h3>Psalm 109</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-109-1">Psalm 109 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-2">O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-3">for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-4">With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-5">In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-6">They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-7">Appoint <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_1">1</a>]</sup> an evil man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_2">2</a>]</sup> to oppose him; let an accuser <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_3">3</a>]</sup> stand at his right hand.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-8">When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-9">May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-10">May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-11">May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_4">4</a>]</sup> from their ruined homes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-12">May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-13">May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-14">May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-15">May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-16">May their sins always remain before the LORD, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-17">For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-18">He loved to pronounce a curse-- may it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_5">5</a>]</sup> come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing-- may it be <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_6">6</a>]</sup> far from him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-19">He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-20">May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-21">May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-22">But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-23">For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-24">I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-25">My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-26">I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-27">Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-28">Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-29">They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-30">My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-31">With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-109-32">For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him.</li>
