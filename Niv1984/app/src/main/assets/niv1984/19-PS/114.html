  <li id="19-PS-114-1">Psalm 114</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-2">When Israel came out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-3">Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-4">The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-5">the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-6">Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-7">you mountains, that you skipped like rams, you hills, like lambs?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-8">Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-114-9">who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.</li>
