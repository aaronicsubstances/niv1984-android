  <li id="19-PS-115-1">Psalm 115</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-2">Not to us, O LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-3">Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-4">Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-5">But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-6">They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-7">they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-8">they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-9">Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-10">O house of Israel, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-11">O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-12">You who fear him, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-13">The LORD remembers us and will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-14">he will bless those who fear the LORD-- small and great alike.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-15">May the LORD make you increase, both you and your children.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-16">May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-17">The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to man.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-18">It is not the dead who praise the LORD, those who go down to silence;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-115-19">it is we who extol the LORD, both now and forevermore. Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192599806_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
