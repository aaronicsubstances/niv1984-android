  <li id="19-PS-123-1">Psalm 123 A song of ascents.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-123-2">I lift up my eyes to you, to you whose throne is in heaven.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-123-3">As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till he shows us his mercy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-123-4">Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-123-5">We have endured much ridicule from the proud, much contempt from the arrogant.</li>
