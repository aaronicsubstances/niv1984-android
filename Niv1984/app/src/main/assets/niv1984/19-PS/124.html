  <li id="19-PS-124-2">If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel say--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-3">if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-4">when their anger flared against us, they would have swallowed us alive;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-5">the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-6">the raging waters would have swept us away.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-7">Praise be to the LORD, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-8">We have escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-124-9">Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.</li>
