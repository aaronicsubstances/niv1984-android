  <li id="19-PS-127-2">Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-127-3">In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat-- for he grants sleep to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_1">1</a>]</sup> those he loves.</li>
