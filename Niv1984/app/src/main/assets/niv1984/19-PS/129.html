  <li id="19-PS-129-1">Psalm 129 A song of ascents.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-2">They have greatly oppressed me from my youth-- let Israel say--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-3">they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-4">Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-5">But the LORD is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-129-7">May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-8">with it the reaper cannot fill his hands, nor the one who gathers fill his arms.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-129-9">May those who pass by not say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."</li>
