  <li id="19-PS-133-1">Psalm 133 A song of ascents. Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-133-2">How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-133-3">It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron's beard, down upon the collar of his robes.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-133-4">It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.</li>
