  <li id="19-PS-135-3">you who minister in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-4">Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-5">For the LORD has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-6">I know that the LORD is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-7">The LORD does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-8">He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-9">He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of men and animals.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-10">He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-11">He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-12">Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan and all the kings of Canaan--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-13">and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-14">Your name, O LORD, endures forever, your renown, O LORD, through all generations.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-135-17">They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-18">they have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-19">Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-20">O house of Israel, praise the LORD; O house of Aaron, praise the LORD;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-21">O house of Levi, praise the LORD; you who fear him, praise the LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-135-22">Praise be to the LORD from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.</li>
