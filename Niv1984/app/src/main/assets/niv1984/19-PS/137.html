  <li id="19-PS-137-1">Psalm 137</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-2">By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-3">There on the poplars we hung our harps,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-4">for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-5">How can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-6">If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget [its skill].</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-7">May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-8">Remember, O LORD, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. "Tear it down," they cried, "tear it down to its foundations!"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-9">O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us--</li>
  <li id="19-PS-137-10">he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</li>
