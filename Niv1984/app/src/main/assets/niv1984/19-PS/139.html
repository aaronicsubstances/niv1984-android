 <h3>Psalm 139</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="19-PS-139-1">Psalm 139 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-2">O LORD, you have searched me and you know me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-3">You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-4">You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-5">Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-6">You hem me in--behind and before; you have laid your hand upon me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-7">Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-8">Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-9">If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_1">1</a>]</sup> you are there.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-10">If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-11">even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-12">If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,"</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-13">even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-14">For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-15">I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-16">My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-17">your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-18">How precious to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_2">2</a>]</sup> me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-19">Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-20">If only you would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-21">They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-22">Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-23">I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-24">Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-139-25">See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</li>
