  <li id="19-PS-140-2">Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; protect me from men of violence,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-3">who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-4">They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-5">Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from men of violence who plan to trip my feet.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-6">Proud men have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-7">O LORD, I say to you, "You are my God." Hear, O LORD, my cry for mercy.</li>

  <li id="19-PS-140-9">do not grant the wicked their desires, O LORD; do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-10">Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-11">Let burning coals fall upon them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-12">Let slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down men of violence.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-140-13">I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy.</li>
