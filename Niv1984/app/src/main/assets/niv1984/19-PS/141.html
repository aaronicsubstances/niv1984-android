  <li id="19-PS-141-1">Psalm 141 A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-2">O LORD, I call to you; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-3">May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-4">Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-5">Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers; let me not eat of their delicacies.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-6">Let a righteous man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_878711724_1">1</a>]</sup> strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-7">their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-8">[They will say,] "As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_878711724_2">2</a>]</sup> "</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-9">But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge--do not give me over to death.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-10">Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, from the traps set by evildoers.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-141-11">Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.</li>
