  <li id="19-PS-142-1">Psalm 142 A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_572359874_1">1</a>]</sup> of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-2">I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-3">I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-4">When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-5">Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-6">I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-7">Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-142-8">Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.</li>
