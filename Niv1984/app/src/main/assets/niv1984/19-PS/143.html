  <li id="19-PS-143-1">Psalm 143 A psalm of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-2">O LORD, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-3">Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-4">The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-5">So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-6">I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-7">I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-8">Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-9">Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-10">Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-11">Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-12">For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-143-13">In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.</li>
