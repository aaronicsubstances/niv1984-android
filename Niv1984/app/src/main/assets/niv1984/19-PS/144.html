  <li id="19-PS-144-1">Psalm 144 Of David.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-2">Praise be to the LORD my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-3">He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_1">1</a>]</sup> under me.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-4">O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him?</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-5">Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-6">Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-7">Send forth lightning and scatter [the enemies]; shoot your arrows and rout them.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-8">Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-9">whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-10">I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-11">to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-12">Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-13">Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-14">Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-15">our oxen will draw heavy loads. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_2">2</a>]</sup> There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.</li>
  <li id="19-PS-144-16">Blessed are the people of whom this is true; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.</li>
