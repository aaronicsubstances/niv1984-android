 <h3>Proverbs 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-1">The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-2">for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-3">for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-4">for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-5">let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance--</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-6">for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_1">1</a>]</sup> despise wisdom and discipline.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-8">Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-9">They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-11">If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-12">let's swallow them alive, like the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_2">2</a>]</sup> and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-13">we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-14">throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse"--</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-15">my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-16">for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-17">How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-18">These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-19">Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-21">at the head of the noisy streets <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_3">3</a>]</sup> she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech:</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-22">"How long will you simple ones <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_4">4</a>]</sup> love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-23">If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-24">But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-25">since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-26">I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you--</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-27">when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-28">"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-29">Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-30">since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-31">they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-32">For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-001-33">but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."</li>
