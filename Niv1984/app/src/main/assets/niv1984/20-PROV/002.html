 <h3>Proverbs 2</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-1">My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-2">turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-3">and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-4">and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-6">For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-7">He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-8">for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-9">Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-10">For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-11">Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-12">Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-13">who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-14">who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-15">whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-16">It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-17">who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_194399283_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-18">For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-19">None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-20">Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-21">For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-002-22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.</li>
