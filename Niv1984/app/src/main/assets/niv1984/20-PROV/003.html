 <h3>Proverbs 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-2">for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-3">Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-4">Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-6">in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-7">Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-8">This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-9">Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-10">then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline and do not resent his rebuke,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-12">because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_2">2</a>]</sup> the son he delights in.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-13">Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-14">for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-15">She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-17">Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-18">She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-19">By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-20">by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-21">My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-22">they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-23">Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-24">when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-25">Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-27">Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"-- when you now have it with you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-29">Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-30">Do not accuse a man for no reason-- when he has done you no harm.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-31">Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-32">for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-34">He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-003-35">The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.</li>
