 <h3>Proverbs 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-2">that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-4">but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-5">Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-6">She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-7">Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-8">Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-9">lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-10">lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-11">At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-12">You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-13">I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-15">Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-16">Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-17">Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-18">May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-19">A loving doe, a graceful deer-- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-20">Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-21">For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-22">The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-005-23">He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.</li>
