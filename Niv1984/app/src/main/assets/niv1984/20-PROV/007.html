 <h3>Proverbs 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-1">My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-2">Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-3">Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your kinsman;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-5">they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-6">At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-7">I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-8">He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-9">at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-10">Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-11">(She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-12">now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-13">She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said:</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-14">"I have fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_1">1</a>]</sup> at home; today I fulfilled my vows.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-15">So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-16">I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-18">Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-19">My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-20">He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon."</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-21">With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-22">All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_2">2</a>]</sup> stepping into a noose <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-23">till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-24">Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-25">Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-26">Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-007-27">Her house is a highway to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_4">4</a>]</sup> leading down to the chambers of death.</li>
