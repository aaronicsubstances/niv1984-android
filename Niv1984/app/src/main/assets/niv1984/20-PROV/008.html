 <h3>Proverbs 8</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-1">Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-2">On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-3">beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-4">"To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-5">You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-6">Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-7">My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-8">All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-9">To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-10">Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-11">for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-12">"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-13">To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-14">Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-15">By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-16">by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-18">With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-19">My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-20">I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-21">bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-22">"The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_2">2</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_3">3</a>]</sup> before his deeds of old;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-23">I was appointed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_4">4</a>]</sup> from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-24">When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-25">before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-26">before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-27">I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-28">when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-29">when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-30">Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-31">rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-32">"Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-33">Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-35">For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-008-36">But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."</li>
