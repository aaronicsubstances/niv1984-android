  <li id="20-PROV-009-1">Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-2">She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-3">She has sent out her maids, and she calls from the highest point of the city.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-4">"Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-5">"Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-6">Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-7">"Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-8">Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-009-9">Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning.</li>
