  <li id="20-PROV-019-7">A poor man is shunned by all his relatives-- how much more do his friends avoid him! Though he pursues them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146641711_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="20-PROV-019-8">He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; he who cherishes understanding prospers.</li>
