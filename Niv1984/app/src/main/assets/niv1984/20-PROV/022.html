 <h3>Proverbs 22</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-1">A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-2">Rich and poor have this in common: The LORD is the Maker of them all.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-3">A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-4">Humility and the fear of the LORD bring wealth and honor and life.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-5">In the paths of the wicked lie thorns and snares, but he who guards his soul stays far from them.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-6">Train <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162812305_1">1</a>]</sup> a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-7">The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-8">He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-9">A generous man will himself be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-10">Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended.</li>

  <li id="20-PROV-022-12">The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-13">The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!" or, "I will be murdered in the streets!"</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-14">The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the LORD's wrath will fall into it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-15">Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-16">He who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich--both come to poverty.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-17">Pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-18">for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-19">So that your trust may be in the LORD, I teach you today, even you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-20">Have I not written thirty <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162812305_2">2</a>]</sup> sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-21">teaching you true and reliable words, so that you can give sound answers to him who sent you?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-022-22">Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court,</li>

  <li id="20-PROV-022-24">Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered,</li>
