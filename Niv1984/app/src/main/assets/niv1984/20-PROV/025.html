  <li id="20-PROV-025-7">it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman. What you have seen with your eyes</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-8">do not bring <sup>[<a href="#footnote_179795029_2">2</a>]</sup> hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-9">If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-10">or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-11">A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-12">Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear.</li>

  <li id="20-PROV-025-17">Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house-- too much of you, and he will hate you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-18">Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-19">Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-20">Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-21">If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-22">In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-23">As a north wind brings rain, so a sly tongue brings angry looks.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-24">Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-025-25">Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.</li>

  <li id="20-PROV-025-27">It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor.</li>
