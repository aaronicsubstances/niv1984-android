 <h3>Proverbs 27</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-1">Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-2">Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-3">Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-4">Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy?</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-5">Better is open rebuke than hidden love.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-6">Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-7">He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-8">Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-9">Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-10">Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father, and do not go to your brother's house when disaster strikes you-- better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-11">Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-12">The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-13">Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-14">If a man loudly blesses his neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-15">A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-16">restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-17">As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-18">He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-19">As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-20">Death and Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_118115143_1">1</a>]</sup> are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-21">The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but man is tested by the praise he receives.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-22">Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding him like grain with a pestle, you will not remove his folly from him.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-23">Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds;</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-24">for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-25">When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-26">the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.</li>
  <li id="20-PROV-027-27">You will have plenty of goats' milk to feed you and your family and to nourish your servant girls.</li>
