 <h3>Ecclesiastes 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-1">The words of the Teacher, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_1">1</a>]</sup> son of David, king in Jerusalem:</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-2">"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-3">What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-4">Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-5">The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-6">The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-7">All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-8">All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-9">What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-10">Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-11">There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-12">I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-13">I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-14">I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-15">What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-16">I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-17">Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-001-18">For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.</li>
