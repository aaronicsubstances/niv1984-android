 <h3>Ecclesiastes 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-1">There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven:</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-2">a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-3">a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-4">a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-5">a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-6">a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-7">a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-8">a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-9">What does the worker gain from his toil?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-10">I have seen the burden God has laid on men.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-11">He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-12">I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-13">That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil--this is the gift of God.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-14">I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-15">Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-16">And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment--wickedness was there, in the place of justice--wickedness was there.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-17">I thought in my heart, "God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed."</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-18">I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-19">Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_2">2</a>]</sup> ; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-20">All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-21">Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_3">3</a>]</sup> goes down into the earth?"</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-003-22">So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?</li>
