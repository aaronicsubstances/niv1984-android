 <h3>Ecclesiastes 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-1">I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men:</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-2">God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-3">A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-4">It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-5">Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man--</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-6">even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-7">All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-8">What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-9">Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-10">Whatever exists has already been named, and what man is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than he.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-11">The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-006-12">For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</li>
