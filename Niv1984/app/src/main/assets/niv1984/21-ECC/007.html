 <h3>Ecclesiastes 7</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-1">A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-2">It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-3">Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-5">It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-6">Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-7">Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-8">The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-9">Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-10">Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-11">Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-12">Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-13">Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-14">When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-15">In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-16">Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise-- why destroy yourself?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-17">Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool-- why die before your time?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-18">It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all [extremes]. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-19">Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-20">There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-21">Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you--</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-22">for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-23">All this I tested by wisdom and I said, "I am determined to be wise"-- but this was beyond me.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-24">Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound-- who can discover it?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-25">So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-26">I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-27">"Look," says the Teacher, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_2">2</a>]</sup> "this is what I have discovered: "Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things--</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-28">while I was still searching but not finding-- I found one [upright] man among a thousand, but not one [upright] woman among them all.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-007-29">This only have I found: God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes."</li>
