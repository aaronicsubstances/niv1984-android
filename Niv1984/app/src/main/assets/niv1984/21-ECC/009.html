 <h3>Ecclesiastes 9</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-1">So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-2">All share a common destiny--the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_1">1</a>]</sup> the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-3">This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-4">Anyone who is among the living has hope <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_2">2</a>]</sup> --even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-5">For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-6">Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-7">Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-8">Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-9">Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun-- all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-10">Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_3">3</a>]</sup> where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-11">I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-12">Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-13">I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-14">There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-15">Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-16">So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-17">The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-009-18">Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</li>
