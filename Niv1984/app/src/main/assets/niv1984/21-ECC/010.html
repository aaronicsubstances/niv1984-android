 <h3>Ecclesiastes 10</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-1">As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-2">The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-3">Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-4">If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-5">There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler:</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-6">Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-7">I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-8">Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-9">Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-10">If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-11">If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-12">Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-13">At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness--</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-14">and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming-- who can tell him what will happen after him?</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-15">A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-16">Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup> and whose princes feast in the morning.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-17">Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time-- for strength and not for drunkenness.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-18">If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</li>
  <li id="21-ECC-010-20">Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.</li>
