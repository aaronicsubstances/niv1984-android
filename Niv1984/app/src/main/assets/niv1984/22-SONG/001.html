 <h3>Song of Solomon 1</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-1">Solomon's Song of Songs.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth-- for your love is more delightful than wine.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-3">Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-4">Take me away with you--let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup> ; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-5">Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-6">Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-7">Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-8">If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-9">I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-10">Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-11">We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-12">While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-13">My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-14">My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-15">How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-16">How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-001-17">The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.</li>
