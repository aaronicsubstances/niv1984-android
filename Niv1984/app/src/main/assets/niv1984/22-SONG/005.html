 <h3>Song of Solomon 5</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-1">I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink your fill, O lovers.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-2">I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night."</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-3">I have taken off my robe-- must I put it on again? I have washed my feet-- must I soil them again?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-4">My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-5">I arose to open for my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-6">I opened for my lover, but my lover had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_928170070_1">1</a>]</sup> I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-7">The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-8">O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you-- if you find my lover, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-9">How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you charge us so?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-10">My lover is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-11">His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-12">His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-13">His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-14">His arms are rods of gold set with chrysolite. His body is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_928170070_2">2</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-15">His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-005-16">His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my lover, this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</li>
