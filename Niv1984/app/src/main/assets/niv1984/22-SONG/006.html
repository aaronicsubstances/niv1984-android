 <h3>Song of Solomon 6</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-1">Where has your lover gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your lover turn, that we may look for him with you?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-2">My lover has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-3">I am my lover's and my lover is mine; he browses among the lilies.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-4">You are beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as troops with banners.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-5">Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-6">Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is alone.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-7">Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-8">Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number;</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-9">but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-10">Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-11">I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-12">Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="22-SONG-006-13">Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you! Why would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?</li>
