 <h3>Song of Solomon 8</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-1">If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-2">I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house-- she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-3">His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-4">Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-5">Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-6">Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_1">1</a>]</sup> unyielding as the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_2">2</a>]</sup> It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_3">3</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-7">Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_4">4</a>]</sup> would be utterly scorned.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-8">We have a young sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-9">If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-10">I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-11">Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_5">5</a>]</sup> of silver.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-12">But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_6">6</a>]</sup> are for those who tend its fruit.</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-13">You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!</li>
  <li id="22-SONG-008-14">Come away, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.</li>
