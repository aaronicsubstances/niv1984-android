 <h3>Isaiah 3</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-1">See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-2">the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-3">the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-4">I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-5">People will oppress each other-- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-6">A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-7">But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-8">Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-9">The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-10">Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-11">Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-12">Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-13">The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-14">The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-15">What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-16">The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-17">Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-18">In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-19">the earrings and bracelets and veils,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-20">the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-21">the signet rings and nose rings,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-22">the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-23">and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-24">Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-25">Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-003-26">The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.</li>
