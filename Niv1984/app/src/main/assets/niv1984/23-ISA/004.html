 <h3>Isaiah 4</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-1">In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-2">In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-3">Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-4">The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup> of judgment and a spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup> of fire.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-5">Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-004-6">It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.</li>
