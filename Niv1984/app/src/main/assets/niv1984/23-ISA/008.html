 <h3>Isaiah 8</h3>
 <ol>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-1">The LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-2">And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-3">Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-4">Before the boy knows how to say `My father' or `My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-5">The LORD spoke to me again:</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-6">"Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-7">therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_2">2</a>]</sup> -- the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-8">and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_3">3</a>]</sup> !"</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-9">Raise the war cry, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_4">4</a>]</sup> you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-10">Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_5">5</a>]</sup></li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-11">The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-12">"Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_6">6</a>]</sup> ; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-13">The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-14">and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-15">Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-16">Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-17">I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-18">Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-19">When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-20">To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-21">Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.</li>
  <li id="23-ISA-008-22">Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.</li>
